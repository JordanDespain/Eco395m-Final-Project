T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,1,My favorite hot dogs in Austin.   A pleasant  shady place with a fan to enjoy them.   Always friendly service.   And we are offered some seriously yummy options. Check the menu       Parking can sometimes be a problem but it s worth the try.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,2,Delicious hot dogs and burritos. The highlight is the tortillas- i dont know if they make in house but they are thin and delicious making a fantastic burrito. The meat is well seasoned and cooked  and the queso is top notch.  The hot dogs are great  they are a great version of a  danger dog  or  dirt dog  for anyone familiar with the los angeles staple street food. They are far from your typical dog- with onions  peppers  cheese  etc.- delicious.  Highly recommend a visit 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,3,Well  first of all the owners are great   Zulma greeted us warmly and chatted with us. Miguel  the chef  came out of the trailer to talk the menu over with us  I would not expect this at their busy times  . So the service was above good  it was great  And the food -- oh my god   Miguel is a real chef  far above what you might expect from a food trailer operator. My wife and I split a Sonoran  and it was incredibly good  Delicious bun  filled with toppings  just all around delicious. We also split a chicken taco and a cheese taco  happened to be vegetarian . Both were excellent. By the way  we drove some 20 miles from our house to go visit T-Loc   and it was totally worth it. We ll do it again the next time we want some delicious food. Totally recommend    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,4,Was in the mood for a hot dog and got to try my first Sonora Dog at T-Loc s.   The Sonora dog is loaded  but the one I had at T-Loc s felt short of expectation. I didn t taste much in the way of bacon or pinto beans  which are the two twoppings that set the Sonora dog from all other dogs. Also  the stnadard hot dog that T-Loc uses sdoesn t have much spicy zing or snap in the casing. They offer dogs from Hebrew  National and Granzin s Market for  1 and  1.50 more  respectively. I would strongly recommend getting them  but it d be even better if T-Loc s were to raise its price and make the Hebrew National dog standard.  However  I really liked the Fresco dog  topped with mashed avocado  sliced cucumber  and pico de gallo. Perfect for endless weeks of 98  degree evenigns in Austin. The different  and more subtle  flavors in the Fresco dog worked better than the Sonora dog  I thought. The steamed bun  sourced from Alejandro s Tortilla Factory in Tuscon was top-notch and held everything together. Also appreciated Chef Miguel for taking the time to chat with me and telling me more about the business.  Overall  definitely worth a visit. Make sure you get one of the non-standard hot dogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,5,Why 5 stars  Because when hot dogs are done well  they really hit the spot.             Hot dogs are kind of the butt of the joke in the food world  but a fancy hot dog is one of my favorite meals. And T-Loc s serves up some fancy hot dogs.  Pretty much all of them sounded good  so it was painful to only choose two  but I ultimately went with the Yaqui and the La Sonora.   The Yaqui was everything I hoped for when I decided to come here. The bun was toasted and delicious. The toppings smothered the dog itself  beans  onion  steak and cheese. Every bite was a dream.  To be honest  the La Sonora was a bit of a miss for me. It was basically a birria taco in hot dog form. But the flavor was just a bit off from every birria taco I ve tried to date. I didn t hate it  but the other dog was definitely my favorite.  I also ordered some ranch fries  which were an ideal pairing with the hot dogs. They were heavy  which prompted the owners to question if I was going to be able to eat everything by myself  but I told them I had the heart of a champion and I finished every last bite. The ranch fries were fries covered in ranch  bacon  cheese and onions  which was as great as it sounds like it would be.  In my brief chat with the owner s   they were really nice people and hoping to open a brick and mortar location soon. Hopefully that will happen and I can swing by to check it out next time I m in Austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,6,Summary  I love this place. The hotdogs are incredible and the owning family is kind and friendly. I have never had a bad experience here. Recently moved from Austin  and it will be one place I genuinely miss.   Good  Gotta go  con todo . Hot  cold  sweet  salty  savory  ...  it s got it all. And 1 is usually enough for me  and I m a pretty big guy. Love their ranch fries as well.   Bad  Outdoor seating is nice  but the truck area has flies and bugs.  Ugly  Nothing to note 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,7,The Sonoran Style Hot Dog is quite  frankly  one of the best hot dogs that I ve ever had. Miguel and Zulma  the owners  were explaining their origin  story as we were placing the order at the food truck. They are from Arizona and trying to bring Tuscon style hot-dogs to Austin.   Get the Sonora Hot Dog  It really combines  salty  spicy  sweet so well. It consists of a hot dog that is wrapped in bacon and grilled  served on a bolillo-style hot dog bun  and topped with pinto beans  onions  tomatoes  and a variety of additional condiments  often including mayonnaise  mustard  and jalape o salsa.  SO GOOD. It comes with roasted chili pepper and some chips.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,8,This place never disappoints  Very welcoming atmosphere. The owners are very nice and proud of their business. The Agua Frescas  strawberry orange specifically   .COM  but all are really good. Food so good made me think about them all week til I went again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,9,These guys are my fav hot dogs in the whole city.   I dont think they have anything on the menu here that isnt just the best. From the Carne Asada Fries to the Sonoran Style hot dogs you just cant go wrong. Even the Tacos are legit -af.   If youre in the mood for something special and want a hot dog this is the place. Youre not going to have a better hot dog experience anywhere in the city.   Dont skip. T-Loc knows whats up.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,10,Let s be frank... these dogs ain t no joke   Highlights   Carne Asada Fries   Sonoran Style Hotdogs   Aguas Frescas   Review  This has become my new lunch spot which is conveniently close to work. I order the Yaqui Dog  carne asada fries and an agua fresca.  The Yaqui Dog was a rollercoaster of flavor with notes of sweetness from the saut ed onions  smokiness from the carne asada  nuttiness from the pinto beans  fattiness from the bacon wrapped hot dog  creaminess from the cheese and slight acidity to complement everything from the jalape o sauce. The highlight however were the carne asada fries  they had the perfect amount of asada  fries were cooked perfectly  creaminess from the crema added depth  freshness from the pico and the pickled garnish just took it to the next level. Everything was delicious and it was all washed down with a refreshing agua fresca. Can t wait to go back for another lunch adventure.   Rating  10 10  Yaqui Dog Bacon-wrapped S-Bar hot dog  pinto beans  sauteed onions  carne asada  Monterrey Jack cheese   amp  jalape o sauce. Served with chips. Chile guero available on request  Carne Asada Fries Crinkle cut fries  1 4lb of carne asada  pico de Gallo  mexican crema  japale o drizzle  monterrey jack cheese  amp  garnish
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,11,Hot dog  This place is tucked in at the 5000 Burnet food truck park. Been here several times over the years and they re consistently delicious  I ve tried almost everything on the menu  but tried and true is their Sonoran hot dog con todo. It has their bacon-wrapped dog  pinto beans  tomatoes  onions  mayo  mustard and jalapeno sauce. Sounds like a lot  but the flavors work so well together. The couple that owns the truck are super friendly. Pro tip  ask for the guero pepper. It s not super spicy but it s a delicious grilled pepper with salt sprinkled on it. Adds a nice dimension when you eat it with your hot dog. If you re a fan of Sonoran hot dogs or curious  stop in at T-Loc s 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,12,I know you see hotdog in the menu and think nothing can be amazing here but you re dead wrong. This is one of the greatest hotdogs spots as well as taco burrito they go all in on flavor. Nothing here is basic it s made with passion and quality ingredients stacked up to give you a mouth punch of flavor. Staff here is amazing ownership is passionate and wants to give you the best and by the way they are award-winning yes is a must try. Then you will just keep going back wake me see you soon 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,13,Okay wow talk about a yummy hot dog  Tried this once when my family was in town and have been back a few times since then  I really enjoy the flavors of their sonoran hot dig  though will say this is a better experience eating there. When I did pickup  it was a bit longer of a wait since I had to drive which left the bottom of the bun a bit soggy. Also really loved their carne asada burrito  10 10 would recommend  and everyone that works there is super nice too
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,14,A few months ago Way South Philly closed.  Being from Philly a quarterly visit will be missed.  Luckily I have found a new go to spot in T-Loc s.   The Sonoran dog is out of this world.   This dog hits all parts of the taste spectrum.  Outstanding.   Also the fries with the Aioli made me weak in the knees and broke my no fry diet.   It was worth it.   The owner has a great background having spent his childhood in Hawaii and loved to surf.  I really enjoyed talking to him.   The burrito is probably worth a try on another day.  It will be hard to order with the option of a Sonora.   Maybe I need to starve myself for a day and get both.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,15,This place is a food truck located in a parking lot with a bunch of other very tasty food trucks  too  They have their own seating right next to the truck  which is also lit at night  super convenient.  As for the Sonoran dog.. just get it. It is 100x better than the ones I ve tried in Tucson  where they re apparently very popular . Everything just tastes fresher and is more neatly put together than I remember having before. Nothing negative to say about it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,16,The hot dog definitely tasted special with the toasted bun  amp  fillings galore  but not mind-blowing or anything. I loved the pepper on the side. It definitely added some heat to every bite.   Also ordered the tacos a la plancha. Two small-sized tacos with corn tortillas. It came with beans and cabbage slaw. The beef inside was nicely grilled charred. Tortillas were also fresh and toasty. But yeah it s more like a snack than a meal.  Will try other items next time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,17,Truly I wasn t sure if I wanted a hog dog to start... BUT these are so GOOD. I got the Sonoran hot dog and Ranch fries. The hot dog was so yummy and flavorful. The ranch fries were definitely shareable and once again so flavorful.  Also the owner came by and was so friendly. Big thumbs up from myself and my friends.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,18,Revisited T-Loc s and he s still delivering the goods  Try them out for an out-of-this-world hot dog experience 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,19,My son brought me here. I had the Sonoran dog with everything and had some of the carne asada fries too  The Agua Fresca was very refreshing on a hot day in Austin. Everything was wonderful   Highly recommend . Go check this food truck out   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,20,A must if you re in austin  Love the food  You cant go wrong with anything. Been here several times and will continue to  Owner is very welcoming 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,21,BEST HOTDOGS IN AUSTIN        I hope that was loud enough. Because it s true.   T-Locs sports the most meticulously crafted hotdogs in Austin. They re main attraction  the Sonora Hot Dog  is absolutely  the epidemy of hotdogs. Soft steamed bun  the actual dog itself smothered in a wide range of ingredients that compliment each other in this extraordinary chorus of hotdog universe.  Not only do they have amazing hot dogs but they re sides are just as great. My fav side to pair with a hot dog is the ranch fries. Again  a collection of so many different ingredients to form an amazing basket of fries.   Service is amazing with the chef duo cranking out orders with care and love.   An amazing place  a must try in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,22,I love this crap  It tastes really good  Especially the hot dogs  The chicken burritos are really good too  Thanks
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,23,Deliciousness    Bacon Wrapped Dog  amp  carne asada fries were so good                    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,24,We got the Sonoran hot dog without the pinto beans and it was soooo good    I had the agua fresca it was strawberry and orange. It was so refreshing and good. It wasn t too sweet or sour it was just perfect  The fries were very crispy and a big serving enough for two. 10 10
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,25,Do it   Support local   You won t regret it  This little hot dog burrito french fries with garlic aioli place is awesome....o  M gosh.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,26,Been craving a good hot dog. Was not disappointed. Solid Sonoran dog was on point. Their papas Bravas were just the right side. Plenty of parking and night lights offer a good spot to catch a late dinner.   Coming back for the carne asada fries
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,27,I DON T EVEN KNOW  WHAT   WHO   The hot dog I had  was way to good to share. So I didn t. The carne asada fries looked good enough to snatch from my boyfriend  so I did  All the food we got was mouth watering. The food was not overly seasoned  I genuinely didn t feel bloated or felt sleepy when you eat cheesy goodness  instead I felt like I was missing a cold beer. I can not recommend the food enough  we re going back to try the entire menu. The only thing we forgot to do is take a picture of the quesadilla and that s mostly because we had finished the entire thing before we could  but the cheese pull... money shots all around  the food taste as fantastic as it looks  Great place  lots of places to sit and the vibe was awesome
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,28,Great Sonoran Dog and Carne Asada Tacos. Will be back to try other things on the menu. Staff were very friendly and gave me good insight on the inspiration of their menu ingredients.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,29,Amazing. Every single time. Whoever makes The Sonora dip is doing gods work. The fries are necessary y agua Fresca
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,30,Friendly chef   Thank you  Tastes so good and flavorful  hope set up  2 in downtown of Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,31,They are from Tucson  AZ and we used to live there when my hubby was stationed there in the Air Force. We found out about this place when my hubby was craving carne asada burritos - we are originally from San Diego where they have the best carne asada burritos. Ordered the carne asada burritos the first time we went and that was back in 2019 - taste just like the ones in San Diego - delicious  Miguel and his wife always take the time to talk to us when they re not busy and the food never disappoints. When family comes to visit from San Diego  we take them there and they agree that it s as good as the carne asada burritos in San Diego.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,32,This place is a favorite of mine.  Even though the husband and wife team that lovingly run this place are from Tucson  they placed in the Great ATX El Paso Mexican Food Challenge before Covid hit.  The Sonora Dogs are unbelievably good  but I had the opportunity to see their catering chops this Cinco de Mayo.   Drowned Taquitos Ala El Paso  are around 20 to 50x better than Chicos.  I ate several sober and wanted more  something I ve never been able to claim about Chico s.  Either at their trailer on Burnet or catering your next affair  I love T-Loc... both food and family.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,33,Got 2 Sonoran dogs. They were really good but neither dog was wrapped in bacon. Bummer.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,34,I think it s refreshing to see a product advertise and for once it is actually exactly as advertised and as you see in the photos  Having lived in Arizona and have had Sonoran hotdogs there I would say these are as authentic as they get  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu  Ah and the owner operator was very personable so that makes the whole experience that much better.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,35,Super friendly and funny owners  The main Sonoran hot dog is the best  The perfect balance of flavors. You guys are awesome  and your awards have definitely been earned.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,36,This place makes legit Sonoran Hot Dogs. Bacon wrapped dogs with jalapeno  mayo  mustard and beans. The cinnamon infused bread buns are shipped in from a bakery in Tucson  AZ. If you have never tried a Sonoran hot dog  you need to come here. Come with your friends and order a dozen of them. Make it a celebration to life 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,37,Every time I m missing home I make my way to T-Loc s. The Sonora Dog is AMAZING  Best food truck in Austin by far 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,38,Absolutely astounding hotdog. Would heavily encourage anyone to try it. Amazing service  remarkably delicious hotdogs. Love the cheese  jalape o sauce  seasoning  bacon  everything. 5 5
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,39,Great hotdogs. Great service. Great people. Highly recommend to anyone looking for amazing food with amazing people to brighten up your day. WILL be making this a frequent meal.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,40,Simplemente los mejores. Los due os tienen la mejor vibra siempre que voy me hacen sentir como familia. Y la comida ni se diga. 10 10
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,41,Super tasty dog.  Not a sausage on crusty bun with mustard.  Instead an amazing mix of ingredients.  Bacon wrapped dog on a soft squishy steamed bun with a pile of messy ingredients on top.  Beans.  Tomatoes.  Onions.  And then three sauces.  Might drip on you while eating so take care.  They also have tacos and burritos but I ve only ever had the Sonoran dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,42,Absolutely amazing   True authentic Sonoran hotdogs. If you re from Arizona and miss a slice of home then this is a MUST stop for you. We ordered two Sonoran dogs with a carne asana burrito. Authentic carne burrito with just meat  pico  and guac. Customer service was too notch  we met and talked with the owner for a bit  you can tell he s passionate about what he does. We will be repeat customers.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,43,My husband loves their Sonoran dogs but I am all about the ranch fries. The dill in the ranch sauce makes them crazy tasty. Burritos and tacos are solid and they have really good tortillas. Convenient order ahead options online w pickup at the truck  if you don t want to wait there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,44,I love their hot dog  Upgrade to the Hebrew National bc it really does make a difference. They ve added a bunch of stuff to their menu in recent years  so if you haven t been in a while  you should go  go  go again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,45,I ve been here about 5 times and every single time has been incredible. The owners are very kind and seem to know everyone by name  you can tell they care about their customers as much as their food. As much as I d like to recommend something specific  you really can t go wrong with anything 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,46,OMG the carne asada plate is the stuff dreams are made of. The line can get long but the wait is absolutely worth it. The hotdogs are amazing as well but the care asada is where it s at 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,47,We stopped by after a few years not coming due to distance. I looked at our last review which was the first time we ever came here in 2014.The place has changed.They added tables umbrellas decorations. Looks great   time has passed and we change .Could not remember what the female owner has a unique name.We come to the window  lady walks away does not say one moment to us. Comes back to window My husband says hi the friendly person that he is.Her response was a huh or something. My husband said does Sulma still work here she sarcastically said yes I live here.Come to find out 7 yrs have gone by we change you changed.Did not mean no disrespect.My husband said my wife has been wanting a CA burrito  I kept telling her this place may have it.We stopped by Sulema sarcastically said she don t need to come you could have came I don t know about her but she can you know. I was shocked of the unfriendly service we experienced and rudest as we were one of her first reviews and promoted by mouth. We love supporting small businesses. I get it you may be stressed as you were busy today when we came.However  our experience was very disappointing.I wish reviews could have the stars seperated. My rating is based off her rudeness. I guess we expected her same kindness we recieved in 2014.We have come many times before and there was no need for another review she has alwys been respectful.The food as always excellent .Shocked is all.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,48,A bit pricy but worth the flavor. My go tos are usually the Sonora and the Yaqui dog with their agua fresca. I didn t think I would get full with just two hot dogs but they fill them up with all the works  beans cheese  salsa  bacon  that it definitely fills you up. If you re craving something new or some hot dogs you have to give these Sonoran dogs a try. You won t regret it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,49,I AM OBSESSED  Best food truck in atx  The service is great the food is delicious  . Love this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,50,Amazing food - highly recommend everything on the menu. The flavors are amazing and the tortillas are super fresh. I have had the burritos  plates and tacos and nothing has missed. Super nice owners and great vibes.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,51,This is my buddy s favorite place to eat in Austin. So of course  I had to try it  And man was I blown away. I ve had bacon-wrapped hot dogs before. But this was a whole nother level. The toppings added so much extra flavor. But the real game changer here was the bun. Not only was the bun soft and sweet  it was strong enough to hold everything on the whole time. Nothing fell off whenever I took a bite.  This was my last going out meal before quarantine started and you best believe it will be my first when quarantine is over 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,52,I am obsessed with their hot dogs   Specially the Chile g eros they have. My favorite is their Sonoran hot dog. This is definitely a place I can eat every day at.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,53,Yes  yes and more yes. The only place I know where you can get authentic and delicious Sonoran style Mexican food. I miss these Arizona style burritos more than anything...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,54,If I could give this place all the stars in the world I would. The people that work there are as amazing as the food. Definitely one of my favorite places in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,55,We knew we wanted to try this place the first time we visited the Food Truck park. And  today was the day for T-Loc s. We all went Sonoran style and  WOW  firm believer in doing it the way the chef intends at least on the first round. Perfection  That bun  the crispy dog  fresh toppings... the jalape o sauce... and the aioli on the fries... fresh  not your ordinary hot dog.. plus we got to hear a little about the origins of the cuisine... great experience and we will be back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,56,As a Tucson local who just moved to Austin  TX  I was craving a good spot of Sonoran Mexican food. That craving was satisfied by T Loc s  Their carne asada tacos were amazing and very authentic  the Sonoran hot dogs were incredible and I couldn t recommend this food truck more 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,57,This is just one of those spots. IYKYK  Their hot dogs are phenomenal you just can t go wrong. Their ranch fries are also great so don t sleep on them like I did on my first visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,58,The Sonoran hot dog is great  The burritos and fries are also very good. Lots of flavor. The folks running the truck are very attentive.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,59,Truly authentic Sonoran Hot dogs  great tasting  lots of flavor. Staff was very friendly and attentive  place is very clean...but best of all great tasting food. Better than Gueros.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,60,T-locs is by far my favorite food truck in Austin  They ve got the best hot dogs  The buns are delicious  the sausage is wrapped with bacon  and don t get me started on the caramelos  it s like a quesadilla but much tastier . The people working the food truck are really friendly.  Unfortunately they re closed on Sundays.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,61,Everything we ordered was delicious  T-Loc s did not disappoint. The hot dog definitely lives up to the hype. I ve never had anything like it. I usually don t enjoy hot dogs but this one is on a whole  nother level. I would recommend upgrading the hot dog from the Bar S or else the hot dog meat will get overpowered by the other flavors which isn t necessarily a bad thing at all  I guess it s just what you prefer. The carne asada fries also tied for favorite dish. The spicy pickled carrots and jalape os are an excellent touch. The torta and the taco were also excellent. I recommend trying one of everything tbh  The customer service is on point too. Everyone seems to love what they do there. This place has a very welcoming feeling to it. I can t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,62,Friendly folks.  Good hot dogs.  I usually get the ones with everything.  I go during the week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,63,Yummy    Didn t think I would like mayonnaise on a hot dog but this was awesome   Great customer service 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,64,I m not sure why I haven t reviewed this place yet - the sonoran-style hot dog here is amazing  and it s better not just than other hot  dogs  which aren t many to be honest   but to most sandwiches and burgers in general.   It has a complex flavor and texture  which again is particularly impressive since it s a hod dog. It s fresh and creamy and meaty and toasty.  One thing I will note - I also recently went again and tried the burrito  and while it was pretty good  it was nowhere near as good as the amazing hot dog so I would recommend just getting those when you come  more than 1 if you want a bigger meal.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,65,The bun makes the hot dog. It s crispy and gives it a crunch. I love all the sauces they drizzle on the hotdog too and all the onions tomatoes.   It s a bit messy  so don t come on a first date.    Overall it s good  but I was expecting the sausage itself to be more unique.   I m torn between giving them 3 or 4 stars. It s hard for a hotdog to blow my mind.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,66,Love their Sonora style hotdogs.. The carne asada burrito is also great and it s the best burrito in Austin.     Mike and Zulma are really nice  friendly and even gave our pup a treat     When we had friends or family visiting from Cali I would take them to T- Locs.   If you re in Austin go check them out  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,67,This great little food truck right off of Burnet Road has some of the best hotdogs you will ever taste in your life  They also have super fast and friendly service. The hotdog bun was probably the best hotdog bun I ve ever tasted  and I understand they are flown in a couple of times a week from Tucson. You won t go wrong with a visit to this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,68,One of the best veggie hot dogs period. We ordered just 1 first and than before finishing it we had second one already being ordered which tells how much we liked it. Heard a lot of good reviews about them and this one lived out to the expectation. People who work here are also very kind and friendly. The cheese tacos were also good but beware of the side grilled
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,69,The best hot dogs in Austin bar none....we are repeat customers and it always a treat to be able to there.  You have to get a Sonora dog - all the way and a yaky.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,70,When you think of hot dogs  backyard barbecues and New York come to mind. Well  consider T-Loc s a part of that image now   I ordered the Veggie Sonoran Dog and the biggest difference is it s not bacon-wrapped and it s vegenaise instead of mayo. The most impressive part of the hot dog is the bun - perfectly toasted while still being light and airy. This is a seriously loaded hot dog  in the best way possible  so it feels like you get a new bite every time.   And their Chicken and Cheese Quesadilla was seriously one of the best quesadillas I ve ever eaten  The tortilla was beautiful looking and tasting because of the flattop they re cooking it on  something you can never exactly replicate at home .   I think the price for quality and quantity of food is great. The owners were friendly and my order didn t take too long to be ready.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,71,I want to talk soccer  but I don t wanna BORE HER I wanna go to sleep  but I still wanna EXPLORE HER I have to make sure that I don t come BEFORE HER But first I ll take her to T-Loc s SONORA  I found their business card in my sock DRAWER I come here when I m richer  come when I m POORER She doesn t like it much  but whatevs  I still ADORE HER And I ll still keep coming back to T-Loc s SONORA  Tastes almost as good as the late SEXY CORA It made me so sad  as I had so much love FOR HER No-one can deny I m the best food TOURER And one of the best hot dogs I ve had s at T-Loc s SONORA  WHAT  Sonora later you have to try T-Loc s Sonora.  Me and the sexy goddess have totally different opinions on this place which is fine because we often do.  If they sold Grease gang members  it d be T-Bird s Sonora.  I love these messy Mexican hot dogs and this one reminds me of the ones that they sell in Los Angeles and in San Francisco on the streets after the clubs let out and whatnot or in Downtown LA during the daytime.  If they sold steaks  it d be T-Bone s Sonora.  The people running this truck are actually from Tucson Arizona  but they must know how the Mexicans make their dogs because it s actually really good. I was honestly really surprised about how good it was.  If they were the best boba chain ever  it d be T-Top s Sonora.  You may think it s a little steep  price wise. But compared to some of the other trucks here it s not even overpriced. I mean it s not cheap but it s not ridiculously over-the-top like some of the others are - and you do get a huge delicious juicy Perfection product that will probably fill you up.  Speaking of hot dogs that will fill you up.  Anyway.  If they liked to molest you while pretending to check for contraband  it d be TSA-Loc s Sonora.  The guys working here incredibly nice too  and the girls as well. They were very inquisitive as to whether we liked it and asked us to spread the word - and little do they know that I have quite a few followers on Yelp LOL. So listen to me and go and give it a try because it s worth it. In fact  it s like L Oreal in that regard  but much  much better tasting.  And if they sold male chastity devices  they d be D-Lock s Sonora.  But I m really  really glad that they don t.  One of the best hot dogs in the country  maybe the best in Texas. When it comes to the best dogs in Austin  they ve got it on D-Lock.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,72,One of the best hot dogs I ve ever had  I grab pizza rolls over by Rockin rolls then I grab a Sonoran dog as well. They have great carne asada tacos if you re not feeling hot dogs. The couple who run this spot work hard and are always so friendly. I drive from San Antonio to eat here and it s worth it every time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,73,Was on my way back to campus when I decided to pull up Yelp and see what was good in the area. Found this place with a 5 star rating and delicious photos so my mind was set. Ordered the sonora hot dog first and then just had to try the carne asada taco.  For the hot dog  man that bun is just so so soft  All the ingredients come together with so many different flavors  one of the best hot dogs i ve had  For the carne asada taco  it has to be the juiciest carne asada Ive ever had. I had to balance the taco otherwise if I tilted it in either direction  the juice would just run right out  The owners you can tell absolutely love what they do and their passion shows in their great cooking    Definitely coming back here   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,74,I rarely update my reviews.  This is the first time in over 1000 reviews that I have updated twice.  Why the update here   Because there is news.  I normally am a fan of the T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog.  The T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog is my idea of a treat.  The T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog is how I reward myself.  If this is not the time or place for a long night of infused vodkas from Russian House  then I go to T-Loc and get myself a hot dog.  The world then becomes perfect.  Well due to certain conditions beyond my control - the astrological sign was wrong or something like that - I didn t go with my normal hot dog.  I went with the Carne Asada burrito.  I took the liberty - which is NOT house style - of reheating the burrito at home with the avocado inside of it.  I have had T-Loc s Carne Asada plates with cool avocado.  I have had the Carne Asada Burrito with warm mashed down avocado.  Trust me on this one - the warm avocado takes the dish to a brand new level.  The steak and the seasonings are already epic.   The steak has always been majorly majorly epic.   Their sauces are already outstanding.  The warmed avocado takes the dish to Godhead.  Normally - coronavirus is sad because we have to take all our truck food home.   And  by the way  people are dying too.   Coronavirus making us reheat food in the microwave is an awesome opening.  I have not been this happy with a burrito in a long long time.  T-Loc s Carne Asada Burrito is a wonderful source of happiness while all the world falls apart around us.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,75,OMG. Sonora Dog. With everything.  Wrapped in bacon  with beans  tomato  onion  mayo  mustard and I m sure I m forgetting things . Add cheese and carne asada. I could end the review there. But I won t.  So  this is the first time I have ever only eaten half a hot dog. Why you ask  Because it was so good  I want to have the other half for lunch or snack another day. I know that pretty much makes me certifiable. I don t care.  I have a theory about certain foods  finger foods of sorts such as dogs  burgers  sandwiches  etc. if it wasn t messy  it wasn t good. Or at least it wasn t made right. A good one of any of those should be more than sloppy. You should unquestionably be required to like not just your fingers after  but also the rest of your hand s . And THEN go wash them.  This hot dog not only didn t disappoint  it raised the bar. It is the gold standard. I can complain about only one thing. It needs more spice to actually be spicy. But that s not a real complaint because that thing was good. Very  very good.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,76,Hard to describe the sonoran dog. It s simply...delicious. And the staff is as exceptional as the meal. What a gem.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,77,The best hot dog and carne asada fries i ve had  might want to get it to-go or the mosquitoes will eat you
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,78,So amazing  I grew up in Tucson and was raised on Sonoran style food. This is a perfect slice of home. Very authentic and delicious  I always order at least two Sonoran dogs every time I come and their Agua Fresca tastes amazing and is refreshing.   Highly recommend ordering  con todo 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,79,This place did not disappoint -the owner and staff were very friendly and welcoming. This was my first time here -but it will not be the last. The food was outstanding well prepared and super delicious I had the Sonoran dog with all the extras it was delicious.My daughter and grandson both have the loaded Yaqui dog topped with a fried egg. Also shared a large order of their very delicious ranch fries. I recommend if you wanna great hotdog experience give this place a try .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,80,I haven t eaten a hot dog since I was 13. I m almost 23 and this was the best hot dog I ve ever had. Also the folks behind the counter are sooo nice  I haven t had such good food  amp  hospitality in a long time  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,81,The guy who makes the hot dogs is super nice and welcoming. I ordered the yaqui dog and carne asada fries. 10 10 recommend this place food is bomb. Going to try the eggsplosion next time I come.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,82,Everything here is great  you can t go wrong. Very impressed by the vegan dog. It s a flavor explosion. Everything is fresh and you can taste it. We haven t found a better Sonora style dog  The Owners staff are very friendly  Such a gem 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,83,Damn this was so good my eyes rolled back onto my head  I moaned out load that I got stares on first bite. We had the Sonoran hot dog which was the perfect combination of sweet  salty  sour and spicy. The carne asada taco and Baja burrito were perfect as well with super fresh toasted tortillas. Don t miss out on the unusual agua Fresca flavors which we had the strawberry Orange.  This place gets all the praise.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,84,Very nice owner. The hotdog was delicious. I also tried their pineapple aqua fresca. Probably one of the best I ve had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,85,Don t be fooled by the name of the truck. We had the Asada quesadilla and it was good as you can get. There s probably more Mexican food options than hot dogs. I d recommend the owners figure out to their guests about their amazing Mexican food. Be patient they were a little slow but worth the wait.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,86,Amazing food. Despite the rather small trailer  the food they put out here is amazing. We ordered two sonora dogs and carne asada fries and can t wait to go back. They even have a small and mostly socially distanced area for eating.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,87,DELICIOUS. Can t believe I waited this long to try this place. I am only halfway done with my hotdog and I m already sad in anticipation of it being gone. I got the Sonoran hot dog and a cucumber lime aguas fresca. Crispy bacon  soft but toasted bun  excellent toppings  delicious pinto beans. 10 10  I want to get another one immediately.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,88,Yesterday I had a life-changing experience.  New to the Austin area  I wanted a hot-dog  googled  and found T-Loc s Sonora.  Having once lived in the Los Angeles area  I was already familiar with bacon-wrapped dogs piled high with delicious additions  so immediately upon seeing pictures  my mouth was watering  and I was ready to find them.  As I was reading through the reviews  I noticed lots of enthusiasm around their steak burrito.  It was a tough decision to decide between the two  so I ordered one of each.   -   I had ordered online  and the food was ready well before I found their place  not hard to find  but being new here I just didn t know the area .  When I pulled in to their lot  one of their staff came to bring my order right away.  They were gracious and kind.  Great Service   Great service is good  but really  it s all about the food  right   T-Loc s Sonoran hotdogs are absolutely wonderful   Their dogs are flavorful with bacon-y wrapped goodness  the toppings are generous but balanced enough to be flavorful and not too too messy  just a little .  A true Sonoran dog isn t like getting a hotdog with stuff just slathered on top. It s got enough ingredients that it must be crafted well...no single item should overpower the flavors of the rest.  And then there s the bun...  Yes  the bun is very special.  It s something very different than your typical hotdog bun.  It s steamed instead of grilled  so it s soft  moist  ever so slightly sweet and delicious      It absorbs the ingredients enough to become an integral part of the dish.  Often I find myself discarding  extra  bits of bun...in this case  I couldn t get enough of it.  T-Loc s Sonoran Hotdogs are simply incredible   But there s more...  As good as the hotdogs were  and I will return for more   T-Loc s Carne Asada Burrito was the heart of the life changing experience.  It s deceptively simple.  It s a flour tortilla filled with steak  pico de gallo  and avocado.  Two bites into it  the second bite only to confirm what I suspected after my first bite   I realized that  although I ve traveled the world and eaten many burritos   I was eating the BEST burrito I have ever tasted   Again  perfect balance of flavors...but a Carne Asada SO bursting with flavor that just thinking about it a day later makes my mouth water again.  You may not associate words like food truck  hotdogs  and burritos with the word gourmet...until you visit T-Loc s Sonoran  then your life will be changed.  Food like this doesn t  just happen  by accident.  It s created and crafted by a deliberate act of art  love and passion.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,89,If I could design a perfect hot dog for myself  it would look nothing like the  con todo  served here... and it would taste nowhere near as good. It s not an especially big or especially cheap item  but its quality still makes it especial. And as with most food trucks  there are friendly people behind the counter to take and make your order. Conclusion  I ll be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,90,Burritos  hotdogs and carne asada fried were all on point  Fire  Definitely recommend if in the area
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,91,Food is awesome as always I wish I could eat here every day. Service amazing as always same with food eat a Sonora dog today.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,92,I can t stop ordering the Ranch Fries from T-Loc s. They are  as my husband says   stupid good.  The hot dogs are phenomenal  but now that I know about the fries  I have a difficult decision to make every time. Anyway  you really can t go wrong with anything here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,93,Okay  let me just start off by saying that their hotdogs taste just like the hotdogs back home  These are true AUTHENTIC Sonoran dogs. The ONLY ones I ll eat here in Texas. You truly will not be disappointed  Also  shoutout to all my Arizona peeps  Gotta represent
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,94,Shame on me for not reviewing this gem sooner  they deserve our utmost support and patronage for their outstanding mastery of the secret Sonoran treasure known as the hot dog.   Seriously  this is the ONLY place I ve been to outside of Tucson that does this right. Sonoran dogs are diamonds  rare  hard to find  and one of quality is worth more than gold.   The Sonoran Hot Dogs here are works of art. In a city obsessed with great food  T-Locs stands out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,95,This food is the real deal flavors of Sonora   Fresh  well flavored meats  we the tacos a la plancha  the carne asada and torta and Sonoran hotdog.   Authentic flavors  fresh bread  well seasoned meats.  I ll be back soon 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,96,The owner Miguel is so sweet and makes sure your experience is top notch. The Sonoran hot dogs are definitely something you can t get in elsewhere. The variety of hotdogs suits anyone s needs - traditional pork  Hebrew National beef  and veggie dogs. I also got carne asada fries which were loaded with 1 4 lb of meat along with great accoutrements. This food truck is always hoppin  and rightly so 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,97,First time trying this place and it was sooo good  For me the loaded fries were the best  It s a bit of a drive for me but will deff go again. Dk if he is the owner or who he was but love that he came out and talk to me asked how I was liking the food. Nice touch 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,98,I was craving dessert and decided as a nearby suggestion found this food truck park... and somehow convinced myself get hot dogs as well. The Sonora hot dog sounded quite interesting while passing by  and decided to try some. The people who run the truck are absolutely amazing  super friendly  funny  and passionate about their business. Mustard is something I usually avoid and usually ask to keep off my hot dogs  but after some convincing from Miguel I decided to keep it on. Despite being a super busy truck that day  it only took about 5 minutes to get both hot dogs.   For the food  the hotdogs are absolutely amazing. Honestly probably the best hot dog I ve had. There s so many flavors that I m surprised they all mesh together so nicely. I probably ate the entire hot dog in like 2 minutes. Highly recommend and will be my new stop for whenever I m craving a hot dog now. We also ordered the Carne Asada fries  but the meat was a little bit too salty for me to eat. But all around an amazing food truck 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,99,I love Sonora Dogs but really not had a proper one since El Guero Canelo in Tuscon. But  this place might be just as good or better  How could anyone not like a bacon wrapped hot dog with essentially taco filling inside a sweet fluffy toasted bun. Also add to the story that serve they have a Ranch Fries that are covered in bacon  cheese  homemade ranch with crinkle cut fries     This is a must have item for sure to go with your dogs you will for sure double fist.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,100,Their Sonora Hot Dog is exactly what I wanted out of a delicious  new flavor of a classic treat. The bun on this thing is so soft but holds it s structure  the beans are full of flavor  the sauces work perfectly together and the bacon adds to the overall texture and bite of the hot dog. This is a new favorite spot of mine.   This lot has about 8 food trucks all with a nice variety of things from ice cream tacos to Thai food and JewBoys Burgers. It s great  Got to check this out if you want a break from your normal routine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,101,Heard about T-Loc s through word of mouth and this is by far the best. Not only is the food amazing  the owners areal so awesome and friendly  the vibe is like friends all hanging out in the backyard eating amazing food. The hot dogs wrapped in bacon  with added ingredients I wouldn t think to add on makes my mouth water just writing this. The tacos are also fantastic but you must and absolutely must order the carne Asada fries  can t even explain how amazing those are   hurry  Asada sells out fast  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,102,Good food and the owner is a cool dude that takes pride in his product.  Can t really ask for more than that. And those hot peppers  ahhhh 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,103,They make you feel like family   VIP treatment and the food is always consistently delicious 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,104,From day one my family and I have loved this place   The owners are very friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious.  Best hotdogs in Austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,105,Absolutely the best burrito in Austin.  Locally owned and operated and community focused. Definitely give them a try
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,106,Hot dog this place is so yummy   I recommend it all.  It s a little truck in the food truck park off burnet.  Dessert is also really tasty.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,107,I didn t know a hot dog could be that good  I can t wait to go back to try more from the menu. Absolutely amazing 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,108,Every now and then I crave a good weenie. Who doesn t  If you want something really unique  to ATX anyway   visit T-Loc s and go all in by ordering a legit Sonoran  as in Mexico  hot dog with all its toppings  aka  con todo    dog wrapped in bacon topped with pinto beans  caramelized  onions  raw onions  tomato  and squirts of mayo  mustard  and Caribbean pepper sauce. It looks intimidating and sounds a bit confusing  but wow  what a mouthful of yum  Yes  the Sonoran style dog is as messy to eat as it looks. That s okay - the uber friendly owner  Miguel  won t hesitate to provide you with a big handful of napkins  is it sinful to ask for a fork  ...and tell you about his journey and explain exactly what the heck a Sonoran is. In short  it s tasty  it s different  it s filling  and it ll only set you back 5 bucks  add  1 if you prefer a Hebrew National .    If you re not feeling particularly adventurous  T-Loc s does offer some standard dogs  as well as burritos  quesadillas  some breakfast items and more...BUT please at least try a Sonoran once. Admittedly  my minimalist French s mustard only on hot dog hubby wasn t a huge fan. In any event  he can at least say he s had and knows what a Sonoran is. Culture - food - good.  D  Note  to keep their food as legit as possible  the buns and tortillas are shipped in from AZ. Now that s commitment to quality.   Tip  T-Loc s food trailer is located in the 5000 Burnet  food court   parking is a breeze  and you can BYOB. Cheers 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,109,Great service food is amazing     I had carne assada fries and hot dog   totally recommend
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,110,There s a reason why this place is 5 stars on Yelp. The people who run the truck are SO friendly  they informed us about everything and were kind and patient.   Me and my friend ordered the Con Todo hot dog and the Carne Asada burrito. The guy who runs it wiped down the tables for us because it was raining. Talk about caring for his customers  He brought out the food to us and it looked delicious. He even told us the origin of the name and where they came from. In Arizona  there s plenty of hot dog stands but none in Austin. How cool that he shared that with us.   Unfortunately I had to be on the phone for an insurance call  so I m not sure if the hot dog got a little soggy in the bread. Nonetheless  it was yummy.   But the burrito was amazing. I dream about it sometimes. Like  damn  The sauce is fantastic and the limes compliment it so well.   If you have to order something  get the carne asada burrito. You won t regret it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,111,I ve never had a better hot dog  The bun is so good  not sure what type of bread it is  but it s great. Just try this place  it ll become one of your favorites.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,112,If you want Sonoran style food come here  Absolutely the best Sonoran hot dog in Texas  Great food  Great service 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,113,Stumbled upon this place when we visited Austin. We ordered Sonoran hotdogs  carne asada fries  beef burrito  and agua Fresca. Everything was good. 4 stars because price was a bit high for hotdogs with added toppings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,114,Oh  gosh I loved their food. Their hotdog is so good  especially the bread. I also tried their fries  which was super good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,115,This dog is awesome. The toppings mix for an unbelievably tasty bite. The bun is slightly sweet and just perfectly dense.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,116,This is the carne asada burrito I have been in search of. No frills  just carne  pico de gallo  and guacamole. None of the other junk that everyone else seems to think they need to put inside burritos here in Austin.  If you are familiar with the  berto  chain of hole in the wall Mexican food places all over southern California and Arizona  this will remind you exactly of those burritos.  The carne here is better quality than what I remember the socal chain to be.  I will have to give the hot dogs a try next time but it will be tough to pass up the burrito so I might have to save my macros and go for both.   Now let s get the carne asada nachos going and my diet could be in for some serious problems.   Anyhow  if you are from Cali or the southwest I would definitely recommend you give this truck a try.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,117,Miguel still whips up the most amazing dogs in town  but now there are new options as well  including a quesadillas and a taco menu.  My favorite is the Tacos a La Plancha  grilled  with beans and sizzling cheese on corn tortillas .  Every time people see my order they want to know what it is because it looks as amazing as it tastes.  His location is now in a new trailer food court  partially hidden by a building in the front.  But it s easy access off Burnet Road and there s plenty of parking in the lot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,118,When my wife got pregnant  we looked for a local hotdog joint and was able to find this place on the road while cruising on Burnet.   This place is amazing  every food item is freshly cooked to order and the flavors are incredible. Each time we go we try to get something new.  The owners are incredibly friendly and helpful with any questions on orders.   This is now a regular place we go to when we crave hotdogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,119,Suuuuper delicious everything and speedy  Everything I ve tried I ve loved- I m particularly a huge fan of their strawberry agua fresca  they change them well tho . Will come again and again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,120, 3.5 star    FOOD   I had his Hebrew Hot dog and Carne Asada Burrito. I personally enjoyed the food really much  but was not certain for its price. The quality was mediocre personally  but do know I had these take out. For hot dog  the bun was perfectly toasted and blending of all toppings and its hot dog was incredible. The steak on the burrito was well cooked and could be more juicy than how it was.   ATMOSPHERE   This is one of 12 5000 Burnet Food Truck area.   SERVICE   To be honest  he wasn t going crazy at explaining and stuff as other owners that I visited around the food truck area. I got all my stuff and it was a typical service.  SURROUNDINGS   This is one of 12 5000 Burnet Food Truck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,121,Carnitas French fries are off the hoooook  My boo and I stopped here for lunch and this was the only option that seemed reasonably priced and looked appetizing at the time. We split the fries and a Sonoran hot dog.   Beans on a hot dog  Not my thing but I can see why people would love it. The ladies running the truck were friendly and quick  talk about hustle  Make it a point to stop at this food truck while at 5000 Burnet.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,122,I don t think I ve ever craved a hot dog before  but Jeff M. insisted on starting our Austin eating escapade at T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs  TLSHD . I kind of wish that we didn t start with it  since it s such a tough act to follow.   TLSHD s Sonoran Hot Dog was stupidly good. I saw pictures of the hot dog and thought   ehhh  it looks like a hot dog with relish and mayo. It can t be that good.  I couldn t be more wrong. The  relish  is a jalape o sauce that wasn t very spicy at all  but it added a great amount of flavor. My favorite part of the hot dog was the bun  The dog was served on a bolillo  a type of French bread  that they special order from Arizona every week. It had the slightest bit of crisp but was unbelievably soft on the inside. We tried to get the name of the bakery  but their lips were sealed. The dog also comes with a grilled pepper that s slightly salted and grilled. Delicious   The staff was pretty nice too. They came out and explained what was used in the dog  what made the dog a Sonoran Hot Dog  and they told us the proper way to eat the hot dog  take a bite of the dog  then bite the pepper .  I can t say enough good things about TLSHD  Everything was delicious and it made me want to get another one right away. Get yourself to TLSHD and get yourself one of these glorious dogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,123,These Sonora hot dogs are one of a kind  and once you try them you won t stop craving them   I definitely recommend putting this on your Austin foodie list 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,124,I  can see how a lot of people would miss out on the perfect hot dog by being picky or reluctant to try all of the ingredients. Do yourself a favor and get over it. Try the Sonoran hot dog  con todo.  It s perfect. If we lived in Austin  we would be here on the reg. The other items on the menu looked amazing  especially the steak fries. We tried to go back the next day  but they are closed on Sundays.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,125,This place is always a hit never a miss. From staff friendly and caring attitude to the bomb a   food. My wife and always keep coming back. The Sonora con todo is
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,126,Super friendly service and delicious dogs loaded with toppings. Were very accommodating with masks and mentioned how the buns are shipped in daily from Arizona. Got loaded carne asada fries that were big enough to share and then some. Flavorful and fresh with some great crispness to the fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,127,Fantastic hotdogs and buns  I m not sure how they get them to taste so fresh and light but they re delicious  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,128,THE BEST ESTABLISHMENT IN AUSTIN    The absolute nicest and kindest owners. Your meal is always served with laughs and good stories. I have been coming here for six years and have never had anything but amazing food and good times. Every single thing on their menu is phenomenal. When I get married I ll ask them to cater the wedding and probably perform the service. Seriously  I can t even convey how much I love T-Loc s. You are missing out if you don t eat here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,129,There is definitely something special going on here   I will be honest I have never ever been too excited about hot dogs in my life.  The ones I prefer are generally covered in chili and cheese  but that is not what is going on here at all   This is what I would call hot dog art   What is coming out of this food trailer on burnet is genius     I have mentioned in other reviews before how sometimes simple is perfection - this is the same for Sonora.  The menu is pretty simple - not many items at all - perfection rolling out to turn your world upside down     So here is how it works with the hot dog  - you choose your wiener - regular  premium or veggie  i got premium bc it s national Hebrew and those are the bomb  - and that s it ... you wait   What comes out is a bacon wrapped hot dog sitting in the beautiful fluffy cloud of a bun and all kinds of crazy goodness on top  It s amazing - I promise  Trust me.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,130,The Carne Asada fries are dank  The food was fresh and delicious. For sure going back. Thanks T-Loc 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,131,I was so happy to stop in here tonight. I had recently found out about it and ever since my introduction to the Sonora Dog in my birthplace of Tucson  I was making it a point to stop in sooner than later.   From the moment I walked up to the food truck window I knew I was in the presence of a fellow T-Loc  Tucson Local  with the owner operator  Miguel. Us Tucsonians somehow have a way of finding each other outside our hometown. Miguel was so nice and we talked the entire time he was busily making mad  crazy orders of sonora dog after sonora dog.  I got mine w o onions and yellow mustard and it was just as amazing and delicious as I remember it  I also got the  6 Hebrew National version because I get kosher whenever it s available and because you can really taste that  1 difference   I was also tickled that they had the orange Jarritos  basically the upscale version of a Fanta  and after popping the top I was immediately having flashbacks to my childhood in Tucson and Nogales  AZ.    So thank you  T-Locs for the delectable  nostalgic edible memories  Horale 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,132,BEST HOT DOGS in Austin   The burrito and carne asada fries are the best. Sulma and Mike are so friendly  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,133,The hot dog is so good    Fantastic quality and amazing flavor  I deeply recommend  I got the hot dog with everything  and they make a small one for children.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,134,Literally the nicest and coolest people  They have INCREDIBLE veggie hotdogs. I wake up in the middle of the night and my first thought is their ranch fries. They have special menus for special occasions like  national hotdog day   They always treat me like family. I downloaded the yelp app just so you can all know it s incredible  so go there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,135,Definitely a reason this place has 5 starts and almost 400 reviews.   How good can a hot dog get  This place has set the standard. I was a little hesitant seeing a bacon wrapped hot dog thinking the bacon would be messy. But the bacon is wrapped perfectly around the hot dog where it doesn t get in the way. If the toppings on the hot dog worry you  don t be. The flavors work wonderfully together. And the bun... just perfect.   Agua fresca is a great addition to drink along with it. Don t skip it.  Parking can be a little bit of a hassle on the actual lot  but there are neighboring park lots.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,136,I wore a mask while ordering but when I sat down i had something new on my face... The most amazing burrito I ve ever had. This place is the forking best location for food. Full stop. Period. End of story. Put the cattle in the barn. House slippers comfy comfort food. The flavors  the service  the food are all the best. Don t waste your time anywhere else  The carne asada fries were my favorite. Like walk a mile on hot coals good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,137,Love this place. Amazing service. One of the best burritos in Austin. The hot dog con todo also lives up to the hype.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,138,If you ve ever been to Tucson or the Sonoran region  you know that Sonoran hot dogs are something you can t find anywhere else. Even the bread that is used for these is a specialty  so these guys are making literal magic happen to deliver an authentic Sonoran hot dog all the way in Texas.  If you re asking yourself  how could a hot dog be that good   - check them out for yourself. Once you have one  you ll understand that yes  Sonoran hot dogs really are legendary.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,139,Love the dogs at Yo-Yos in Houston.  Read the reviews and had to try these out.  To say they are special is an understatement.  They have sweet  spicy  sour  and savory all in the same bite.    There is a reason they are too 10 in the US year after year.  Some of the nicest people you will ever meet.   Pony up and enjoy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,140,Always friendly. Always yummy. Always fresh. It s like going to a friends house for a special lunch or dinner in their patio. The carne asada burrito is the best. Especially once they taught me how to use the green sauce and lime 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,141,Great hot dogs. Hands down. Amazing taste. Not Spicey at all Even though it comes with peppers. Recommend peppers. and the papas bravas were the best fries with shrimp anywhere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,142,Best hot dog in Austin tx by far    And don t even mention their Asada Burritos just amazing   5000 Burnet rd go and try it   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,143,This place is a must try  Everything I ve had is amazing. Yaqui dog and ranch fries hit the spot  Definitely recommend you try to go at lunch. Dinner time on a Friday was a bit busy but worth the wait 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,144,Amazing food and people. The hot dogs and burritos de carne asada are the best  Can t go wrong with the fries either.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,145,Anticipation had been building for months. I could not wait another day to finally taste Tone Loc s Funky Hot Sonora dog. I had my parody rap review half written. Then Joe C. had to go all Urban Dictionary on me and ruin the dream by informing me that  T-Loc  in fact stands for  Tuscon Local.  Turns out the adorable proprietors have made it to Austin by way of Arizona.   Okay  fine  but oooh  that bacon-wrapped dog  Such a fresh  pillowy bun. Such tasty toppings  Such a flavorful meat  Such a pleasing texture  crispy where you need it  tender where you don t. And then there s that freshly grilled pepper... Oh my  do not miss the perfection of a bite of the pepper with a mouthful of the dog. Spicy heaven   I m watching my figure  or I certainly would have devoured 2 or 3 of these bad boys. You bet I ll be back. This week. Or tomorrow.

T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,146,Whenever we come to Austin we always search for amazing places with great ratings in advance. With a couple of weeks worth planing this was the first stop for food and boy was it amazing    We got the Carne Asada Fries and the famous con todo hotdog ALLL the way    My girlfriend and I split sense we plan on shoving more food down our goblets. Everything we ate was fresh and authentic.  So the Con Todo comes with  mustard  frijoles  tomatoe  onion  mayo  jalape os and a hotdog wrapped with bacon on a fresh steamed bun.  P.S. It Broke my heart to see people ordering from here and just wanted no jalape os  no mayo  no onions  no mustard and asked for...KETCHUP...people live and try new things. You don t see of find a lot of food trucks that are passionate about what they do.  JUST TRY IT  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,147,I m from Tucson but live in Dallas. This lunch was AMAZING and brought me right back to home. The owners are outstanding people who work very hard to make your experience great 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,148,This hot dog is pretty damn tasty. The bun is perfect too  toasty and fluffy. I m not a big hot dog person but wanted to try it and got it made the way they do it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We got fries as well and a nice mexican coke. The guy is really nice. Try it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,149,I started coming here around Winter 2014. Miguel  the owner  asked me how I found out about the place since they recently moved to Austin to start T-Loc s. I was craving for a good hot dog joint and that led me to their fabulous food truck on Burnet. Miguel s very personable and every time you meet him it seems like old friends reuniting again. This Sonora Hot Dog is my favorite hot dog of all time. Nothing I ve had in the past has compared to this hot dog. Everything on this hot dog fits perfectly together - the combination of flavors from the bacon wrapped dog to the diced tomatoes are amazing. The best part  the bun. My goodness  I wish HEB sold these buns. But apparently Miguel gets the buns shipped from a different region. The burrito is excellent too  I have introduced friends to this food truck and they have raved about it. When you talk about the food culture of Austin  food trucks plays a big role and T-Loc s is one of the best.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,150,To put it briefly  I AM HOOKED     This is the best hot dog I ve ever had. Get it all the way and ask for a Hungarian wax pepper on the side. Also have the carne asada fries they are over the top as well. To top it all off the owners are fantastically fun. Can t wait to come back    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,151,I sometimes feel funny saying this  but I now have a  favorite hot dog place.  I ve never been one to crave hot dogs growing up  but that s likely because I never grew up having a hot dog like the ones Miguel and Zulma serve up at Sonora. Others have described the famous Con Todo hot dog so I won t go into much here  but think of their signature hot dog like a gourmet hot dog with all the works and then some. Miguel is an accomplished chef and he brings that culinary experience and spirit to all of his menu items. Every ingredient on the hot dog is purposeful and is served in just the right quantity. And the bun is to die for. It gets shipped in daily from New Mexico so this is the real deal. Once you ve had the Sonora bun  you ll be wondering why all hot dogs don t get served in a Sonora bun. Trust me    I ve been a customer of theirs for nearly three years now  followed them across three different locations  and I can say the only thing that has changed is the menu now has more offerings  including fries  tacos  simple hot dogs for kids  and quesadillas. Remaining delightfully consistent over the years are the friendly owners behind Sonora  Miguel and Zulma  and the exceptionally consistent quality of their food. My wife and I always enjoy catching up with them  and since the very beginning  they have always treated us like family.  When the weather is nice outside  ask them about their homemade agua fresca. When they do have it  it sells out pretty much every day so get there early and ask for their agua fresca of the day   p.s. We also recommend their asada burrito  And did we mention the hot dog comes with this delicious grilled pepper  Man  sometimes I just crave that perfectly grilled and lightly salted pepper 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,152,A Sonoran hot dog    What is it  I must eat it  Those were the thoughts going through my head as a saw the food truck.   So a Sonoran dog is a hot dog  wrapped in bacon  with beans on it  tomatoes  onion  mustard  ketchup   jalape o sauce - hold the mayo - on a slightly sweet bun imported from Tucson   The dogs are grilled as you order them  amp  the bun is grilled to a nice crisp. It is one amazing dog   This is a must try food truck. You re going to be in hot dog heaven 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,153,I had a pleasant experience ordering here. It was my first time and the owner was super nice. I ordered the Sonora hot dog and it was delicious  I would definitely recommend trying this place if you are on the fence about it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,154,What can be said about this place that has not. Owners are friendly   get to know their customers  the hot dogs are fantastic blend of flavors and buns are spot on. I have eaten here at least a dozen times and the quality never fluctuates  even being someone who does not care for mustard it just works.   Would suggest trying the premium dogs and carne asada tacos    you can do one and one and get a nice plate that will make you want to walk home.   To the review on here complaining about the  hot dog  quality   exactly where have you eaten a Sonora dog off a cart that you questioned the hot dog used...pretty sure I don t want to know most of the times. The trade off here is good quality   good taste   good people and supporting someone that cares about who they are serving.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,155,The first time I heard of a Sonoran style hot dog was some time a few years ago on Man vs. Food. At the time I was skeptical of the combination. Mayo  Beans  Tomatoes  Jalepeno sauce  On a bacon wrapped hot dog  In a bolillo roll  There s absolutely nothing in this dish that resonates with any experience I ve ever had with a hot dog in my life. And now that I ve tried this combination  I can t help but wonder what had I been missing out on for so long.  The bolillo roll is really one of a kind - nothing like you find in any supermarkets here  almost a cross between a bolillo roll and a new england style hot dog bun but it just works. And when I saw that the regular hot dogs here were the Bar-S type  I was like eh but its salty punch helps balance out the rest of the flavors. I can t quite put my hand on it  but everything just works together so well in a soft but crisp roll. Despite that long list on condiments above  the condiments play a complementary role and don t overwhelm it. I can see why this place gets rave reviews.  That said  not sure I d pay  5 for the hot dog  I d think the Hebrew national would come default at that price but w e   since for most people I d feel they d need at least 2 to get full. Owner is super nice talkative guy too  Will come back to try out that carne asada and the burrito...and maybe another hot dog if I got change to spare.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,156,I ve eaten a lot of hot dogs. I m a self proclaimed hot dog connoisseur  with home grown NYC experience to back me up. Onto my review   I purchased the premium Sonara Hot Dog. This comes with a Hebrew National Frank instead of Bar S for  6. I was a little disappointed that it wasn t a longer size than your standard dog for the price  however the ingredients does make up  for it. The Sonara Hot Dog comes with bacon wrapped with onions  mayo mustard  chopped tomatoes  grilled onions  I got mine without these   jalapeno sauce  and beans. The ingredients meshed together really well taste-wise. You would need two to be truly satisfied given it s a regular sized hot dog. The bread was your plain ole Jane it was very tasty. I think the buns are a special order.   I won t be in a rush to come back here however  because I like the variety of Man  Bites Dog or Frank and I think you gret more bang for your buck in this price range however  you can t go wrong experiencing Sonara Hot Dog. The owner was very personable and he seem to have a good rapport with his clients. Sonara Hot Dogs does offer a couple of other items like a quesadilla and a burrito  but I kept it classic with what I believe it s known for.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,157,There was a time in the summer where I was obsessed with hot dogs. I ate a hot dog every day. I decided to try out this hot dog truck that everyone has been craving about. When I looked into it I was like wait  it has beans in it   Sounds interesting  I have to try it. My friend is quite the picky eater and was scared about all of the toppings on the hot dog  but she had to try the original one. The man that ran the truck was very accommodating and friendly. He suggested putting a tiny half line of mustard on her dog because she hates mustard. Turns out  the hype was real. Everything went together surprisingly well. The grilled pepper that came with it gave it a kick. It was pretty spicy though  not going to lie. I wish I could eat 5 of these  but I am at a point in my life where a  2 pack of hot dogs is all I can afford right now.  collegeprobs but hot dogs 4 lyfe
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,158,I ve been coming here for about 5 years and it s never disappointed me. Hard to imagine holding the same standard for such a long time  Hands down the best hot dog I ve ever had. I ll always seek you out and will drive hours to come see you  Keep it up buddy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,159,One of the many reasons I love Austin. This foodtruck is known for their amazing hot dogs  best in Texas for sure   but they also have the most yummiest  most perfect burritos.  The steak  the beans  the cheese  the tortilla...everything is perfect and magical. My boyfriend and I come here on average at least once a week.   A great ambiance too...a few other food trucks on the lot. Pretty clean area  a place for kids to play while you sit and enjoy either the best hot dog or best burrito in Austin . This used to be the only food truck on the lot...and now there are many after realizing it s perfect location.  Can t wait to have it again later this week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,160,Amazing Sonoran Dogs and Carne Asada from Tucson  Arizona. Very hard to find this type of food in Austin. Heads up the tortillas and hot dogs are much different than you normally see in town  which is awesome.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,161,They have the Best Vegan Dog EVER  Sweet bun  mayo  tomatoes  beans  hot sauce.  Wow.  My friends and I dream about these dogs often.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,162,I hadn t had a Sonoran hot dog in 4 years din r my last trip to Tucson. Upon arriving Miguel welcomed me and let me know these are authentic. The buns are flown in from Tucson and T-Locs actually stands for Tucson Locals. I fell in love with this dog again after first bite. I can t wait to visit again in October.

T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,163,Awesome. New way to eat a dog. The toppings and the bread are the stars of this show. The roasted   salted pepper on the side takes it over the top.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,164,I saw a review for T-Loc s in a Yelp email for National Hot Dog Month. I worked for a while in the Tucson area and was familiar with the Mexican style hot dogs T-Loc s is famous for. I just happened to be in the neighborhood so I stopped by to check  em out. Without any reservations  i have to say that Miguel and his partner have not only nailed it  but exceeded the flavor I held in my memory. They were so friendly and informative  talking about their struggles and successes and the love of what they re doing. I am absolutely rooting for team T-Loc    I went for the best  Their Sonora Dog Con Todo with a Lemonade Ginger Agua Fresca. Everything was exceptional. The bun is like no other and  while slightly crispy on the outside  literally melts in your mouth. I have no idea what kind of bread it is or the dough used  but it is almost like a sopapilla on the inside. They ship in the rolls because he can t find anyone to make it locally to his specifications. The layering of flavorful ingredients and sauces over a perfectly grilled bacon-wrapped hot dog still has my mouth watering. I advise getting it just the way they offer it - with everything - that s what sets it above the rest. I ll be back on a regular basis and  who knows  I might even try the rest of the menu offerings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,165,Perfection  The most unique hot dog I have ever had. The bread is brought in weekly and yummy. A perfect balance of flavors.  I m not much a a burrito fan normally but loved it  Very cute clean outdoor setting and prime location.  You can tell the pride and love that the owners chefs put into making the dining experience excellent. Can t wait to go back and sample more of the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,166,If you like hot dogs  there is no better place than This place  so unique and so delicious  You need to come.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,167,Hot dogs were great and very filling  My husband got the burrito with egg and loved it  was also a good size   Our girls got the asada fries and for picky eaters they also loved them.Great atmosphere as well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,168,First time here and this place was the bomb diggity       Had a hard time picking what to get only because everything seemed so good and couldn t decide. Decided to go with the carne asada fries and Sonoran Style Hot Dog. They had ran out the Mexican cream for fries but still decided to get without it and they were delicious. The Mexican cream is will be like an entry to heaven. Will definitely be coming back many more times  but with the intent of getting to hot dogs instead of one. Good find  great food
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,169,Let me just start off by saying I am a Tucson  T-Loc  native. This is the real thing. It does exist  fellow T Locs. Miguel  aka Mike  the owner  flies in the bolillo buns FROM TUCSON via fed ex. This is a big deal for anyone who doesn t understand how important the bolillo bun is to the Sonoran hot dog. If you haven t had a Sonoran hot dog yet let me make your mouth water...  You start off with a warm  toasty bolillo bun  has a hint of sweetness to it vs regular buns and is closed on the ends to hold all the goodies . Then you grill a hot dog with bacon ON A FLAT TOP GRILL. Yes people...on. A. Flat. Top. Grill. This is key and Miguel does this. You just have to go there to have him describe in sensual foodie detail the amazingness that is the glorious Sonoran hot dog.   BUT WAIT THERE S MORE     He makes the most legit carne Asada burritos and quesadillas too and they re freakin AWESOME. If I wasn t on a strict meal plan and only given one cheat meal a week I would be here every day. EVERY. DAY.   I haven t even mentioned the fact that the customer service here is way above and beyond. He and his lady Zulma  I think that s her name  are really friendly  and  amable . They recently took a quick drive to Tucson to buy supplies and he even asked if there was anything he could pick up for me. Whaaaaaat  I declined but today he gave me a small pack of some delicious tortillas. Amazing.   This place is also BYOB as of 2 2016 soooo bring some Modelo and lime and get ready to experience that which is Sonoran style food euphoria.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,170,T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs are amazing  It will change your life  Before trying their hot dogs  I didn t like anything if it wasn t a plane hot dog with ketchup and mayo  the end.. no more and no less . My hot dog tastes were extremely black and white. I surprised myself since it is unlike me but I love their sonoran hot dogs. Be open minded if you are a picky hot dog eater like me since it has a lot of ingredients  but all the different ingredients play together so well. To me it s not a hot dog  it is a flavor experience  And don t ignore the lightly grilled and salted pepper that comes with it  it greatly adds to the experience  I ve tried their other menu items as well and they are all delicious but the hot dog will always be my favorite because I can t get anything like it elsewhere.  Also  the owners are very friendly and always a treat to see  I am impressed that Miguel recognizes me every time I come by even after just 1 visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,171,Hotdogs and burritos  My... least expected combination of amazing food. It doesn t matter. It s 2015 and Miley Cyrus told me us we could do whatever we want.  The dude behind all this creation gave me to opportunity to eat the premium hotdog and the carne asada burrito. In exchange for some money.   Hot dogs  the regular is  5 and is not all beef. The premium is  6 and is all beef. Both hotdogs come with bacon. Yes  it sounds like a car wash but I assure you that it tastes much better. There are so many flavors in this hot dog that I wanted to get a second one before I was even done eating.   Burrito  the owner knows the real deal. No rice to fill you up with such nonsense. This burrito is just as flavorful and is out of the world.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,172,Being from Arizona and there being no carne asada out here  it was a little upsetting  until we found this food truck. Even though he is a U of lAme fan  his food was just perfect. The tortilla was fresh  my picky son LOVED his quesadilla  and the carne asada taco was perfectly cooked and seasoned   We will definitely be coming back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,173,I haven t tried anything else besides the con todo aka with everything hot dogs but they are  definitely the bomb    I have lived in El Paso Texas half my life and frequently when to Juarez to have a hot dog made this way and when I moved  to Austin I really didn t find a place that made them like home but this place is pretty close and now that I know it s here I ll be back for more. Definitely stop by and try this place great lil spot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,174,If your are from Southern California and have been on the hunt for San Diego mexican food then you found the right place for Carne asada burritos and fries  Super nice people and great carne asada.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,175,Short weekend trip from Houston and my cousin said I had to try out these hot dogs.  They have the best hot dogs ever.  Not too salty and the buns are amazing.  The toppings all come together well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,176,I Person I know took me overt there and I really like the hotdog even when I m not a fast food person .. I will recommend this place to all of you but the best part are the owner .. super friendly people and you can talk long enough with them .. and they are well know  travel
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,177,If I could give this review more than 5 Stars I would. The people that run this Food Truck are extremely friendly and accommodating and genuinely enjoy what they are doing and have a passion for the food that they provide.   I have never had a Hot Dog come close to what I had here and my one regret of moving to Houston was not being able to eat here as often as I d like. 110  Satisfaction with the Service and Food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,178,Mystified by all these 5 star reviews  which just goes to show that people in Austin will pay almost anything for a food item they are not familiar with. It s a hot dog with just more toppings than normal. Place uses the cheapest wieners  Bar-X  then charge you  6 bucks for the thing. Want to  upgrade  Hebrew National-style   7 is the entrance fee... still a single hotdog. Taste is OK but nothing compared to being in Tucson where one can pound these all the live long day for  2.75   pop   Flying in the buns daily from Tucson  Gimmick which sounds uber retarded  as Arizona water is even worse for breadstuffs than here in Texas. Maybe these dudes are  6 because the FedEx fees are wrapped into the amount   Inside crammed food truck court with crappy parking. Good luck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,179,I m not even sure how to write this review because all of the words i can think of to describe how good a Sonora Dog is  just seem to be completely and utterly inadequate. This hot dog stand is so  so  so  so AMAZING   I am totally in love with Sonora Hot Dogs   Highlights   -This is a food truck with a hot dog mission.  There aren t your average hot dogs  there are Sonora Dogs which means it it a bacon wrapped  grilled hot dog  on top of pinto beans  on a speciality made hot dog bun shipped in from Tucson  smothered in pico de gallo  onions  mayo  mustard  jalape o sauce  and served with a grilled chile on the side.  And in a word  it is DELICIOUS   -For non-hot dog people  there are also fantastic carne asada burritos and quesadillas.  I can t speak for the burrito  but the carne asada quesadilla was super tasty in its cheesy goodness  You can also order just a plain quesadilla as well.  -So  you re a vegetarian  You are in luck  They also have vegan hot dogs with veganaise.    -Mexican sodas and aqua frescos are also available to complete your meal here.  yummy   If you haven t tried Sonora Hot Dogs yet  get over here ASAP and stuff your lovely face   On a side note  they do offer Hebrew National hot dogs as the upgraded hot dog option.  This is a superior hot dog for all intents and purposes and I love them. However  as the upgraded option  it includes the hot dog to be wrapped in bacon.  This is amazing for me on all levels  but can be disappointing to others.   Why you ask   Well  we had some kosher people in our group.  I had told them that they also served Hebrew National hot dogs  so they could get some dogs too.  I hadn t been before  so i didn t know about the bacon.  I guess all of the kosher Hebrew National hot dogs are wrapped in bacon as part of the prep process.  So we had a couple people who couldn t try the dogs for kosher reasons.  I would suggest maybe keep a couple kosher dogs kosher.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,180,Excellent hot dogs  super friendly service. These things are expertly crafted and you can tell they take pride in their work. Haven t seen another Sonoran dog anywhere else in town  so I was excited about this place. Should have more umbrellas as eating in the sun isn t great and I m too much of a mess to eat these in the car.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,181,Tucson flair   Fly in their hot dog buns from Tucson  and their hotdogs are fabulous.  Their Ranch Fries are to die for   Thanks for making Austin your home and sharing all your greatness with us 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,182,I wish hot dogs were good for you  because I would like to eat most if not all of my meals at this place. Just WOW 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,183,I m from Tucson AZ. I love living in Austin but get homesick for the Mexican food I know and love and let me tell you  the first time I ate at T-Locs I had happy tears in my eyes. Sonoran hot dogs  caramelos  carne asada fries  and burritos are all so delicious and authentic to the area. Can t say enough about it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,184,This place was amaze balls. My husband has been craving a hot dog and the Sonora hot dogs hit the spot   We also had the carne asada fries that were beyond our expectations  Definitely coming back and trying other items on the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,185,The burrito is even better    How is this possible    My friend ate a Con Todo  bacon wrapped hot dog w  fixings and beans  while we were there and was so enamored she ordered another to-go. Shhh    You know who you are...  If you haven t tried this food truck across from Allendale HEB  go ASAP. You won t be disappointed.  And don t forget- those aguas frescas are not only refreshing  but they also make a perfect base for your favorite pool beverage 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,186,We ordered a little bit of everything the service was amazing and so was the food u guys are doing an amazing job    Sincerely    The Craft burger food truck couple 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,187,The best example of what a food truck should be  friendly and fast service  short menu with a focus on perfecting a few items  and the occasional long line proving how good the food is.   Do you know what makes a  Sonoran-style hot dog Sonoran  I didn t until I visited for my first time. Like everyone else has said  the bacon-wrapped dog with fresh  southwestern  toppings is stand-out  but it s not the reason I ll be returning again and again.   I ll be returning again and again for   the carne asada burrito and the quesadilla. Both are at the top of their class in terms of quality of ingredients and attention to construction. Yes  that s right  a burrito has to be constructed in just the right way as to ensure a series of  perfect bites  and to guarantee  as much as you can  preventing the dreaded  explosion --non-bite end of burrito opening up  causing the filing to escape. This burrito is one where you ll want to chew slowly as to savor  as much as you possibly can  the tenderness of the beef  the freshness of the avocado  and the genuine perfection resulting from an ideal combination of ingredients.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,188,No one is happier than me finding this place  I used to eat Sonoran dogs in Phoenix and hadn t had one in about 5 years until yesterday  I was looking on yelp for lunch and this popped up. I headed over and found the owner and his wife in the food truck. They were awesome to chat with  I excitedly told them about my previous experience with these types of hotdogs and turns out they came out here from Arizona just to do this type of food  Man  am I happy  I work close by and told them I d be seeing them often  The food was delicious and an even better rendition of the Sonoran dogs I had in Phoenix. Order it just the way they suggest it. You won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,189,Miguel was amazing     Everything was delicious     The flavors melt in your mouth  I am so happy that we found this place  Am I coming back  Yes I will           
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,190,I went here the other day and my god you can get a large fajita like thing for only a few dollars from here burning hot from the oven whenever you get there. Also their hot dogs are to die for and must be tried at least once from any casual austinite. They re so good and the ppl at the counter are extremely nice. Today I went there and the lady said I didn t need to tip them. Like for real  Nobody ever denies a tip. But I can at least tip them with this well deserved review. Give them a try if you re in the area.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,191,I finally got to try the famous hot dog after months of trying to make it there when they re open and I have to say I was not disappointed  it was definitely an interesting mix but would for sure go back again for another. Left me completely satisfied and full
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,192,This guys does it RIGHT    Yes the hot dog  Sonora  was really good. Cooked just rights  super soft bun with good ingredients and time taken to prepare. But what REALLY had me going was the  carne asada burrito  This thing ROCKS  just beef  Avocado and cheese. No rice  no beans or filler of any kind.   He even came out to talk to us about how he prepares and it was obvious he takes pride in what he s doing. I will be back for my burrito fix for sure and the sauces were home made as well. The red one does have some bite but not as much as I expected based on reviews.  Pros  Cool location  umbrellas  nice breeze. Good food and great people running it.  Cons  I shouldn t be eating a hot dog AND a burrito in one sitting but after trying my partners burrito  I HAD to  Dammit that means extra time on the treadmill this week. Worth it.   Tucson Locals - you got my vote  T-Loc s .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,193,Gosh damn. The best hot dog I ve ever had in my life. The fluffy bun. The perfectly cooked premium hot dog. All the perfectly portioned and distributed toppings. GOSH DAMN. Absolutely worth the  6.50. The roasted pepper is delicious too  Goes great with the hot dog.  Service was great too  it s pretty cold outside  so you can wait in the car and he ll bring your order to you  He s also a pretty nice dude   I d definitely come back for more  5 5.  Update  Just tried the Carne Asada burrito  very good  but the hot dog is definitely where it s at. Only complaint would be that it s smaller than what you d think for the price.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,194,One of the best hot dogs I have ever had  made to order and always hot and fresh  Fresh ingredients and great customer service. Not to mention they are located and a very cool relaxed location.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,195,I used to think mission dogs was pretty good but then found out about this awesome trailer   The couple that run this stand are out of this world personable and the food does not disappoint  The hot dog buns are shipped from an AZ bakery   The crema and beans with a charred pepper are unique and delicious.  Their cheese taco is also killer with some pickled onion.  I ve tried their Tortas too and only Dos Batos can compare.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,196,Great food and great people.  the sonoran hotdog and carne asada plate is my favorite. Will definitely come back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,197,The Facebook photos were enough to make me take on rush hour traffic for a hotdog. Totally worth the 1.5 hours it took to go 5 miles.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,198,Usually when I think hot dog I think disappointing and not very good. What they did with hot dog is on a whole other level this place is awesome. And my girlfriend found the taco she couldn t find anywhere else in Austin that she loves
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,199,The best hotdogs and quesadillas in Austin  no joke. The tacos are something else  also. It s all good and the couple that own the place are awesome. Eat here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,200,Super friendly services  the boss explained me throughly on some of the top sellers.  Items selected  hot dog all the way  without beans   steak burrito. It s about average  nothing stood out for a  5 hot dog. The bread was different  but the hot dog tasted like  3 a dozen pack from Walmart.  Steak burrito was very filling. Lots of steak  it was good for two people.   The place is a bit hidden  it s behind the buildings in a food trucks court. Plenty of parkings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,201,It s awesome  The best hot hogs in the whole state  I come every time I m in town from Houston  And of course the customer service is the best  And love the Atmosphere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,202,Awe finally  Coming from Arizona  I missed those Sonoran hot dogs. They are just simple hotdogs loaded with lots of goodies like beans  bacon  and the sauces lol...but they taste great  I used to love going to those guys pushing the little carts and ordering these hotdogs in AZ.  Well  we finally have one in Austin. I was actually searching for one last December but there weren t any. These guys just moved here about six months ago from Tucson AZ. So these are the real thing...  So  for all you AZ and Southwest transplants...we have Sonoran hotdogs...I just had my first two...lol   Thanks for listening...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,203,Oh man  the time that it took me to eat this passed by way too quickly   I kid you not as I was driving away it felt like a dream that never really happened.  I had to stop myself from turning around to get another one just to prove that it happened   I was a little worried about parking as with any food trailer park but  I easily found I spot in their tiny parking lot.  The food park is quaint and fenced in with 3 large picnic tables.  I walked up to the window and the nice lady  owner  explained to me how they do the hot dogs and I ordered it the way they do it and purchased a pineapple water  2.00  the flavor of the week    I opted to pay  6.00 for a Hebrew National hot dog as opposed to the  5.00 one.  They also have other menu items so it isn t just hot dogs   I am going to try to remember all the toppings here   hot dog wrapped in bacon  tomatoes  onions  beans  mayo  mustard  jalapeno sauce....darn I think I am missing one or two   I sat down and waited for my food and thoroughly enjoyed that pineapple water  so much that I probably could have drank a liter by myself.  The fruit was freshly squeezed and you could tell they made it themselves.  Also  enjoyed that they gave you a glass filled to the brim with ice which was nice and refreshing   The man  other owner  brought me out my hot dog and of course I took the obligatory picture   The flavors were so  good  this is the part where I start dreaming  I couldn t help but  take bite after bite.  I was done in a matter of 2 minutes and I could probably win some hot dog eating contest if these were involved.  The toppings were nice and diced and everything was well balanced in the way of flavor   Nothing was too overpowering  sweet  spicy and the beans really gave it something extra   I am normally not someone who lets people put tomatoes or mayo on a hot dog but  you won t be disappointed if you get it the way it comes   I also enjoyed the grilled pepper that it came with but  beware it is hot   The bun was also great and I loved the way it hugged the hot dog and the toppings the whole way through.  This way you don t end up with a mess all over you   I am glad this place is right around the corner from where I live but  that also makes me want to cry because I will keep eating it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,204,Wow is all I can say  Best hot dog I have ever had in my life. Seriously. Chef is an amazing guy. Really cares about what he serves. What a surprise. Come and have your taste buds blown away 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,205,I got to go back here again   The sonora hot dog was something special. Super unique and tasted amazing. The carne asada burrito...was so so good. I need to go back for this specific menu item.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,206,If you want to eat something that s gonna change your life you ve come to the right place. Order the hot dog con todo with an order of ranch fries  You can never go wrong with T Locs. The owners are super friendly and the food is so delicious you ll definitely be coming back for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,207,Fantastic hot dogs    I brought my husband here after seeing decent reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed. This place is a food truck  nestled just off Burnett next to two other food trucks. The owner is an awesomely nice guy who we talked with briefly while placing our orders. My husband got two premium dogs  and I got a regular dog sans the jalapeno sauce.  Honestly  I didn t think I d like everything on the dogs but I really wanted the authentic experience so I went with the flow  and I m glad that I did. All of the ingredients were very fresh and it all tasted great  even together. Kudos - we ll be back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,208,After a day of errand-running  my husband and I stopped by to pick-up a quick dinner. I had originally dismissed the trailer  parked across Burnet from the Allandale HEB  because it looked more like a slick state fair truck than the purveyor of deliciousness and hospitality that it is. Fortunately  I had noticed some Yelp love and made a mental note to check it out.  We munched our way through the premium hot dog  con todo   i.e.  beans  jalapeno sauce  mustard  mayo  diced tomato  and caramelized onions   oohing over the steamed bun  I know some find it soggy  but I loved it  and ahhing over the bacon-wrapped dog with all of the fixings. We also tried the carne asada burrito  which was equally flavorful  filled with nicely seasoned meat and mashed avocado  served with red and green salsas to your liking. You really can t go wrong with either savory pick  but I recommend going with a friend who likes sharing food so that you can sample both.  The service is so friendly. You just have to love a couple who made their dream a reality and somehow manages to work in very close quarters with smiles on their faces. I also appreciate Miguel s pride in his food - he made sure to show us our  to go  hot dog before bagging it so we could see how perfectly dressed it was in case it got mucked up on the drive home. Sonora s excellence really is in the details.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,209,I m in a great mood today. Let me share with you how I really think. I ll keep this short   I pretty much see food for its nutritional value  and no matter how beautifully crafted  seasoned  or presented it is  at the end of the day it s in one hole and out the other. Consume too many empty calories and you get fat. Sorry  we can t defy the laws of physics.  So when you re reading my Yelp reviews  and I m blathering how some place is so wonderful or whatever  keep in mind it s less about the food and more about the experience  Am I feeling welcomed  Am I having a great time  Do I enjoy being here  And if you text me with  Let s go there tomorrow  would I respond   Cya there   If you know me in real life  you know I m usually pretty easy.  So here s what I really think about Sonora Hot Dogs  It s a couple working a trailer living their dream. There is absolutely nothing I admire more than people who are so passionate and excited about what they re doing you can actually feel it. Do I really care about a hot dog or burrito  No. Would I go out of my way to come here for a hot dog or burrito  You bet. It s one small step for me  but one giant leap in my World of Mankind. Anything is as good as you want it to be. Everyone should be living their dream. An easy five stars from me.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,210,We really liked this place when we went for the first time on Wednesday afternoon before dropping off one of our moms at that airport  she wanted to go to a food truck for her last meal in Austin  so we took her to this park by our house and she picked the place .  We had never heard of T-Loc s before  but it must be some big thing in Tucson. We got two hot dogs  one Hebrew National and one veg  and all shared the buttermilk ranch fries. The buns were better than the typical cardboard stuff you get  they re allegedly FedExed in  and there was a good amount of toppings. The fries were seriously delicious--and they give you a massive amount. The moms enjoyed her torta.  Service was friendly and quick  and prices seemed on point with what you got. Overall  a big hit with the family and we d be happy to recommend it and go back again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,211,What makes a place five stars   It s not rocket science.  Generally  if I can t wait to tell the wife about it  crave it days later and need to return  and can t think of anything I would change there...  The embarrassing reality   When my wife wanted to stop at a clothing sale on Burnet last Saturday  just south of 2222 Koenig  I was initially sad that I couldn t find a parking spot  so I dropped her off at the door.  Then I made  lemon aguas frescas  out of those lemons by determining that I could get to Sonora Hot Dogs  and slam down a delightful dog before the wife even noticed I was gone     And folks say I lack vision...  Michael and his lovely wife   I wish I was better with names   who own the T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dog trailer  came to Austin via Tucson  AZ  near the Mexico border state of Sonora.  Hermosillo  Sonora  is where the sublime goodness of the bacon-wrapped dog was invented.  To keep things as authentic as possible  they even source their bread from Tucson.  And when he describes his hunt for just the right jalapeno  a white jalape o   his passion shows.  And you can t find more friendly service.    Every bite of the hot dog  with it s mayo and mustardy  jalape o-sauced  onion and tomatoey goodness  is eye-rollingly good.  And don t forget the beans which give it a unique edge as well.  When I described my poor gluten-free wife s inability to enjoy a hot dog in a bun  or a burrito in a flour tortilla  he said to  just bring her by .  On a cloud-cooled evening  we decided it would be a good time for a little roadside dining.  Even though I d only met him once almost two weeks before  as soon as we walked up Michael said he d be more than happy to throw together a couple not-exactly-on-the-menu tacos from the also very yummy burrito ingredients  paired with some corn tortillas he just happened to have handy.    Great food Cheap prices Local and friendly ownership Thirst-quenching aguas frescas and horchata Easy parking  What more could I ask for   Ok  maybe air conditioning.      4.998 stars.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,212,Just like they do it in Tucson but right here in Austin. Quality ingredients  quality people  quality food. So solid 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,213,Best Sonora dogs in Texas hands down. The bread is brought over from Mexico  and let me tell you it really makes this place stand out from any run of the mill hot dog spot. A Sonora starts at 6 bucks with the fixings and definitely a bang for your buck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,214,Carne asada taco  chuco taco  and Sonoran style hot dog are all phe-nom-enal    If you want authentic style Mexican look no further. This is as good as it gets y all. I will dream of this taco until I have it again. Remember the carne asada taco won the 2019 Austin National Taco Championship 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,215,Excellent tacos  The carne asada tacos were on point  The chuco tacos were amazing  Get off of your butt and go try this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,216,Got the fish tacos which is currently a special please please make them permanent  I m not going to lie I ve lived a good chunk of my life in California which is fish taco land and so I went in super skeptical but they were delicious   Also love the little side garnish of pickled veggies it made me feel like I was back in San Diego  The people who run the truck are super sweet and clearly care a lot about their food and their customers I will definitely be coming back to try to the whole menu. Also helped my friend devour his carne asada fries which were so good it was hard to be polite and only eat a few.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,217,I first had my first taste of a Sonoran Hotdog in Tucson  when I lived in AZ.  One bite and there s no going back. And no other hotdog will ever come close.  Street food at its finest and legend has it that it originated in Sonora in the 80 s. You could only find them in Tucson and in some areas of Southern Arizona...that is until now.... We stumbled upon T Locs when we were driving around in Austin  Texas.  I almost fainted when I spotted the sign.  This little food truck is LEGIT.  They have their Bolillo bread Fedexed everyday from Tucson for their particular  dog .   Yes  they also have tasty burritos and tortas but why would you not order their famous Sonoran Hotdog   I live for them   I dream of them   I obsess about them   I count them in my sleep   And Mike the owner remembered me from 2 years ago.  Yes  I was that crazy lunatic woman that inhaled 3 in one sitting all the while moaning like Andrew Zimmern after each bite.  Now about that GLORIOUS hot dog   Nope  not just any ole hotdog but one wrapped in succulent crispy bacon.  Oh yeah   Piled high with pinto beans  tomatoes  green salsa  jalape o  mustard  mayonnaise  avocado and cotija cheese on top.  TRUST ME   Try one.  You ll think you ve died and gone to heaven   I thought I did.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,218,Finally got the chance to get to this place. These hot dogs are amazing. Sonoran style and you have to try the ranch fries  amazing. I was really impressed. We ll be back for sure.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,219,At first I didn t want to try the Mexican hotdog but then Miguel told me just to try it  The hotdog was so good the combination of the toasted bun the beans the bacon it was the best hotdog I ve ever had I ve definitely go back
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,220,Miguel  Zulma and Mom are amazing. I ve been having these hotdogs for a few years now  never gets and never disappoint. Amazing people serving amazing food. Not only are they super kind but they remember who you are. Love them and will continue to come every Saturday.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,221,This food truck is absolutely amazing in every way possible.   From the moment I stepped up to place my order  I was greeted with a friendly  smiling face. The menu is simple  hot dogs  burritos  and quesadillas.On my first visit  last week   I ordered the carne asada burrito which included delicious and perfectly cooked beef  avocado  and pico de gallo. It came with a lime half  as well as salsa roja and salsa verde  both of which were fresh and tasty. The couple that own the business were extremely outgoing and friendly  asking me how I heard of them and explaining to me that they packed up and moved from Tuscon  AZ to start this new adventure here in Austin. They were genuinely pleased and grateful that I came to try their food.   After I ordered food  I saw that they offered aguas frescas  which I has never tried but knew my coworker loved  so I ordered one to bring to my friend. They have different flavors every week  and that week it was watermelon. As soon as she tasted it  she told me how incredible and authentic it was and insisted I try it. IT WAS HEAVENLY..crisp  sweet watermelon flavor with fresh sliced mint leaves. I could have kicked myself for not ordering one for myself  but swore I would get one next time.   Fast forward to to today  when I returned for yet another carne asada burrito  I swear I ll try the hot dog and quesadilla soon  . The burrito was delightful and satisfying as usual  and was enough to completely fill me up. I was surprised that the owners remembered me from my visit a week ago. I was greeted with a friendly   Hi  welcome back  What will you be trying today   I ordered the burrito because  dammit  I was craving it  The aguas frescas flavor of the week was mango  and even though I LOVE mango  I said I d pass and get it again when they had watermelon. They were so incredibly nice that they gave me a sample cup  very decent size  of the mango to try it anyway. It was delectable and I would certainly order it again.   They were thankful for my return visit and shining with delight that I has enjoyed their food so much. I couldn t find anything bad to say about the owners or the food if I tried. I m so glad I found this place  will certainly recommend it to everyone I know  and plan to return again with regularity. Thanks Sonora  Y all are great  and welcome to Texas 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,222,Amazing food. You got to get the premium dog and the cheese fries. Best fries I ve ever had in my life.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,223,The hot dogs are great. I had to have a second one. But the burrito is awesome. Tons of carne asada  great homemade tortillas  pico  and guacamole. Served with half a lime and salsa roja or verde. Just the right amount of heat.  This Mexican girl is happy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,224,Incredible place. Incredible Food. Incredible Owners. It s no accident this place is so highly rated.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,225,If you re already on here just stop reading and go.   Get the hot dog  con todo . You won t regret it. They ship their buns tortillas from Tucson - where the Sonora hot dogs originate. This is a serious stuff  guys.   Oh and their limonada compliments it perfectly.   Enjoy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,226,Legit AZ style carne asada. No frills  carne asada with smashed avocado and pico in a delicious tortilla. They get their tortillas and hot dog buns from Tucson  This place was worthy of taking the 5 minutes to write a review. You want good  legit  traditional AZ carne asada in ATX  this is the only place you can find it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,227,I really love this place  my favorite hot dog ever.  My wife always love the chiles g eros toreados that come with the food. Mike and his wife are super friendly. We will always come back to this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,228,A must go to destination in Austin.  Food is so amazing.  Gourmet dishes from a small little food truck.  The folks here truly put love into each dish they prepare.  If you can only choose one food truck to go to in Austin I highly recommend this one.  This establishment has been approved by the BIG KAHUNA.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,229,Finally passed by and noticed they were open  it appears this is week five of their opening. Super nice couple who are offering Austin the only actual Sonoran hot dog. I think there have been a few tries but never the real deal until now.  They offer a regular  premium and veggie dogs. Also a couple of burritos. So I ve tried the hot dog with everything. A Sonoran dog is wrapped in bacon  topped with beans  grilled onions  fresh onions  tomatoes  mayonnaise  cream sauce  mustard and jalapeno sauce with a roasted pepper. Mmm......bacon   The carne asada burrito with avocado was also just as good. I ll have to rotate what I get in the future. I was given a small tasting of an aqua fresca which they also have. She said melon  I was thinking specifically cantaloupe.    As of Tuesday  May 13th the new hours will be Tue-Sat 11a-10p. Closed Sunday and Mondays. This will make it easier to get a fix.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,230,Fantastic food and folks  My wife and I come here whenever we re in this part of town. The food is fresh and delicious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,231,I m going to be honest  my boyfriend and I were hesitant at first about trying this place out. We had the passbook and we were wondering if hot dogs were really going to fill us up  we re also not huge fans of what is usually considered mystery meat . We went to their website and saw their video  it convinced us to try it. We were so glad we did.  Their hot dogs rise above the stigma. They look beautiful  are packed with toppings  and are totally scrumptious. The special bread they use only elevates it s delciousness. We were impressed. Also the owners were so nice  You could tell they are passionate about what they do. They ship the bread from Arizona  but they plan to go there and learn how to make it themselves. They were also shocked about their high ratings online  They deserve it. Great Service. Great Food.  We got cups of their freshly made pineapple fresca. Oh my gosh  I wish I could have it everyday. We also ordered a burrito. It was packed with deliciously seasoned juicy meat. It s safe to say I love this food truck. I hope it sticks around for a while.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,232,The truck was a little difficult to find but it s worth it once you do. I had the Sonora hot dog and my partner had the Carne Asada and that was good as well. Very well seasoned. I would advise anyone to at least try it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,233,My wife and I were doing some shopping in the area and decided we were hungry. She looked on Yelp and said   there s a hotdog place close to hear that s supposed to be good.  I m not one to typically jump at the opportunity for a hotdog  but I like to try new things so I agreed. We went to Sonora hot dogs at an off time in the afternoon  so it wasn t busy at all. We were greeted by the friendly owner  can t remember his name . He chatted with us for a while as he prepared our food. We split the Sonora hot dog and the Carne Asada burrito. I was blown away by the hot dog. Every ingredient is extremely high quality which resulted in a perfect blend of flavor. The bun was the best bun I ve ever tasted  which sets up the flavor for the entire hotdog.  We ve gone back a second time and our looking forward to our next return. Give Sonora Hot Dogs a try and you ll be back for many more visits 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,234,My wife and I are from Phoenix so we know what a good Sonoran Hotdog is supposed to taste like and T-Loc s dogs are even better. Definitely the real deal. The owner and his wife are wonderful people and always the best hosts.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,235,I went for the the hotdog. It is awesome  wonderful flavor without being overwhelming  as much as I like Chicago style dogs  they can be a bit much . Served on a soft gourmet bun and with a perfectly grilled spicy pepper  If you are there for the hotdog  that is what it is  just one style of hotdog. If you are looking for a variety of toppings and styles  this wouldn t be the place. But that one dog  it is wonderful.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,236,This place has the best hotdogs you ll ever eat and the carne asada fries are really good as well. The guy who cooks the food is really nice and you can tell he cares about the food he serves just by tasting it. If in Austin you should really go try them out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,237,This place is amazing  Had the Con Todo and it was the best hot dog I ve ever eaten  The Ranch Fries were also great. Go to this trailer now 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,238,This place is fantastic  I am a vegan and Miguel was super accommodating. They were out of the veggie hot dogs and he instead made us a bean burrito and two vegan cheese tacos  which would have been much more expensive than one hot dog. He even took extra time to create a cute presentation on our plates. The food was amazing and came out very quickly. Miguel is incredibly kind and is very attentive and fun to chat with  This food trailer deserves to be much more famous. I highly recommend you check it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,239,This place wins on so many counts.  I had never heard of a  Mexican  hot dog and had no idea what to expect.  Also the idea of another food truck in Austin trying to do some fusion always makes me kind of skeptical.  This place really met my expectations all around and even surpassed them.   I had the premium dog  which taste wise was amazing.  I have never had such a unique and tasty hot dog.  But apart from the food which I think all can agree on here is really fantastic the service was great and very friendly.    I will most certainly be returning and I think this place might become a regular spot for me 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,240,Lived in Tucson for a little bit and this style dog is the number one thing I missed. This gem is tucked off burnet road close to 49th. If you miss the turn in...turn around. It s worth it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,241,Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Hot dogs are my favorite food. Born and raised in Chicago- which has hotdog stands on every corner. And this place was great. The owner was a sweetheart- great service and very friendly. The tacos and loaded fries were also amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,242,Hidden Gem  Small menu because they do what they do so well. Don t ever change  Owner is a great guy too 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,243,This is my place to go for Sonoran style hotdogs. Plus they do a mean carne asada burrito and fries  I definitely recommend them. You won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,244,Miguel knows how to throw down a hot dog and a carne asada burrito.  My hubs and nephew got the carne asada burrito and both stated they were excellent. Flavorful  meat was tender  avacado was delicious. Lots of meat. Tortilla was amazing.   My Sonoran Hot Dog I had to  try the  5 vs  6. Both tasted great with a delicious heavenly bun  beans  mustard  mayo  jalopeno sauce with tomatoes and onions. Both dogs were wrapped in bacon. But I think the hebrew national took the gold. It had a better flavor despite having the same dressings. I would go with the hebrew national.  My watermelon mint agua fresca was great.   I only wish for 2 things. The beans on the hot dog were delicious and I wish they were offered in a smaller item than a bean and cheese burrito. The second a fresh side to go with the hot dog. I wasn t quite full with 1  but the 2nd one was too heavy.   I will go back and tackle the other items. Miguel informative and our customer service was awesome 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,245,Lives up to the hype   The customer service blew me away.  Also  the wind did  as well.  I m not really a hot dog guy  to be honest.  That being said  I ordered a premium Sonora Dog and it was the best hot dog I ve had in years.  Now  the burrito was the real star  for me.  I love burritos with all of my being.  So. Good.  The salsas and concoctions that came with the burrito were also a special treat.  They re across the street from my apartment and I ll definitely be back.  I cannot stress how well the staff treats the customers.  They deserve 6 5 stars for the treatment we received.    Hot dog lovers  Do it up   Burrito connoisseurs  consume mass quantities 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,246,I ordered the hot dog with everything.  Very good.  The people running the trailer were very friendly and helpful.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,247,Now this is my kinda place  A food truck with hot dogs and burritos. Yes please  The hog dog was absolutely delicious nothing that I have ever had before every component was spot on. The burrito was very simple but less is more and in this case it definitely was. Not only was the food great but the service was awesome  The guy who owns this place was very welcoming and took great care of us. We will be going back for sure. If you haven t checked this place out yet your missing out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,248,Reminds me of Tucson.  The owner chef is a great guy. The price for a Sonoran Dog might seem high to the uninitiated... but if you ve had a Sonoran Dog before  it s completely worth it. On my second time back  I also picked up a carne asada burrito- closest thing to a burrito I d get in Tucson  Chipotle Freebirds falls more into the Subway category for me .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,249,There are two top hot dogs in town and Sonora is one of them.  Hot dogs n stuff by Lowes on Shoal Creek is the other.  But let s get to the point here.  I ve been several times  and ...  Gilberto from Houston - you re an idiot.    You bust out one star because the price is a buck too much for you   Stay in Houston  please.  We don t need more A  holes in Austin.  Did you actually taste the dog   Did you know the buns are fed exed in from AZ   Did you actually chat up the awesome owners to find out what they had to offer you salsa wise   obviously not.  moron.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,250,An absolute must. The hot dogs are perfect every time. However the Carne Asada Burrito is best in the City. The whole menu is a safe bet. I don t know about the veggie dog as im a true Texan.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,251,Downright amazing. If you enjoy great food and a taste that s too die for   you owe it to yourself to visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,252,Just had my first Sonoran Hot Dog this evening. It was one of the best hot dogs I ve ever eaten. The taste combination of the dog along with the roasted pepper was superb. This trailer might be hard to see from the road because it is set back from the road  but it is directly across from the Sonic Drive In.   Miguel was manning the trailer this evening. He s a pretty cool guy to hang out with too and talk motorcycles with.  Having a choice between Sonic and Sonora Dogs  I will always go to Sonora from now on.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,253,One of my favorite places to stop after work   Great food  fast friendly service  great food.... Yeah  get the Deluxe Dog all the way   Perfect    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,254,I highly recommend getting the veggie hot dog wrapped in bacon. It s like you re being healthy but with a little something extra. You haven t lived until you ve at least one of their hot dogs. And the carne asada burrito was really good. The meat was nicely charred and the tortilla was huge  So worth the  .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,255,Didn t disappoint. Hotdog is flavorful and the bread is incredible. Going in you think it s going to be a heavy dog but you ll want to get two  Owner is really nice and friendly. He explained everything really well and even gave up extra roasted jalape os to kick it up a notch. Highly recommend you try this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,256,One more five star review for Miguel. This hot dog cart is no joke   I got the Kosher dog wrapped in bacon...because Kosher. You don t really notice the bacon after it has cooked down except in the flavor of the dog.   I also got a burrito which was really good as well. There is homemade guacamole in there and the house salsas are really good too.   Each order comes with a Santa Fe pepper that has been appropriately seasoned and grilled. It s a great touch for a  simple  hot dog stand.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,257,Sonora Hot Dogs is the perfect embodiment of everything I love about local businesses. The husband and wife team who own this trailer are absolutely lovely and the passion they have for making good food really shows. There are no subpar hot dogs here as every hot dog served is carefully crafted with the utmost attention.   I got a premium dog because I am a sucker for Hebrew National dogs and got everything on it. Try the Sonoran style at least once - it might sound like too much  but everything just works. They cut the bun in such a way that stuff is not dripping out of either end while you eat - I LOVE this. Truly brilliant and I wish every hot dog bun came cut that way. The grilled pepper they give you on the side  So tasty. The cucumber aguas frescas was super refreshing and downright delicious.   I could spend my money absolutely anywhere  but it feels nice to know that I spent it somewhere local  helping to support a small business with kind  hard-working owners. There s just something I really love about supporting good people in achieving their dreams. Feels good  man.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,258,I ve been eating these dogs for a long time.  They are as good as I ve ever had. The ingredients are well thought out and the roasted pepper is purfect on the side. Can t wait until July 28th  National Hot Dog Day.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,259,I love that this place has veggie hot dogs and other vegetarian options  The customer service is excellent. We had their veggie hot dogs  ranch fries without the bacon and because it was our first time the owners made us their vegetarian taco to try and it was delicious  We will definitely be back for some more yummy food 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,260,I had the Sonoran dog and it was excellent. I asked him to give me their most traditional Sonoran dog and it did not disappoint. My buddy had the torta and it was fantastic as well.  Good spot to try on a nice day. The owner was very cool and chatted with us about the history and food in general. Very knowledgeable and nice guy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,261,Great loses up hot dog  great taco  very fresh ingredients  great service. I highly recommend this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,262,I LOVE THIS PLACE      The food is AMAZING  super delicious always fresh  fast  and the service is fantastic too. The owner  Miguel is awesome. He is a fantastic host. There s always good music and a nice ambiance. I recommend this place from the bottom of my heart
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,263,Be forewarned   two prime dogs  made with Hebrew National Franks  and two Topo Chicos commanded  17 . Yeah. For two hot dogs. Hmmm... this seems quite steep after growing up with the always delicious James Coney Island in Houston. Still....  they are delicious hot dogs. I ordered the  Con Todo.  Not sure what the beans add to it... the rest made a wonderful goopy mess  but the real star was the bun  which seems to be more grilled or toasted than merely steamed. I would like another hot dog right now  but next time I need a fork to scoop everything that fell off.  Friendly service  pleasant shady place to sit. A few flies  but at least no mosquitoes.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,264,Classic  authentic Mexican hot dogs. Staple food truck to expand your Mexican palette.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,265,First time here. Driving from McAllen back to Dallas. Nice people  good food  awesome pineapple Agua Fresca. Could not ask for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,266,This was literally one of THE BEST hotdogs I ve ever had    I had two of the Sonorans with all the magic. The glorious bacon wrapped hotdog  beans and the tomato  onions and hints of salt just to name a few... and all on a bun that is so perfect it defies description    I ordered two and thought I might have gone too deep... but a handful of minutes later and they were both gone without a trace. Light and delicious  I could have had 4 more. To top it off super cool people who run it and a real cool vibe  this spot just made my regular list
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,267,Delicious hot dog  I had the Hebrew National  wrapped in bacon  with the beans  and salsa. The bun was toasty and good all on its own. We came here with the Austin Passbook and we ll definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,268,Amazing hotdog  fantastic burrito made by the best lady i have ever met. Thank you for a great service  We will definitely come back for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,269,BEST HOTDOG EVER    BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE    COOKED WITH LOVE      We arrived just 25 mins before closing ... And not only did he not turn us away  he made us the best hot dog in Austin  and you can totally tell it was made with love to perfection. Anyone that is jammin to music while cooking is good wit us      Thank you     
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,270,The bun has to be the best part of their hot dog. Definitely the bacon wrapped around the weiner is a Sonora touch with the toppings  but the beans are such a Tucson  AZ thing  Overall  I d come back here con mis amigo de Mexico. Also  the staff here are so charismatic and they speak Spanish
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,271,Just finished one of their carne asada burritos and the kids had a couple of the hot dogs and we couldn t be happier. Delicious and slightly spicy they made us all very happy campers.  I also wanted to note that my battery died while sitting in the lot and the owner graciously gave me a jump and sent me on my way.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,272,If you have been to Guero Canelos in Tucson.....well you can get the same taste right here in Austin  Texas.    Definitely must check out and enjoy their Sonoran hotdogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,273,I visited T-Loc s Sonoran Style Hot Dogs last night as part of Austin s Truck and Trailer food festival Truck By TruckWest. Their signature entry into the competition was a simply phenomenal hot dog wrapped in bacon and served in the softest  most awesome bolillo-type roll I may have ever tasted. Topped with pinto beans  diced tomatoes and onions  mustard  a squiggle of mayonnaise. It may not sound amazing when I describe it like that but let me tell you  it is fan-F CKING-tastic    I mean it. This is hands-down the best hot dog I have had in years  bar-none.  It was served to us by the super-cool proprietor  Mike Kaiser  who graduated from Le Cordon Bleu and who used to work at Thomas Keller s renowned Per Se restaurant. He was way nice. Laid Back. Eager to talk about his beloved creation and all around an exemplary host. I learned from him that  T-Loc  stands for  Tucson Local. Which I thought was some pretty awesome representin  of his home set. And that those awesome rolls are FedExed in from Arizona daily  Seriously  Along with the special tortillas he uses in his burritos. This place is a must visit if you have EVER liked hot dogs. You gotta go get some. This is best new thing in hot dogs you can get 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,274,I think my friends like me a whole lot more after introducing them to Sonora Hot Dogs.  We pulled up right after open- it was easy enough to find and there was ample parking. As I inspected the menu board I overheard a patron exclaim   Man  that was awesome  You made a believer out of me   Oooh  good sign   I ordered a veggie dog con todo sans onions along with a bean and cheese burrito. Was I that hungry  No  but I had to try it all. The orders did take a while to arrive  but I m pretty sure it was the owner working by his lonesome. When the food did come  it was well worth it.  As I ve seen other reviewers remark  the extreme toppings stay in the bun perfectly somehow.. it defies nature  Although the plethora of ingredients seem overwhelming  the mustard  mayo  tomatoes  beans  and jalapeno sauce compliment the dog so  so well. The bun was PERFECTLY soft and chewy and every bite was perfect- even the ones outside of the realm of the regular sized hot dog. The pepper on the side was roasted and dusted with salt  the perfect spiciness that when shredded on the hot dog  really enhanced the flavor.  The burrito was okay. standard beans and cheese in a tortilla  but the tortilla was AWESOME. You don t find tortillas like this in Austin  This dish could be greatly improved with just an addition of salsa  I was given a side of the hod dog s jalapeno sauce  but it was much too watery for the burrito .  At the end of the meal there were many exclamations-  Good call Katie   and  OH GOD  that bun was good   They were right. Other sausage establishments may cater to meat craftsmanship or wow factor  but Sonora doesn t need that- they ve got the right flavor and they re letting it roll.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,275,OMG     Everyone NEEDS to eat here     You are missing out if you haven t had their food yet. My favorites are the Sonora Hotdogs and the Carne Asada Fries  The owner is awesome    Really makes the visit more enjoyable  Really a must stop if you re looking for the best food in town
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,276,I will drive from Leander for these   I ve had Sonoran hot dogs in Tucson and these are the real thing  Get you one 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,277,Do you like hot dogs  I hope so because why else would you come here  These hot dogs taste bombastic.   You can also get a quesadilla or even a premium hot dog that uses Hebrew national dogs instead of the bars type. And yeah they come topped with a lot of stuff so tackling even one hot dog will be a task.  They make hot dogs more yummy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,278,I grew up in Tucson on Sonoran Dogs  but somehow Miguel uses such better ingredients that you can totally taste the difference  which is why his are better than any I ve ever had in Tucson or Mexico  even Guero Canello and street vendors.   He s also expanded his menu to include ranch fries  think Eegee s but with real bacon  and AZ CA carne asada and breakfast burritos. I seriously missed breakfast burritos until t-locs came around  no offense Austin breakfast tacos  I love you too  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,279,This place is a must-go-to.  I love their quesadillas.  Best ever   The tortilla they use is very tasty and they aren t stingy with the meat.  The overall taste is really terrific.  I think the quality of cheese they use is part of the greatness.    The owners are really fantastic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,280,Trailblazing the frontiers of the Sonoran style in Austin. Truly pushing the envelope on what is possible.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,281,This may come as a surprise to some  but wienies are not on my regular diet.    I don t have kids and I don t eat fast food much so hot dogs and burgers are easily avoided to save my waistline.  However  this place keeps  starring   on my Yelp feed and it s in BFF s  hood  so we decided to try it.    Have I mentioned that BFF has a  touch  of OCD   So  he of course read each review and had a plan going in.  He was gonna get one Sonoran dog and one carne asada burrito.  I only wanted to eat one of those so I opted for the dog since I so rarely get to eat those.    We found the  tiny  trailer easy enough but only because it s a trailer.  There s no big sign saying what it is but it s in a parking lot with the Conscious Cravings trailer and some picnic tables so it s easy to spot.  We both knew we wanted the fresh agua fresca and the flavor that day was cucumber.  That was so good and refreshing and had me pining for some vodka to spike it  or  as suggested by the sweet cook  some Hendricks Gin .    The wait for food was not too long but just enough to know it was made fresh and to empty our cucumber waters.  I had some cash out to buy another glass when they said the first refill was on the house.  THANKS      Back at BFF s apt  we could not wait to dig in.  I will admit that  while I thought the hot dog was really good  I was blown away by the burrito.  And if you like heat  the grilled pepper that comes with the dog can be shredded and added to it for a nice kick  and the red sauce with the burrito will hurt so good  but I preferred the tangy green  tomatillo   sauce.  My only complaint with this trailer is I wish they would offer sides.  One dog was not enough  but two would have been too much  so I opted to get a couscous salad from CC next door.  And  I ll just reiterate  I wish Sonora would offer sides.  I choked down a few bites of that just to make me feel healthy and crunchy but blech.  So Sonora  even just a bag of chips would be sufficient.  Or  maybe a bowl of your beans  I did ask for a side of beans and they misunderstood and put my dog beans in a tiny cup on the side .    I have no doubt I ll be back  with a flask  for more of that agua fresca and a burrito.  I ll just pretend the guacamole in the burrito is my healthy helping of greens.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,282,What a taste treat   I enjoyed my first Sonora hot dog today and it was soooo good  the only problem was I ate it too fast   I got the premium Hebrew National dog with everything except mayo and it was very  very  very good.  I took a carne asada burrito home for later  but only half of it made it to my refrigerator.  The drink was a blend of orange juice  blended strawberries and a little sugar and it was perfect.  Very friendly service from the family run business.  Highly recommended 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,283,I was super skeptical the very first time I came here and a friend said....do you trust me  Oh my God it was absolutely amazing the best hot dog I ve ever had the burrito was to die for. So let me start by by saying not only do I not like beans which comes in the Sonoran con Todo but I don t like pico de gallo  which comes on the burrito. I have now referred at least 50 people to this place because it is that amazing I love his Sonoran hot dog and I love his burrito and his fresh pico de gallo and his roasted peppers are amazing
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,284,While I like variety  I also like places that have only a few items on their menu and do them well.  I got their premium hotdog which consisted of jalapeno sauce  mayo  mustard  onions  cooked or raw  I went with cooked   tomatoes  hebrew national dog wrapped in bacon  they have a veg dog option too  with pinto beans served on a perfect lightly toasted bun. After my first bite couple of bites I said   that s a damn good hot dog.  and it is. It looked like a work of art too. I was still hungry afterwards and while I really wanted another hot dog  I figured I d try their carne asada burrito too and it was pretty darn good in it s own right and they do not skimp out on the steak. They also gave me a little taste of their mango agua fresca which was very refreshing on a hot Austin day.  In addition to the hot dog  the stars of the show with out a doubt are Miguel and Zulma who make sure you feel welcomed  happy and full. They are the best   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,285,I see a lot of love in the reviews for the carne asada which I was not super impressed with but when a place has hot dog in the name  I only need them to do one dish well. This will easily be the best hot dog you ve ever eaten. Lots of places  elevate  hot dogs by serving sausages instead of hot dogs  looking at you Frank  and that s the easy way out. A sonora style hot dog takes ordinary hot dogs and turns them into art  or at least that s what they re doing in this truck. I ve never been to Sonora.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,286,Dang. Great hot dog. I hope these guys do well and stay around for a long time. Go for the signature Sonoran Dog  con todo . It was great. I wish I had gotten 2 cause now I m thinking about it all day    I added an aqua fresca  watermelon juice  that was a perfect compliment to the meal.    Really nice folks running the place too. I can t wait to return.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,287,My wife and I decided to give this place a try for lunch today.  The verdict   They re really tasty   Wrapping the hot dog in bacon adds some welcome chewiness and crunchiness to the texture  the condiments fit together well  and the bun has just a hint of sweetness.  It s definitely an awesome  unique  and valid approach to a hot dog  and I m glad I got to try it.  The pineapple water my wife got to drink was really good as well  lightly sweetened and with a touch of coconut.  So what s keeping me from giving it five stars   Value for money  mostly.  The Sonora dog with a Bar S hot dog is  5  but I suspect most people are going to pay the extra  1 to upgrade to a Hebrew National hot dog.  Based on the photos here  I was expecting the hot dogs to be a little bigger  maybe the size of a 1 4 pound dinner frank.  However  these are regular size hot dogs -- they don t cover the full length of the bun -- and if you re really hungry  one probably won t be enough.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,288,T-Loc hot dog all the way   -  Fantastic food  Great prices  very good service  Miguel made it feel more like a backyard cookout
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,289,I thought I hit up the Burrito and Quesadilla from this place being that I hadn t had solid Carne Asada in awhile. As soon as I unwrapped the Quesadilla and took a bite with some of the Guac I literally put it back in the box sat back and said  Oh hell yes  . Something so simple as a tortilla with cheese had so much flavor it was astounding. The guac  pico and salsa were on point and the burrito was a tremendous balance of ingredients. The quantity is spot on to because I had trouble finishing just my burrito but the food was so good I ended up eating the whole Quesadilla afterwards because I just couldn t wait  D.  The guy behind the counter  IDK if he was the owner  was very relaxed and easy going and there s a nice area to sit and chow down with umbrella s over the tables for shade. I can t recommend it enough and I haven t even tried the Hot Dog s yet  which looks just as spectacular . Great place 5 stars and I ll be going again .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,290,Awesome burrito. I had the Eggsplosion with cheese  and it was fantastic. Carne Asada  retried beans  some spice to it  and eggs that break while you re eating it. A great big  beautiful mess. Last week I had the loaded fries  which were also awesome. The guy who cooks it all up  T-Loc himself  maybe   is super friendly. I will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,291,Best Sonoran dogs in Austin. Are used to live in Tucson so I m very familiar with these and these are the best I ve ever had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,292,The best of the best   I m not a big fun of hotdogs but I will admit am addicted to hotdogs after today   the bun is yummy and taste is sweet spicy it s amazing   The guy that serves the fun  Miguel   I think he sure knows about a good customer service    Awesome guy   Great vibe and the music made me feel like home  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,293,If you like hot dogs  definitely come here and try that. A hot dog with onions  tomatoes  jalapeno sauce  beans I don t like beans actually but it fits to that hot dog   bacon and beef frankfurter. It is expensive for a hot dog  6.50  but worths it  Best of Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,294,Best hotdog I have every had in my life. Cool place to eat nice environment great place to have a nice lunch. Really recommend trying it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,295,Miguel and crew make a spot on Sonoran Hot Dog that would compete with the standards from our former home Tucson. The twist is he offers premium beef and vegetarian option for you fufu Austinites.  My only complaint would be I think the price point is high. Specifically for the Bar S dog    5. Then again  he sources the bun from AZ so the costs probably represent that.  Represent Miguel 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,296,Just finished scarfing down my Sonora dog and carne asda burrito... it was great   It was my first time getting food from there  and was extremely pleased to put it mildly.  It s a small little food trailer with a dining yard and 3 picnic tables.  I got a Sonora Hot Dog  which has a  bacon wrapped wiener  you can choose the type of wiener you want Bar S or Hebrew  with onions  mayo mustard  chopped tomatoes  grilled onions  jalapeno sauce  and beans.  This dog was out of sight.  I thought is was one of the absolute best hot dogs I ve ever had.  The presentation of it was pretty too.  The mayo and mustard are squeezed on  in a nice zig-zag-type way  instead of spread.  The roasted chile on the side is a great contrast to the hot dog s flavor.  After eating that  I could have been satisfied hunger wise... I went moderately hungry.    Of course  I also ordered the carne asda burrito b c when i go somewhere new  i order eat way too much b c I m afraid I may never make it back.  The burrito consists of a 1 2 pound of chopped steak w  mash avocado and fresh pico.  It was was equally pleasing in a totally different way.  My meat was very tender.  It came w  green and red sauce on the side.   The couple working were very welcoming and friendly.  I was offered a free sampling of the daily flavored water  today was hibiscus  I believe  I didn t clearly hear what flavor it was.  I will go back for sure.  You should go  NOW 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,297,As a Tucson native  these hot dogs are famous and not sold anywhere else. However  I have found them here in Austin. If you have not tried them  you MUST DO SO ASAP. They re absolutely delicious and t-locs does them perfectly. With amazing Tucson favorite foods served here  it s seriously not to be missed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,298,My girlfriend and I are regulars here for a reason they have the best hot dogs and carne asadas. Miguel the owner is a great dude and excellent chief same with his significant other. Highly recommend people try their food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,299,Any bad review has obviously never had an authentic Sonora hotdog. This place is amazing. I wish I could eat here for every meal. The burritos are to die for. The bread used in the hot dogs is all the way from Tucson  and there s a reason for it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,300,What is a Sonora hot dog  I don t know but it was ah-mazing  Ok really it s this delicious style of hot dog that s popular in Arizona. I ve never had anything like it in Texas. They ship the bread in from AZ to keep it authentic. Light fluffy  slightly sweet bread  loaded with saucy beans and topped with a hot dog grilled in bacon then covered in mayo  mustard  ketchup  and diced tomatoes onions. I think there was something slight spicy too  maybe. Party of flavors in your mouth. I got hints of that classic childhood dish  frank and beans  but with a little zing. Topped mine off with a Mexican coke for  7. Mmm-hmm. Open till 10pm 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,301,I ve sampled everything on the menu now and I regret only that I can t rate them even higher. The Sonora hot dog that gives this place its name has a wonderful balance of ingredients that come together perfectly. Don t skip the grilled pepper - it s got just enough salt sprinkled on it to bring out the flavor delightfully  And yes  it s noticeably better with the Hebrew National hot dog  although still tasty with the Bar-S dog. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla are full of just-right beef and fantastic guacamole with no cheap but flavorless filler. The bean and cheese burrito is tasty  very filling  and somehow manages not to fall apart when you eat it. The cheese quesadilla is yummy and a perfect vehicle for allowing their flat out spectacular pico de gallo to shine. And the watermelon agua fresca I had with my order tonight was absolutely amazing - I can t imagine a better drink.  Wonderful food made with care. A glowing example of how truly magnificent a few humble items can be when prepared with the best ingredients and attention to detail.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,302,BEST HOTDOGS EVER. I was looking for a place that did a good street dog for a long time and AT LAST T-Loc s or Tuscan Locals is hands down the best hotdog around. This place is kinda hidden in a little food truck lot. Do yourself a favor and Visit Miguel for a hotdog  I had the  Con todo  premium dog. I would have taken a picture if I didn t inhale the hotdog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,303,If you haven t been here  please just go.  The food was delicious.  They know what they are good at and do it with excellence.  Service  cleanliness  quality  fun.  They don t currently offer sides simply because this is a traditional  Mexican  style street food vendor which don t serve sides  just delectable main dishes and refreshing drinks. Even the simple bean  amp  cheese burrito on homemade buttery  thin  amp  flaky tortillas is de-lish   But keep coming back  they ll add specials each season and you might even find a creative side dish  soup or Mexican Hot Chocolate for cooler months show up.  Zulema  amp  Michael are the perfect hosts and welcome you warmly to their casita.  Thanks you two for making a lovely date night with my prince so fun  - Richard  amp  Cobi  PS  Make sure you grab your wristbands for Truck by Truckwest and come check out Sonora Hot Dogs from Tuscon  AZ.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,304,I went here to eat try one of their hot dogs on a warm Saturday night and I was NOT disappointed. It was to die for   Nuf said. If you haven t gone here  please do yourself a favor and try it out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,305,This trailer is great   The owner operating couple really love their food and it shows.   They serve best hot dog in Austin.   The bun is a wonderfully light  slightly sweet bread - not your standard bready hot dog bun.  You get your choice of dog including Veggie dogs.  The condiments range from the usual to tasty beans  onions  and  best of all  a roasted  amp  steamed blond pepper.  A perfect combination of ingredients which are seriously addictive. They have other options such as burritos and quesadillas but we cannot get past their veggie dogs   Also  their homemade aguas frescas are some of the best we have had.  They change weekly  this week was horchata and tamarindo - next week peach .  The aguas frescas alone will make us visit this trailer each week.  The couple that runs this trailer take the time to introduce themselves  discuss their food and its origin with previews of what is coming next week.   They remember what your preferences all while greeting you like old friends. They make a stop at this trailer truly extraordinary.   Very much worth a stop  you will be hooked - we are 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,306,Very very good    I tried the carne asada on a burrito and tacos  and it was very good  Have to return to taste the famous burrito... can t wait 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,307,Excellent  very very good    The hotdogs and the burros are awesome and authentic  Try the  aguas frescas    Im from Sonora   Mexican state  and this are the real deal  the bread is very good and the tortillas too  the food is delicious...everything is very clean  the service is awesome. Si tienen ganas de pasar un rato agradabe y comer muy rico no dejen de ir  los due os son muy amables  todo esta limpisimo y la comida los har  volver  Exito  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,308,This has quickly become my favorite trailer in Austin.  Miguel and his wife are great hosts who put customer service first.  Living in Tucson  I ve come to miss sonora dogs.  T-loc s satisfied my need to go back for a visit. The aqua fresca is amazing.  The Carne asada maybe the best burrito in Austin. The dogs are just like walking out of Guero Canelo in Tucson. Get to this trailer.  You won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,309,Wow  This little trailer really packs in the flavor. Hubby got  the best hot dog of his life.  Special bun with a bacon wrapped grilled hot dog topped with special mayo on a bed of beans and pico - add a grilled jalape o and you have a winner. I had the asada burrito and it was delicioso  The steak was grilled to perfection paired with guacamole on a fantastic tortilla. To be honest I didn t want to stop eating but I could not finish it- it is huge.  You won t be disappointed or hungry either.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,310,The guy manning the truck was super-friendly.  Truck was new  amp  super-clean.  I got the plain dog  no bacon   but with everything else.  It was good.  The onions were nicely grilled  amp  the dog was served with a very mid grilled pepper.  The bun was soft  too soft in my opinion as it made for rather a soggy dog with the beans.  Free sample of the Pineapple Horchata agua fresca was muy deliciouso - I could not stop gulping it.  I wanted to love this place  but like is the best I can give it.  Paid  5 for a dog  amp  I m still hungry.  Think I ll have to go back to my old reliable  chili-cheese dog next time I m craving a hot dog fix.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,311,The food here is great because the owners believe wholeheartedly in their product. Great ingredients  attention to detail and they love their customers. And not just because we are paying  they really like our southern open arms  y all  .   Their menu is well thought out. They have quesidillas for the kids and veggie dogs for those that don t  ya know  eat the meat. The salsa s good and pinto beans done to my liking. This is after-all the make or break of any joint selling Mexican cuisine.  And while I liked the Sonora Dog my shout-out goes to the carne asada burrito. That with the red sauce reminded me of my favorite southern californian joint  Juanitas.   Glad they moved to my hood. Try it  or just go buy and say howdy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,312,Yo  That hibiscus aqua fresca is no joke. I want forty of them.   This is my new favorite food truck. It s quick  it s damn good. The hot dog was great  and the burrito is a hidden gem. It s the perfect balance of carne asada steak  some guac and pico de gallo. The owner operators are a great addition to Austin -- super friendly and putting out great food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,313,OMG Yes   For anyone who s lived in Tucson  or Sonora  this is a must when in Austin. I was a bit skeptical when reading they ship their bread in from Arizona  but upon trying it I was convinced. They don t make bolillos like that in Texas. The people who own it are super friendly too. Bear Down 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,314,This ain t no fast food dog  it s more of a culinary work of art. The bacon wrapped dog and toasted bun are excellent  and all of the other ingredients work perfectly. Nice clean food court off Burnet Road  easy parking  fast service  nice tables. It s a winner 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,315,meh.  I tried a Sonora dog  everything on it as recommended and thought it was decent. I d had plenty of worse hot dogs  but quite a few better ones as well. It s nice to have an option in Austin to get a Sonora-style dog but I ve had some this same style in Seattle that I thought were better. Worth trying if you re nearby and curious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,316,The food was fine. But  I feel like they should drop the  s  at the end  because it s misleading. They have exactly one hot dog. They have the same number of quesadillas and burritos - exactly one.  The guys were super nice. Their food is good. Still...  Our favorite hot dog joint went down about two months ago  and there s nothing like them anymore. We found Sonora while looking to fill that  hotdog partaking void   seeking the options of Sriracha  fried egg  chili  jalape os  sour kraut  bacon  or something like that.  There  you can have a Sonora  or a plain hotdog. So  a bacon wrapped dog with beans  amp  cilantro  or without  so  plain . Or  you can have a quesadilla or a burrito.  I can t say I won t go back  I very well may. But  I wish I d known what to expect before I drove there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,317,Delicious   Not your average hot dog.  The bread and the mix of flavorings make this the best hot dog I ve ever had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,318,I am from a city in Baja California that is an hour away from Sonora where they have this kind of hotdog everywhere. So when I found this place I thought it was too good to be true but this is as close as it gets to the real Sonora hot dogs and they taste amazing  The owner told me he brings the bread from Sonora  and I gotta tell you this bread is legit  The only downside is they re kinda expensive  like  6 for a hotdog con todo. I am biased though cause back home you get a hotdog WITH fries with all the toppings for  30 pesos  1.50 USD  lol. But everything in Austin is expensive so I probably will come back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,319,Wow. Loved the sonora hotdog. The bun was light and crispy and the sausage had the right amount of saltiness and flavor. I really enjoyed the sauces they put on.  It looks like one man operation and the wait can be long  but i would say it is worth the wait. I wanna go back and try again soon.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,320,My new favorite hot dog  my boyfriend and I eat here weekly. The owner is so personable and obviously loves his job. These dogs taste like straight up happy. The buns are delish and the carne asada burrito don t play it will punch your appetite in the face  it s Good  amp  hearty
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,321, Much too good for children    Matilda - Ms. Trunchbull   That is how I feel each time I devour these hot-dogs  because I want them all  All to myself  They re SO frickin  tasty    I am all-things hot-dogs. Hot-dogs from Man Bites Dog  Chris  Little Chicago  R.I.P   Dog Almighty  Evil Wiener  El Salchichon  LOL - that cracks me up every time   Sonic  meh...   7-11  I know - why would I  right   - you name it  I ve have it. Seriously. There s no kind of sausage that hasn t been in my mouth. I ve had them all.  LOL    Once  a friend from Arizona  who moved to Austin  prepared a few of these for me and I got the sense of what they were  but - unfortunately for him - I was not heavily impressed and didn t understand the hype. It because there was something missing  is what he said. It was the bread. There is a special kind of bread which is ordered specifically for these hot-dogs  I was told by the owner  which means it s not available in Austin. IT IS  ALL  ABOUT THE BREAD.   Oh - and to keep you going back - they change up the fresh water with new flavors weekly. Yesterday  I got a sample cup  4 oz.  of melon juice...oh  my gosh  I loved it. You remember that scene from  Ace Ventura  When Nature Calls  when Jim Carrey walks into the room where all the body-less animal heads are mounted on the wall  and the camera is going around and around as he makes all those creepy and funny faces - with the loud mouthing he makes as he cringes and screams  THAT was how I reacted...in public. Ha   OK  so you better go try one. Or two. Or three. I m having three for dinner today.   - A member of the Wachati Tribe
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,322,Had my first Sonora Hot Dog and fell in love. It was fantastic. My only complaint is that the menu could use some smaller side dishes so that I don t completely wreck myself with an order of carne asada or ranch fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,323,These are some damn good dogs. The guy that runs the joint is super nice and the food  while it may sound a little weird  is so damn good.  That s all I have to say. Go eat here  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,324,Awesome dog. The flavors come together very well. I also grabbed a steak taco which was excellent.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,325,This place is great. My wife and I have been twice now  and it doesn t disappoint. The Carne asada tacos are amazing and so is the Sonora dog. We are from California and missing GOOD Mexican food  and now we have found it. Sorry  but we are not fans of Tex Mex. This place is is a must.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,326,T-Loc s is now serving breakfast and I may have found a replacement for a breakfast taco in the eggsplosion burrito. Carne Assada  received beans  pico and an over easy egg in that fabulous tortilla is now my go to breakfast. The new location on Burnett is super cute and has plenty of parking and a nice new playscape for the kids. There are a few other dining spots but why do you care when T-Loc s is right there 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,327,My wife and I found out about some Tucson Locals who decided to open up a Sonoran style hot dog stand out here in Austin.  Being someone who enjoys a good dog on a regular basis  I decided to check them out. Absolutely amazing  so much so that I had to get a second dog just to enjoy that taste again. The guy who runs the store does a great job with customer service.  I plan on going back when he opens up for lunch with a few guys from work.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,328,best Sonora dogos i have tried outside Sonora. worth the drive from home
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,329,Coming from AZ this place hits home. Sonoran hot dogs are a favorite of mine and this places does it right. If you have never had one of these fabulous dogs YOU MUST try this great place out   I will definitely be a repeat customer   This is a great addition to the Austin food scene.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,330,I had lunch here the other day and I dig it. Where else can you get a quality dog and a burrito at the same time  Well  I do miss my old hot dog stands in Chicago  but this will do for me  Still very unique and creative dogs to say the least  -Ed
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,331,Finally got to try this place  Two dogs is more than enough food for a large hungry guy. Get the dogs fully loaded  So much flavor packed into a handheld meal. Can t wait to come back. Didn t get the name of the lady behind the counter  but she was super nice and explained the food to us 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,332,The best hot dog place in town. The Sonora dog all the way is the only way to go. A mouth full of awesomeness in every bite. I don t get to make it down in this area too much but when I do it s on my list to eat at. There s several other things on the menu that look really good as well but I always go with the Sonora dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,333,Delish   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a   if this place was closer to my house I would probably be here daily.   Carne asada is fresh and the hot dogs are soooooooooooo amazing...... best dogs in town.  I challenge anyone to these amazing hot dogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,334,Wow the are awesome  the food and the people. I will always be looking forward to coming back again and again. The sonora hot dogs here are even better than the place I went to in Chandler  AZ. The owners are the friendliest people and superior customer service.  If you don t go here at least once  well you will have missed the best experience ever.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,335,DELICIOSO   I LOVE food trucks and wish that the world would hop onto the craze like this city but ohh well.  I was looking for a semi quick bite to eat while letting a friend nap at the hotel before we headed out  for SXSW  but still wanted something unique to the area.  Happy that me and the rest of my crew stopped here because it was AMAZING. Literally finger licking good  The owner is a really cool guy who makes sure you feel comfortable and I love the outdoor seating.   It s in a little parking lot with some other food trucks so that s cool too. Only reason it isn t 5 stars is because seeing that it s a food truck  not all the food handling is as wished  perfecto but it s still safe to eat  not dirty or anything. Just don t like how some stuff is kept warm   Happy eating   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,336,The Sonora-style hot dog is what the trailer is named after but the carne asada burrito is not to be missed. This is NOT the type of burrito bomb you d find at Chipotle. Here  it s a very thin tortilla wrapped around tender marinated steak  pico de gallo and avocado  and served with both red and green sauce and lime. The hot dog is awesome but the carne asada burrito steals the show. And don t miss the agua fresca. Just delicious 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,337,Went there today for the first time not knowing what to expect. Boy was I up for a nice treat  These hot dogs are something else. The presentation  amazing and when I took my first bite  I was blown away. They serve it with a freshly roasted chile of some sort and it was  hands down  the best hot dog I have...ever had  I got to talk to the owner  Mike  and he is super nice  took his time explaining everything about those hot dogs. Incredible.  Highly recommended and will be going back for sure.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,338,Exclusive 5 for the carne asada burrito. I was nervous about  smashed avocado  with  chopped steak  by itself. Every solid burrito I know has some essence of bean and rice. The cook modified my order for a fusion Sonora burrito and it was AMAZING. Lime on my burrito is not a new concept  but it s fresh and revived here at Sonora Hot Dogs. I was too distracted by satiation that I didn t even bother to savor the hot dog. I m not a fan of skinny dogs anyway. The burrito was much worth every delicious penny. Double the hot sauce next time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,339,I almost cried when they moved locations. But  Here they are and I m ecstatic  Are you from California  do you love carne asada burritos  I do. And here they are. In all their delicious  Robertos glory  No beans  rice  queso  nacho cheese  gravy  sour cream. It s just meat  lots of meat. Guacamole and pico. It s the best  8 I spend. Are you hungry yet 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,340,The carne asada burrito was BADASS    The green sauce is pretty amazing as well. I will definitely be coming back many many times in the near future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,341,Delicious best hot dogs iv had so far love it can never go wrong with the sonoran hotdog
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,342,Met the owner  very nice guy who chatted us up for a long time. It s cool to see a restaurant where the owners work so hard and are humble people. The food was fantastic and authentic. I ll definitely be back
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,343,This is our absolute go to spot. I love the food here. The service is great. The vegan vegetarian options are really good. Always go  con todo  on the dogs. It s the best. We are regulars and come weekly. Be sure to pickup a loyalty card. Try this place  you won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,344,Owner is Hella friendly and funny.  My dude loved their hot dog so much he had to have two.  That s alot of weiners for one man...  I think the bread is what makes it so special.  It s really toasted and chewy u just gotta try it to know what I m talking about.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,345,The pepper on the side is weird but i hate cooked peppers..hotdog itself is good...nothin special
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,346,Never thought I d be able to have a good Sonoran hotdog in Texas until I saw the name followed by a U of A sticker. Absolutely loved the Sonoran con todo. We also got hot chocolate from here  and it was better than any other I have tried. Great customer service as well as quick turnaround times. Highly recommend 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,347,This place totally sated my hot dog craving this afternoon. And that bun  Nice picnic tables with umbrellas. Will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,348,HOT DOG  This place is legit. It s been on my list for awhile and Mark M. has had nothing but rave reviews for this place. Mark  my husband and I were on Burnet hitting up happy hour. I was getting irritated because Mark and I were 2 for 2 on some pretty terrible interactions with service staff at two places we hit up. We were hungry so we decided to go to Sonora Hot Dogs. They have moved from their location on Burnet and now in front of this beautiful house which by the way is a place where people play Magic the Gathering a few times a week. No offense but that s so weird to me. Beautiful house but what a waste of space.   We pulled into the lot and my husband hopped out of the car quickly and asked if there was restroom we could use. Miguel was super friendly and let us in to the house. So now down to business. We walked up to the window and we were ready to order. Miguel had recognized Mark M from yelp and from his visits previous. Miguel is the epitome of hospitality and service. Hubby and I ordered a premium dog and a carne asada burrito. I was so happy that he had topo chico and gave us limes for it too. There s plenty of seating when the Magic the Gathering geeks aren t there. I imagine that when they re in session there s only a few picnic tables that are in front of the trailer. We were enjoying the nice weather and Hubby had walked over to the near by gas station to get some brews. He bought some Tecate and Miguel gave us limes for that too  Shortly our food was coming out piping hot. I didn t get a chance to taste the hot dog because hubby demolished it but he enjoyed it very much. Come on a bacon wrapped hot dog that s constructed in such a way that makes every bite perfect and even with all the toppings. My carne asada burrito was THA BOMB  Little beef morsels so tender and perfect with avocado. Every bite so perfect. I wanted to take the carne asada and throw it on top of french fries for carne asada fries but that s a totally different story  Everything is made to order with so much love  care and precision. Gotta appreciate a place that really takes the time and care in what they re doing.   I was so happy to finally come here and meet Miguel. Definitely need to come back and try the hot dog since it disappeared before more eyes. Come see Miguel  chat him up  taste his food and give him some Yelp love 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,349,This place was found by complete serendipity. I came specifically for another unnamed island food truck as I noticed their ratings. I arrived early to beat the lines. 10 minutes after the stated opening time  the proprietor arrived and said it would be awhile. New opening time 90 minutes later posted. I digress. I ve never had a Sonora style hot dog  I was already in my lunch hour and decided to try. A bacon wrapped hotdog with assorted other delicious additives in a toasted bun  Hell yes. Bacon and hotdog cooked perfectly and blended well with the toppings. And I thought I was a ketchup hotdog guy. Sonora style hotdogs are now my new go to. Every time. Friendly owners add to an already great experience. One day I will again try for the aforementioned and unnamed island food truck. That day was not today.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,350,Very good hot dog   I got the regular  con todo  .  It comes with a toasted bun  bacon wrapped hot dog  beans tomatoes  onions   pickles  ketchup   mustard and mayo.  Very fresh and good. Price was  5.  Check it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,351,Everything is awesome  The hot dog is the best everything else is second.owner is truley kind and awesome. Im totally coming back can even byob 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,352,My husband and I come here on the regular...these hotdogs are to die for  We ve introduced them to our friends and they ve become regulars too. Burritos and tacos are also fantastic. Both the veggie dog and veggie taco options are top pics of mine. The chef and mastermind behind T-Locs is actually highly trained in the culinary arts so you can bet this won t be just your average food truck. Seriously  you won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,353,My only regret is that I have worked less than a mile away for 2 years and just had a sonora dog today  Out of this world delicious  I will be going back again and again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,354,Excellent  We loved the bread  the toppings  and the service. Such a great little spot  and we ll definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,355,Amazing hot dogs and an awesome guy making them     The bread is amazing and they offer really good hot dogs   The quesadilla was pretty damn good too. It doesn t hurt that the owner is super cool and down to earth. I hope these guys to far   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,356,Always good when I need my fix.  Owner is a cool dude and the hot dogs always hit the spot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,357,had the carne asada burrito which I noticed everyone is raving about.  flavors good  tortilla and guacamole excellent.  Meat was nearly inedible.  few things will detract more from a meal than having to spit out large  tough gristly pieces after almost every bite.  knew I should have just stuck with a hot dog.  oh  and I m really beginning to fervently dislike these credit card swiping machines which pressure you into tipping someone for handing you one small 9 dollar burrito and a napkin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,358,At first I was skeptical about a blazing five-star review for this tiny little food truck  but I decided to give it a try and from the very first sip of their agua fresca  I was already blown away. I had a pineapple one and it was amazing - just sweet enough and bursting with fresh pineapple flavor. The attention to detail makes this place special. Think I will be a regular for the foreseeable future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,359,Miguel is awesome. These are the best hot dogs in Austin. If you like hot dogs  look no further. I used to work for Oscar Meyer and Nathan s  trust me I know my hot dogs. I was a taste tester for hot dogs for 19 years. If you want a hot dog that will make you cream your pants and scream daddy  this is where it ends.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,360,Best hot dog ever   I m not kidding. I have had a lot of hotdogs through the years and this one is exceptional. The bun is perfectly cooked and it is a great design. It is uncut on both ends to keep all of the goodness in. They say they have a great burrito which I will try on the next visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,361,I love this place  The staff is so nice and friendly  One of them even gifted me a water bottle trying to cure the spicy green pepper  Great food. Great people. Great atmosphere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,362,Such a delicious mouth watering beautiful brown grilled bun served with everything you need. Devoured mine in less than 2 minutes. I got everything but the mustard and jalape o sauce. I ve got to say Im impressed. Being that I am from Dallas  always searching for the best hot dog can often leave me disappointed. This time I was not. This is a great spot anytime. Service was amazing  everything was so neat. The playground was definitely a plus. My daughter was able to play on her own at a safe distance and we were able to enjoy our masterpiece.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,363,Just like home   We were so happy to discover this place after missing food from Tucson   Everything was amazing  520 style   Not to mention the owners were so welcoming and accommodating to celebrating my birthday with them.  We will be back time and time again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,364,The carne asada was utterly delightful  it was like a major flavor fiesta was happening in my mouth. Miguel was very friendly and attentive. This is hands down  my favorite food truck in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,365,This place is AMAZING  I had left my purse there and drove all the way home before I realized it. At least an hour.  I returned and they had my purse with everything inside. I tried to tip them and they refused.  The service is amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,366,Great Frank s with all the fixings. Great upbeat attitude matching the flavorful goodies  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,367,This is legit the best hotdog I have ever eaten  remember to upgrade to the premium meat  haven t had the other one  but the Sonoran hotdogs are one of my top four favorite foods in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,368,So delicious   Tried the hot dogs at Trucklandia today  they immediately accommodated our gluten-free dietary needs and served us a  taco  dog. Best customer service at Trucklandia  and one of the most authentic Mexican food experiences I ve had in Austin so far. Completely recommend.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,369,The hotdogs were out of this world    The bread was amazing  they use really fresh vegetables  I totally recommend this place  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,370,The carne asada burrito is just as legit as the dogs...you can t go wrong with either choice.  Heavily suggest the Premium dog.  They re tucked away from street view  so look for the signs and banners.  Definitely going to swing by here for breakfast to see if it s as good as the carne asada burrito 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,371,This hot dog definitely hit the spot. Friendly staff  nice shaded seating.  I had the regular sonoran hot dog. Next time  I ll try the premium.  Also looking forward to trying the carne asasda.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,372,Can t believe I waited so long to try these guys. Not just because the owner is from Tucson  I m a Wildcat myself   but because it was THAT good. I had the Carne Asada Burrito  and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. The steak was tender and it s one of the best tortillas I ve had in Austin. The two salsas were really good  too.  The red salsa reminded me of the chile we use to make tamales  so it was like eating at home. If you ve seen them and are on the fence about stopping  just go   You won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,373,Normally  I go there for the excellent bacon wrapped hot dogs known as Sonora Hot Dogs. Today I branched out and got the carne asada burrito. BEST DECISION of the day and maybe month. Following the sage advice of pouring a bit of salsa and a squirt of lime on each bite alternating the salsas  I had one of the best meals of the month. Quick friendly service and great food are worth every penny. The short wait for such great food prompted me to write my first review of this place after nearly 3 years of going to the various locations this trailer has been parked.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,374,The perfect hot dog  If you re familiar with Sonoran style hot dogs you ll know this place knows what they re doing. The grilled pepper on the side adds to the awesome flavor of the hot dog. Will be back a millon times 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,375,Still have yet to try their hot dogs but the carne asada burrito I got was simply amazing. It reminded me of the burritos back home in Cali  well seasoned carne asada  pico de gallo  and mashed avocado packed into a fresh delicious tortilla. The red hot sauce it came with was spicy and complimented the whole thing perfectly. Not a fan of green sauce in general but it was still pretty good. The guy working the window was very friendly and the food came out lightning quick considering it was all cooked to order. I ll definitely be back to try their famous Sonoran hot dogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,376,Best food truck in Austin. Hands down. Hot dogs are out of this world. Owners are super duper chill and the story is just so awesome. Cant recommend enough.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,377,Super friendly service and awesome hotdog  Coworker  got the carne asada burrito and said it was also on point. Bonus the seating area is clean and relaxing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,378,By far the most delicious hot dog in town. The burritos are amazing. Breakfast is amazing. Ugh it s so good
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,379,A little bit of Tucson in the middle of Tex-Mex country. It was what I always grew up calling  Mexican food. 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,380,I rarely give 5 star ratings but this place was SO AMAZING   These guys nail a hot dog.  I m a bit of a hot dog conniseur with high expectations and these guys delivered.  Lets start with the bun...the most critical component to a great hot dog.  These guys fly them in fresh every day from a bakery in Tucscon that specializes in hot dog buns.  The toppings were fresh and the mayo was money.  And lets not forget about the dog great bold flavor and texture.    If you are from California or the west you are well acustomed to the disapointment that is Texican Mexican food.  FEAR NOT   This is legit mexican flavor and taste.  I lived in Mexico for a while and got addicted to their hot dogs and these guys replicate it perfectly.    The owner is awesome and is a true craftsman in his execution.  I LOVE the small menu.  They keep it simple and deliver awesome food every time   To the clown who posted a 1 star review on this place...give a real review.  If you are complaining about a  6 lunch you need to start cooking at home for yourself.    I m hoping they will open a downtown location so I can get my fix more often.  Can t wait to try the burrito as well.  Can only imagine how good that will be.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,381,This place is amazing  I m from Arizona and ever since moving to Austin I ve missed Sonoran style Mexican food - Tex Mex just doesn t compare  This is exactly what I was missing  The food is phenomenal - the Sonoran dog they re famous for is a MUST  Additionally the carne asada tacos are fantastic. Great service  friendly people  AMAZING food    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,382,This place has one of the best quesadillas ever  the owner was very attentive and very quick attending customers. My husband and I came here on a quick trip  but definitely coming back to this food truck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,383,If you know anything about food trucks in Austin then you know that most of them are amazing. This place is one of those places. This was by far the best hot dog I have ever eaten. The burrito was amazing as well. The price was a little high if you think of it as just an ordinary hot dog but well worth it once you start to eat. This is no ordinary hot dog. The staff was also amazingly helpful. It is a little hard to find unless you are looking for it but once you find the place you will defiantly be coming back for another bite.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,384,It was very different  The man was very nice and informative about the food  All super fresh and soo good   Definitely would come back again and recommend
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,385,Best hot dog ever. No seriously. I m not joking. You have to go all the way and get your Sonoran dog Con Todo. It s delish. I m a plain dog  amp  bun kinda gal  because I love the taste of a hot dog. I wasn t sure I d enjoy it Con Todo  but it s the only way to go. Toppings are just the right amount. Oh and the bunsyou could eat those just by themselves too. Owners are super friendly. Good food  good service  good ambience.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,386,I just tried the Sonora Dog yesterday and it was amazing. Interesting mix with the beans  bacon  hot dog  and jalapen  sauce. I can t wait to go back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,387,Delicious con todo hotdogs  Went with my girlfriend and brought my dog. Nice seating arrangements. It was clean and convenient  The hotdogs were worth the drive.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,388,T Loc  you blew my mind. I m speechless. This food is SO BOMB guys... we drove all the way from Killeen to try this food  WORTH IT. We are from Tucson  so our expectations were high. And man you went over and beyond  You need a truck in Tucson  you need a truck EVERYWHERE  Thank you for bringing a little bit of our home to Texas  I wish you the best 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,389,I  love this place. Great Hebrew national hot dog with beans celery mustard and tomatoes. Could not bring myself to get the mayo on a hot dog. The speciality drink was great. Watermelon   so good. I got a refill.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,390,One of the best hot dogs I ve ever had  Very friendly people as well  They use these special sweet buns that just tie it all together. Must try 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,391,Great food  never a let down. If you haven t eaten here   you are truly missing out. The hot dogs are the bomb   So good  I think I can enjoy 5 in one setting  I ordered 3 today. My gosh I still have that wonderful taste in my mouth.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,392,Location has moved to 2308 Hancock Drive. Tucson Locals was the bomb  The Sonoran Hot Dogs were terrific. Buns are brought in from Tucson are terrific. The new location is shady and spacious. Look for the blue UoA food truck and take a taste trip to Tucson 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,393,Really tasty hot dog via Arizona  the Sonoran hot dog is the way to go. Bacon wrapped enough said  Well they ve got more than bacon on the hot dog  get it fully loaded for a truly wonderful experienced in hot dog heaven 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,394,DAAAAMMMNNN    That s a good Hot Dog  I ve been craving a mexican hot dog for a long time now and this place NAILED IT  Do yourself a favor and come revel in this savory hot dog amazingness. I got the Sonora Hot Dog- Con Todo. Totally loving this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,395,The first time I came through here  the owner made me a great carne asada burrito with no frills but delicious  4 stars . I made the mistake of ordering the  11 steak fries on Friday night thinking they would be like the burrito . The crinkle cut fries were not crispy enough  the cheese was good but lacking  he 1 4 lb of steak seemed a lot less  coming from a mostly pescatarian eater  and overall it was very BLAND-not what I want from steak fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,396,Got the carne asada plate and it was SO good. Could eat here every day 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,397,T-Loc is such a rad dude and makes the meanest hot dogs. I go for the buns. The new location is much better than the old one on burnet. I recommend this truck to my friends often 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,398,This foodtruck is a one-trick pony and it s one trick is very polarizing. Either you ll love a Sonora Hot Dog and it s beans or you ll be meh. I m meh. It s really just not my thing. I might just not be a fan of this style of hot dog. I love plenty of other kinds.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,399,An excellent hot dog   Good service  other options  but this is a great dog....best with Mexican Coke 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,400,Pretty good hot dog  I was in Austin for a day and wanted something new. Glad I tried this food truck. I am ready to go back to Austin to try this place again. The customer service was also very good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,401,The dogs are amazing   I am contemplating another trip back to Austin just to eat here again  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,402,Came here just the other day to try out their sonoran dogs. They tasted exactly like the sonoran hot dogs in Tucson  AZ where I grew up  I think it s great that someone has brought the sonoran dogs to ATX. Miguel is from Tucson and knows what Tucsonians look for in their sonoran dogs  I look forward to coming back to this food truck in the near future. Enjoy   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,403,I like traditional hotdogs.  Steamed buns  chili  yellow mustard  onions.  But if you need a good hotdog this spot it tasty even if a little wacky.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,404,After hearing amazing things about this place  from more than one person  I decided to give this place a try. The food is amazing  and the owners are wonderful people. The carne asada burrito is delicious  but their staple item  the Sonoran hot dog  is where it s at  You ll never look at hot dogs the same way again  and that s a very good thing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,405,Just had an amazing hot dog at Sonora  Super fresh  slightly crispy dog wrapped in bacon with an awesome grilled bun and all the toppings. Owner was nice enough to get me a sample of the pineapple agua fresco and let me just say that I m not sure why anyone would ever drink anything else.   Can t wait for the new location as I m sure it will be a bit more shady and with less drive by traffic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,406,The Sonoran was absolutely delicious   Hit the spot after a day of hiking. They have moved to a nice shady little spot off Hancock.  Super nice and friendly 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,407,T-loc s was my first introduction to the Sonoran  veggie  hotdog when they were located a bit further north by Conscious Cravings  and now that they ve moved to the new Burnet Rd. food trailer park  I m even more excited  The owner and employees are super nice  and always remember us  even when it s been a while. The new location boasts plenty of seating  a play area for kids  and even more food trailer options if you have a diverse group who may not all want some t-loc s  though really  you should be convincing them to try it at least once . Oh  and try the fresh flavored water if they have it  you won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,408,I must have been to the wrong Sonora...their much touted special hot dog was Not. It was nothing beyond a small frank on a  non heated  regular bun. They added pico and bacon - but that doesn t make it special IMO. Highly AVERAGE 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,409,Honestly  I was hesitant the eat here because as a pescetarian  hot dogs are usually near the top the list of places to skip  but friends encouraged me to check it out. T-Loc s exceeded my expectations  I got the veggie dog with jalape o sauce and it was delicious   They use Smart Dogs for the veggie dog and the bread for the bun was fluffy and toasted to perfection. That little roasted pepper on the side sealed the deal  The hot dog game has officially been raised.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,410,As a self-proclaimed Foodie Snobby food critic  I have to say these hot dogs are the best I ve had.  Hands down.    My husband and I had lunch at T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs on Burnet.  Not only are the hot dogs insanely delicious  the owner was as personable as they come.  This truck is beyond worth coming back to.  If I can pull myself away from the hot dogs I ll try the burrito.  It looks amazing also 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,411,These are some of the best hot dogs I ve had  I m not big on hot dogs so that s saying a lot. Great service too. They ran out of the fresh fruit water when I showed up 30 mins before closing  but the owner said that their water is made fresh every morning and they have been running out. I m going back tomorrow just to try their water.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,412,I loves this place. Honestly  best hot dogs I ve ever had. I haven t had a single bad meal here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,413,This hotdog beats any other hotdog in the world. Chicago  New York bring it. You can t stand against this dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,414,What the hell  There should be a line of people here. Let s go people. Great after work stop in. Home made fresh fruit drink and quick great food. The couple who own run Sonora Hot Dogs is so sweet. Great simple food with a Sonora flair. Come before the place is discovered and the lines get long    I m back for a second time in less than a week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,415,At first I was a little worried about having mayo on my hot dog but decided to try something new. I have to say that this is the best hotdog I ve ever had  Totally worth visiting 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,416,Pure deliciousness. My wife is from Arizona and loves coming here any chance she can and as a New Mexican  I love this place as well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,417,A great food truck find with the friendliest owner  We had a Sonora hot dog-loved that it was wrapped in bacon and that the bun was so soft  the carne asada burrito with pico and guacamole  the beef quesadilla-their tortillas are so good  and the peach aqua fresca. We loved it all   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,418,Been there a couple times and the dude is total badass  both times he came over and chatted us up for a few minutes. He noticed I was speaking spanish with my fiancee and he busted out in all Spanish so props for that as well. Very attentive and really into his food and cooking you can see he has a passion for it. He also gave our dog Bobby some treats.   The hotdogs were excellent but dat burrito doe  Seriously just writing about it makes me want to go eat there. Good thing he s within walking distance.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,419,After the first time I ate here  I made a yelp account specifically to give Miguel and Zulma five stars.  This place is the best.    I stopped by yesterday for a quick and delicious dinner  and Miguel told me yelp wasn t giving my review much weight or something because I don t review enough places.  So I m writing another one just for Sonora Hot Dogs   My boyfriend and I have stopped by several times  and it s now one of our favorite places.  The owners seem like old friends now   We found out they got a review in the Chronicle  which was of course very positive - yay them   Anyway  in my last post I talked about how great the food is  and how happy I was to find it in Austin after having lived a while in Arizona.  This time  I have to rave about the aguas frescas.  I am a huge horchata fan and that s usually what I get here.  But the boyfriend is a  real  Mexican who loves cucumber.  I m a  fake  Mexican who doesn t - I actually kind of hate cucumbers.  But when Zulma offered a taste of her cucumber agua  I obliged.  To my happy surprise - It was delicious    So refreshing.  She does a great job getting creative with these drinks and I hope she continues to make the cucumber one   It tasted like the most refreshing mint lemonade-ish beverage imaginable.    As I told the owners  the only thing that could improve this place is carne asada fries     Keep up the great work and congrats on the growing business 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,420,To start off with the location is clean  warm and inviting. Plenty of parking in the lot or at the car wash next door. There are 3 large picnic tables for a nice outdoor eating experience. The owners Michael and his wife  offered a warm greeting as I walked up and were very friendly. I ordered my food which was an authentic  Sonora Hot Dog with everything on it. I was even offered a cold horchata while I waited. The horchata was delicious. After a few minutes wait my Sonora Hot Dog was ready and looked amazing. I think I had only a few bites in and had decided that I had to have another one. The combination of the bacon wrapped hot dog with the homemade specialty sauces and fresh chopped veggies on top in the specialty bun all come together in your mouth for a tasty delight. The second one did not disappoint me. It was just as awesome as the first. So if you are in the mood for the best hot dog experience ever stop by and pick up a few of these. I did not try the burrito but I plan on it my next trip to T Locs Sonora Hot Dogs.  I also noticed that they offer 3 types of hot dogs including a vegetarian hot dog for all of you vegetarians and vegans to enjoy. They also serve a variety of beverages including bottled cokes from mexico  horchata and coconut water.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,421,A co-worker of mine tried this place for the first time last week and was nice enough to bring me back an agua fresca. The flavor for that week was watermelon  and it was AMAZING  Im originally from El Paso and have not had any aguas frescas that compare to what I had back home  until I had theirs. It was exactly the way my mom and abuelita made it  a little bit of pulp and just the right amount of sweetness. They added some ribbons of fresh mint which I thought was the perfect compliment to this already refreshing drink. Yesterday  I took my fiance to finally try the food. We shared a burrito de carne asada and a hot dog  con todo.  The burrito was perfect.  Carne asada  guacamole  and pico de gallo wrapped in a thin flour tortilla. In my opinion  great Mexican cuisine follows a simple rule  a few simple but good quality ingredients orchestrated just right together provide the best flavors. The hot dog was also delicious  with just the right amount of toppings. I am not a ketchup lover myself and was overjoyed that the  con todo  hot dog did not include ketchup. The flavor of agua fresca I had was mango-also delicioso. Its great to see that they were using real fruit to make them  and not artificial flavors.  The couple was extremely nice  and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed their food so much. My fiance decided he want to try the quesadilla with carne asada  he eats like a horse and never seems to gain any weight . I had a bite and it was also delicious  crisp tortilla and gooey cheese on the inside. I m so glad this food truck opened up in Austin  and it s right down the street from where I work  And to think  my new found obsession all started from an agua fresca 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,422,Been trying to come for a couple of weeks  finally got a chance today. Got here and the people working were very polite  and even apologized for being closed the previous times we came. Totally worth the wait  these dogs are amazing  Had been wanting one since I saw this style on Man VS Food. Will be coming back more than a few times 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,423,Wow really good hot dogs.  I got the sonoran dog and it was really really good.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,424,Wow that carne asada burrito hit the spot. The Sonoran Style Hot dog had great flavor and I wanted seconds.  What I really needed was stretchy pants and someone to roll me out of there. The owner was really friendly and made it worth going back in the future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,425,I brought my husband today for his first Sonora hot dog. I had my first a couple of weeks ago  before the trailer moved to it s new location   it s hard to find  but it s basically in the parking lot directly across the street from Sonic on Burnet . These hot dogs are really good  and made fresh by the owner on the spot. It will not disappoint. I will be certainly going back  and maybe next time I ll try something else from the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,426,They forgot my tortilla  my food was cold and it did not taste as good as everyone said
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,427,How do you eat a hot dog anywhere else after having one from here  I love this place and so does my bank account   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,428,Great hot dog with lots of flavor. I should have gotten two. If you have a vegetarian in your party they can eat at the vegetarian stand next to this stand.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,429,This place is hard to park for when you are in a rush but the hotdogs themselves are worth the hassle. I need to give fellow yelpers a shoutout for their reviews too  this place is the real deal. I got the hotdog con todo and it was simply amazing. The Great Food Truck Race started my interest and yelpers only encouraged it more. Try it out  the staff is superfriendly too  make you feel welcome.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,430,I had the Con Todo the  regular  way and I must say it was awesome    I ve never had a hot dog prepared this way but it was really tasty.   I will check these guys out again and try some more things on the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,431,Good place  Owners are friendly and love what they do. I had the Sonora Hot Dog which was great. Then had a carne asada was better then most but this is hard to find in the ATX. So with that they come pretty close. The tamarindo agua fresca was just perfect  Service a 5  Hot dog a 4  burrito a 3  water a 4 so overall a 4.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,432,I ordered the Sonoran hot dog and also a burrito which I split with a friend.  The hot dog was good however I think the burrito was better. Owner was very friendly I definately recommend you try this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,433,I discovered what a Sonoran dog is while driving through Tucson two years ago  and have been talking about it since. This place is a great local spot to get your fix. Bacon-wrapped hot dog  beans  tomatoes  grilled jalapeno  a bun flown in from Tucson....  The staff owners are really friendly and the outdoor picnic tables allow you to eat it on site  i.e. get a second if you love the first one like I did.  For those with dinner companions who don t eat meat  the adjacent trailer specializes in healthy veggie options.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,434,Heard about this place online and you tube so  thought we would try it. Delicious   The hot dog was really tasty and the carne asada burrito was the deal. It all the right taste buds   Chef owner was incredibly sweet  friendly  and welcoming. Definitely would recommend this place and we will be back. It s a lil piece of Arizona in Atx  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,435,Born and raised in Austin and this is by far one of the best hotdogs I ve ever had here. Seriously. I didn t know a hotdog could be that good.   The atmosphere is awesome and laid back and Miguel treats you like family  I had their signature T-LOC Con Todo... Alright  I had two  but they re really that good... especially when you pair it with a Mandarin Jarritos and a bag of Fritos.   I d recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious meal if they re short on time. Or kickback and enjoy the picnic table setup. Either way  you won t be disappointed. I m glad these guys came to Austin  because they sure represent Tucson well   -  K 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,436,Best hot dogs in town with the best customer service  I always recommend this food truck to anyone who visits.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,437,this place is excellent.  run by friendly  competent people who have passion for what they do.  the sonoran dog con todo is sublime.  crispy yet juicy hot dog wrapped in bacon.   warm grilled bun roll.   every ingredient is perfectly conceived and place.   go here.  you will be addicted.   i love this food.   i won t eat a hot dog elsewhere.  best hot dog in austin.   thanks for bringing this to austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,438,WOW       Never had a hot dog quite like this- freaking awesome     Mayo on a hotdog  Wrapped in bacon  Yes please
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,439,Got the Sonora hot dog. It was so juicy and the buns tasted like donuts without the sweetness. The bun pretty much tasted like fried dough. And the guy was really nice  which is always a plus.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,440,I d say get the carne asada burrito or get the hotdogs wrapped with the bacon. The taste and flavor is so good. The tortillas are delicious and the buns are like a fluffy sleeping bag.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,441,This is now our favorite food truck in Austin. How do you choose between a hot dog or a burrito  You don t  you get one of each. My hot girlfriend and I each took a bite  looked at each other and said  yep.  Food is great  atmosphere is great  and the owner is great. We will come back often.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,442,Oh T-Loc s  where have you been my whole life  This ladies and gentlemen is their  con todo.  A bacon wrapped dog on a bed of beans  topped with sweet tomatoes and onions. With creamy mayo  mustard and  a jalape o sauce to boot. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink. They get their bread from their hometown of Albuquerque  I believe  can t recall if that s right  which adds a bit of sweetness. All balanced by a salted charred chile for a little heat. This is what a food truck is about  a small menu that they do right. Check it out  Food-gasm rant over.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,443,Easily the best hot dog I ve ever had. Hebrew National  Con Todos . From the bun to dog itself  unique and delicious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,444,New location....yelp address is wrong. Great space with Picnic benches. Had the Sonora dog which was great- best hot dog I ve had in a while  Good casual lunch or snack spot...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,445,OMG the best veggie hot dogs around. The bun is mouth-watering good. The only problem was I ate it too quickly and wanted another. Forget the calories and enjoy. Yum 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,446,My wife being from Tucson  these hotdogs taste just like the ones from Guero Canelo.  Had to buy several for my pregnant wife 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,447,Dang good dog.  Got it loaded and glad I did.  Fantastic flavors mingling together in hot dog heaven.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,448,Pretty tasty hot dog  Just wish they had a little more variety with the different hot dogs. Otherwise great and the staff was cool too  High five 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,449,Let me start by saying I m not much of a hot dog fan  but drive by here all the time so decided to give it a try. So glad I did  Hubs  amp  I both had a con todo  amp  split a cheese quesadilla. This was plenty of food  amp  we are not dainty eaters  The dog was great  amp  I loved the grilled pepper on the side. Plus our dogs got treats which is a nice touch. Owner was super friendly. We ll be back fo sho 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,450,You d be a fool not to try this place   I got two of the bacon wrapped dogs  and they were crazy good   Also  tried some fresh pineapple water that they had that was great  too.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,451,The Sonora hot dog is an Austin must try. So delicious. Best hot dog I ve ever had in terms of bread  weenie  and toppings. Their carne asada tacos are excellent too. Great prices. Main dude in charge is very nice and makes you feel like family. Excellent area too with lots of choices. Your new go to for indecisive groups wanting a taste of Austin cuisine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,452,Ok... just had to have my Hot Dawgg Fix... so I stopped by this littke  itty-bitty food truck  Sonora   Sonora style Street fare hot Dogs  the way the make em in Arizona   so I was educated by the Owner Mike  whom by the way was an Awesome cool guy along with his lady and partner Ms Zuma ... I am putting in adoption papers right now  because this 60 yr old Mama is gonna adopt  Best dogone dawgg I have had yet here in Austin  I swear I had Menage et toi Sex  with me  my mouth and hot dogs ...   NOT only was it devine Sex  it was  Orgazamic Sex  July flavorful and had so many yummy goodies that made me feel I was having a meal not a snack...i gulped down TWO....  KEEP it UP KIDS  LOVE... MOM 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,453,Staff is incredibly polite     The food is even better. Not a long wait     Loved it    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,454,The best Sonoran Dog I have ever had and I live in Tucson   My son moved to Austin earlier this year and we decided to stop by while visiting him for some home cooking.  We were not disappointed.  They were a bit pricy but worth every penny.  Next time I will have to try the burrito.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,455,Yes  the carne asada burrito really is THAT good  and the people who run the trailer are delightful. I ll be back  but don t know if I ll ever try the hot dogs  because the carne asada is divine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,456,If you ve never had a flat Arizona tortilla  you ve got to try this place out   Back story  My wife s family is from Tucson  AZ  and we have visited a few times. The Mexican food there is pretty amazing  although pretty different from Tex-Mex  which I love . The flour tortillas in Tucson tend to be big thin ones instead of the fluffy ones we see most often in Texas. This is the only place in town I ve seen use the Tucson style tortillas  and it s nice to get my fix.  Also  I like to judge my Mexican food joints based on bean and cheese tacos burritos. If you can t get your beans right  you re not the place for me.   So  going back to the review  I got the bean and cheese burrito with my Tucson style tortilla and it was delicious  The beans tasted great and had a nice consistency  the cheese was real cheese and not american style nacho cheese  and the tortilla was perfect. Very very good burrito. The only downside was the price - a bit steep for a simple burrito. But  I will be back. Looks like I need to try the hot dog next.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,457,I don t know if I went on an off day or not  but I found the Premium Sonoran con todo  to be a bit bland.  I was really looking forward to trying this famed dog.  It was just ok.  Too much mayonnaise  beans were bland and even the jalapeno sauce was bland.  The bacon and dog really didn t have too much sabor either.  The bun was soft  but in a way threw the whole dog totally over to the bland side. They were super busy when I was there  and forgot the grilled pepper as well. Were my taste buds just off   I don t know  but I m willing to give them another try some day.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,458,I love this place  His food is spot on to what you would come to expect from Sonoran style Mexican food  The burrito is perfect and the Sonoran dogs are amazing  I even love the charred chile     This should remind you of home  Tucsonans.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,459,I have been wanting to try one of these sonora dogs for a few years now.  When I passed by this place I got really excited and stopped by.  Pretty happy I did.  This dog  with everything  is pretty amazing.  I only really have a craving for a hot dog once in a while  but I would have one of these a week.  Very Good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,460,I had to try this hot dog truck with 5 stars.  I m not really a hot dog fan  but... these are worth going out of your way for   Order at least two  you will want another.  As a bonus  T-Loc is a really nice guy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,461,Great food and great service. It holds up to the food cart standard of being slightly overpriced and having servings slightly under sized. Though the buns are better  this place is outdone by Its competitor El Salchichon  off of Pleasant Valley. Granted  El Salchichon isn t perfect either - with its less than desirable location and its raging compressor noise but the bottom line is this puppy gives the nod to El Salchichon for bringing the heat and laying on the cheese. Don t get me wrong  if you are in the area give it a try 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,462,Yum yum yum     They know how to serve up a hot dog    And the service is fantastic. Really nice folks from Tucson. Try their homemade agua frescas.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,463,This was my first experience with this style of hot dog and I ll definitely be coming back. I m not completely sure what was on the dog I ate but it was quite tasty. The guy also gave me a free agua fresca because it was so hot and I had mustache sweat  I assume . Thanks guy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,464,Today  we finally broke free of cold grey weather that had blanketed Austin it seemed like for weeks. I m sure its only been a few day s but that s how Austin winter weather wimps feel  This day had glorious  Texas blue sky s and sun. Today would be my day to sit outside and reward myself with a Sonoran Hot dog  My only fear - would this dog live up to the hype in my head  As I had not read any yelp reviews.  Not only did it exceed my hype but it seems also the other 101 5 stars reviews here on yelp. Miguel Kaiser was a delighful and personable as could be. Order the dog all the way  trust the chef as each tasty element builds a mouth bomb of deliciousness. The grilled pepper along side the dog with a wash down of tamarind soda was a bingo. Stay Hungry My friend s and get on over here quick.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,465,The Sonoran Hot Dog  con todo  is the best dog in town   The owners are from Arizona and bring this style from the state if Sonora.   Super friendly service   Always good    I can t go back to a plain hotdog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,466,So yummy  I went to U of A and these are just as amazing as the originals in Tucson  maybe better. The bread is FedEx d in and unlike any other boring hot dog bun. The sauces are delicious and the whole dog tastes so fresh with all the toppings  Will be a 1x a week visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,467,I had never experienced a Sonora Hot Dog until last night... Simply amazing  I was blown away by how delicious it was. Only advice I d give for first timers... Get two  They were so good my boyfriend and I had both wished we d ordered another 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,468,The food here is tasty   My  Con Todo  hot dog was fresh  had plenty of flavor and didn t make me feel heavy afterwards. The couple running the food truck was very kind and enjoyable. I look forward to dragging my husband there soon    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,469,I don t even like hot dogs but they have a veggie dog that s amazing. The picture on the truck is exactly what the real thing looks like. The dog comes with layers of toppings and a grilled pepper that has just a little heat. The bun ingeniously prevents any drips and it s delicious too. There are also a bunch of other food trucks nearby  Gourdoughs is one   in a nice space where you ll want to sit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,470,The Sonora dog is excellent and reminiscent of the Guadalajara hot dog at Pink s in LA.  The owner  Miguel  is welcoming and knows his cuisine.  He s Cordon Bleu trained  and knows how to treat a customer.  Miguel has worked at the top of the culinary world  think Thomas Keller  yes that Thomas Keller  and has built a reputation for knowing how to put together an outstanding meal and his disciplined approach to meal preparation presentation.  I ended up ordering a second hot dog  because it was just that good.  Somehow  the crispy tomato and onions offset the bacon just right to make the Sonora a refreshing treat.  I m definitely coming here again.   I can t visit Miguel s food truck without ordering at least two Sonora dogs.  It s definitely among my local favorites in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,471,Uh.. As someone who had a true sonoran-style dog in Mexico.... For me  I think it s just an overrated hot dog place.. I was expecting their dog to be much bigger... but it is not. It s just too small for 5-6 bucks. However  the dog was not bad  that s why I had to give at least 3 stars. I hate to say this  but I d rather get 7 eleven s...which is much cheaper.. only  2  and you have a variety of topping selections.. japape os..onions whatever you want .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,472,Austin-ites YOU guys don t know what a gem you have in your own back yard    Family and I were visiting Austin and just noticed this place as we were exiting HEB across the street on Burnet Road.   The menu is short and simple but the food is GREAT    If you want a LIGHT meal then go for a Sonora Hot Dog  wife and grandma got one and loved it  and an agua fresca   Limeade and Horchata on this visit.   If you never had a sonora hot dog  please try its original format before you start taking away or adding toppings.  If you want to go away on a full satisfied tummy  then go for the burrito  It is perfect   Owner very nice and friendly and keeps a clean truck  Speaks English and Spanish. Takes cash and some credit card.   I know there is an army of food truck services out there in Austin and this one may not be listed on Austin s top ten list of food trucks  but hopefully it will make your list    Update June 13  2014  We were heading back home out of Austin and the wife had all the food options that we had already experienced  chain  mom n  pop  amp  other food trucks  but she decided on Sonora Hot Dogs   Plenty of shade to sit down and enjoy a great meal  Friendly  friendly owners   Granted I came back the next day  but was greeted as if it had been year 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,473,You think a hot dog is something just for Sunday afternoon  Don t be fooled. These are actually professionally trained chefs weaving together a sensory blend of never-forget flavors from a mass of ingredients. Great personality too.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,474,I can t stay away from this place   If you ve ever lived in SoCal and miss your carne asada burritos  this is the joint   The tortillas are exactly what you d expect from SoCal  too   They even wrap it in the traditional yellow paper   Go now 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,475,I m a Chicana from San Diego  CA  a.k.a. home of amazing carne asada burritos . Californians know a good place based on the quality of their carne asada  and this place definitely passes the test  I have lived in Austin for almost two years now  and T-Loc s is the first establishment that immediately delivered the taste of home. I highly recommend this place and I am excited to try the rest of the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,476,Best hot dogs ever  great agua fresca  and even better service   What more could you ask for   This place is awesome and their new location has a cute and shady outdoor seating area.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,477,I got the Sonora dog  regular  con todo .  That dog was so good and juicy  the bread was nice and fresh  and the beans and bacon and garnishes made this the best hot dog I ve had in Austin by far   We also tried the carne asada burrito  and all I can say is it was sick...in the best way.  The meat was juicy and well-seasoned with a good tortillas  and that s all it had.  It was simple and delicious because that was all a truly good burrito needs when the product is excellent quality. Sprinkle some salsa and lime on the side and you re good to go.  The agua fresca of strawberry was nice and refreshing and not syrupy.  Plus I got a free refill.  Also  the chef was really friendly and you can tell he takes pride in making his food taste great.  Definitely try to this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,478,Fist time to visit today and will not be my last.   The hotdog looks like a work of art and taste just as fancy.   The perfect amount of spice and sauce in between a fresh bun.   The service was friendly and fast.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,479,By far the best hotdogs of Austin. They are delicious.  They even bring the bread from Arizona to keep the taste authentic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,480,This place is hands down one of the best food trailers around. This husband wife duo are passionate  clean  and consistently on point. This is amazing food  everyone should have this unbelievable hot dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,481,Hot dogs on another level. This simple food truck is a welcomed addition to the diverse food scene off Burnet Rd. The service was fast and friendly and the veggie dog easily filled the hot-dog shaped hole in my heart. Vegetarian or not  you have got to try the veggie dog w  all the fixings fixing to fixins. Also  grab a refreshing Topo to wash it down.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,482,The owner is incredibly friendly  the food is super tasty  everything is as good as it gets. I love this place and I ll be back asap.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,483,I had my first Sonoran hot dog in Tucson  AZ and thought that I would never be able to have one unless I went back. When I first arrived in Austin  I was starving and immediately looked up the best food joints in the city. Sonora Hot Dogs came up first and I felt elated that I could fix my craving. The food truck is set up in cute location with a small parking lot  a few spaces   a tree covered eating area with picnic tables and umbrellas. The owner was incredibly nice and fun to interact with. The Sonoran hot dogs were perfect - just like Tucson. All of the flavors from the bread to the sauce were delightful. If you have never had one  I seriously recommend you take the opportunity because these hot dogs and the service are amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,484,I thought I died and went to heaven    Ate there twice on our 3 day visit to Austin. Burritos are amazing and the service is friendly and quick
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,485,Ok  I used to live in Sanora. One day at work I had a craving.  Need I say more   This place nailed it. Great  bun   great taste. Felt like I was back at the hot dog cart roadside in Nogales.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,486,I just happened by this food truck and was glad I did.  I went with the veggie option which can be hit or miss.  This was my first visit and it seemed like it took a long time to  which it does in comparison to a pedestrian street dog .  This is by no means a complaint as it was well worth the wait.  What you are given is an unusually flavorful treat with many flavors.  It was delicious and I will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,487,I can t wait to go back   My husband and I split the con todo and Carne Asada Burrito. Both were excellent. I don t eat hot dogs all too often but this was off the charts. I could eat here every day of the week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,488,We stopped in here because it was close by in burnet.  We were definitely surprised by how good this was.  Very fresh ingredients  and great tasting hot dog.  The owner was great to talk to.  Recommend you try this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,489,The best Hot dog ever. Try it one of my favorite places to go and eat. The sonora hot dog is one of a kind.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,490,Had heard lots of good things about this place and finally had a chance to try it today. I was not disappointed. Tried the premium Sonora Dog and it was delicious. As kind of an after thought I also tried the Carne Asada Burrito. Man  It was so good I almost ordered another. The picnic tables shaded by large trees made for a perfect outdoor setting - even in 90 degree weather. The staff were super friendly too. Made for a great all around experience. Definitely check this place out - and I m gonna keep my fingers crossed that they open up another location down south a little closer to my work.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,491,Wow  I m so impressed by this food truck  I had the Sonora style hotdog. The buns are shipped from Arizona. If you haven t eaten here  you re missing out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,492,Recently spent a month and a half in Austin  and this was one of my favorites. I was actually surprised with how delicious the hot dog was. It seems like a weird combination of items and condiments  but they all go together so well. The owners were extremely nice  gave us a bit of a background on the joint and the food they were cooking up. He told us they bring the buns in from Arizona since it s a specific kind you apparently can t get in Texas. Definitely worth it. If there was a food truck serving this up in Chicago  I d be there all the time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,493,Cheap  filling  and delicious. Perfect 3 3 for late night eating and in a prime location on Burnet. Great service as well too. The cook was very nice and even offered to bring my order to my car while I waited. Never had one of these dogs till today and i can honestly say i ll be back soon for another. Really interesting combination of flavors and would totally recommend this place to others.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,494,There are very few things good about Tucson  but one is the Sonora Hot Dog. We ve been in Austin a few years now from Phoenix and thankfully we d discovered T-Loc s.  Man is this a great hot dog   In fact it s so good I ll forgive the University of Arizona stickers on their trailer  Go Devils  . My lunch companion had a burrito too and said it was outstanding.  T-Loc  you put out a great dog...I ll be back...more than once 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,495,was passing thru texas heard about t-locs . got the asada quesadilla kinda bland also found what looked like a hair. wont be going back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,496,Had great expectations based on the positive reviews.   Sitting at a picnic table in the middle of a huge slab of concrete  SHD is right next to a car wash  just 10 yards from Burnet Rd isn t the greatest atmosphere esp if it s hot outside.  Not to mention this is right across the street from the HEB at Burnet  amp  Koenig so the traffic is heavy almost all the time.  But I didn t hit SHD to relax under a shade tree.  I came for the dog dawg.  SHD delivers a good quality dog on a good quality bun with good quality ingredients.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  All served with a postive attitude.  I was expecting to have my socks knocked off based on all the buzz.  The ingredients on the dog were creative but not anything you couldn t accomplish in the privacy of your own home for a lot less.  Wait time seemed kind of long too considering only one couple was in front of me  amp  I was ordering 2 dogs to go for us.  If I was the kind of guy to pay top dollar for car washes  amp  I was hanging out waiting for my car to get cleaned at this particular car wash  amp  I was craving a gut bomb SHD would be on my radar.  Since I m not that kind of guy  amp  don t go that way I wouldn t go out of my way for another SHD.  In other words if I was dropping  10- 15 bux on a car wash  amp  was stuck here I d be cool with dropping  5- 6 bux for a hot dog.  If that sounds like your bag then you will love this place.  Did I mention everyone working here at SHD was really friendly 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,497,Unbelievably good  and addictive   These hot dogs are absolutely delicious  and I could tell that they are made with top quality ingredients. If you like hot dogs  or even if you don t  get one of these 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,498,I ordered two premium hot dogs without bacon and an agua fresca de pina pineapple water . I paid about  15. That is the most I ve paid at a food truck. The food was decent and I would come back sooner if the hot dogs costed a little less.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,499,I m not a hot dog guy BUT these are amazing.  Other menu items are equally as amazeballs.  The owner is extremely cool and Wednesday nights are the best since the D amp D place is closed.  Check this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,500,After leaving U of A and moving to Austin  I ve been homesick for a good Sonoran dog. After a few lousy imitations I had low expectations here. T-Locs blew me away    the bread is right    Those of you from Tucson know what I mean  it was a classic sonoran  everything I ve missed since leaving tucson. Great find  An extra star for the A on the trailer - and theres an Amys right across the street for dessert
Veracruz All Natural,1,In a city of breakfast tacos  Veracruz rises above all others. It s a top 5 breakfast taco in the city.   Sincerely   A man who has eaten too many breakfast tacos
Veracruz All Natural,2,  5.5 out of 5 stars  Holy Moly Veracruz is a gem    My second time here in three days and my mind is blown even more this time by their migas taco.   We came to the park to get coffee from Desnudo  which is also a gem BTW. During our conversation  the Desnudo staff strongly recommended the two migas items  migas taco  amp  migas poblanas taco  from Veracruz. He also mentioned that Veracruz migas taco was listed as one of top 5 tacos in the US. So I decided to start with the migas original.   It is AMAZING    Packed with texture and flavor  the migas taco contains egg  tortilla chips  cheese  avocado  and vegetables. It was a feast by itself. When I saw the  5 price  I was surprised because it s definitely on the expensive end for a taco. However  the moment I saw the portion and had a bite   5 felt cheap.   Absolutely gonna try the migas poblanas soon 
Veracruz All Natural,3,I love tacos. When done right  they can be one of the simplest and most exciting bites in the culinary universe. But when they get over-complicated  it s easy to miss the mark.   The folks here were really kind and seem very passionate about what they do. I wanted to like these so much but they just felt a bit overstuffed  a bit overpriced  and didn t quite hit the spot.   I realize that some people like this style  and it may just not be for me. But we ve had street tacos  elevated tacos  and everything between  and these disappointed us. Austin has so many tried and true local places and we ll probably support those next time.
Veracruz All Natural,4,Veracruz is a staple for Austinites  they have several food trucks around town and a brick and mortar downtown.  Their menu has options for vegetarians and being a newbie vegetarian gal myself  I appreciated the fact that they had 3 vegetarian tacos on the menu.  Super fresh quality ingredients with amazing homemade salsas  I devoured the tacos I ordered. Highly recommend  you can t go wrong with them 
Veracruz All Natural,5,Stopped by to this small food truck park to get Veracruz taco with a friend and ordered all three vegetarian tacos on the menu. The tacos are potatoes-mushroom  el diferente   cauliflower  furioso   and egg white - mushroom  La Reyna .   I really liked the spiciness of the Furioso taco because of the saut ed cauliflower  carrots  corn  and avocado. The size is pretty good too  this was the taco I ordered with double tortilla because of the filling. This was my favorite taco of all three. It could get a bit messy while eating.   I found the egg white taco better than average and it reminded me of the breakfast tacos. Though the mushrooms were really surprising in this one and got along well with the egg texture. I think you ll need some spicy sauce to got with this one.   Finally  my least fav was the el diferente which is potato and mushroom taco. This seemed very low flavored for my taste buds as the potatoes and the beans didn t carry much flavor. So even after 2 pours of sauce on it  it wasn t really tasting very appealing to me. I d rather get 2 furioso then one furioso and one diferente.   Overall the ambience is good. The wait is pretty long for tacos  like 45 mins. So I recommend to order online before reaching here because even at the venue when the wait line get long they ask everyone to order online.
Veracruz All Natural,6,One of the best taco spots in Austin. A great menu full of different items  kind staff  and an easy ordering system. Every taco I ve had here is perfect. Their quesadilla is great too  And don t sleep on the vegan queso -- it s phenomenal  This review is simple  just like Veracruz...give it a try 
Veracruz All Natural,7,I think about these tacos sometimes and reminisce how amazing they were. Highly  highly recommend visiting this place for delicious tacos with the best meats  fresh tortilla       and toppings. The carne asada and al pastor were my favorite. I liked this location a lot because of the outdoor vibe and the colorful trailer.
Veracruz All Natural,8,Some of the best breakfast tacos in Austin  Our office orders from here every Friday morning and it never gets old  I always get the Migas or the El Sancho taco. The one downtown at The Line Hotel is in a great location and right by the lake 
Veracruz All Natural,9,Number 1 or number 2 of all the taco joints we visited  about 20 or so ... I thought every taco version I had here was at the very least a tie for the best I d ever had. I even include the taco joints in Mexico that we visited...  We tried almost every taco version on the menu. And my only regret is not trying the ones we missed.  Don t be like me- try them all.
Veracruz All Natural,10,Veracruz All Natural has a great selection of tacos  breakfast tacos  and smoothies. The food is inspired by the cuisine of the Mexican state of Veracruz. The branch at Congress Street always has a crazy line  so keep driving to this spacious spot in East Austin.  Grilled Steak Taco  The grilled steak is cut into little strips that are well seasoned and mouth watering. The taco is topped with cilantro  onions  elastic strips of creamy queso fresco  and slices of avocado. The green avocado salsa pairs well with this delicious taco.  Shrimp Macha Taco  The shrimp is sauteed in garlic and butter  and are cooked perfectly with a nice snap. The amount of shrimp that they stuff in the taco is astounding and mood enhancing. There is a layer of rice in the corn tortilla that is soft and dense with a texture similar to masa that readily absorbs flavors. The taco is covered with salsa macha  which is smoky  spicy  nutty  and insanely tasty. Green onions and avocado garnish the taco.   Ordering  Steep up to the platform and order your food and drinks. They ll text you when things are ready.   Dining  There s a large open space with lots of lunch tables with multiple food trucks at the edges.
Veracruz All Natural,11,Super solid taco spot. The tacos are excellent. The salsas are quite good  with spicy options available. The fresh juices and drinks are very refreshing.   The queso on the other hand is disgusting. Tacos are a bit on the pricier side for a food truck  but everything is pricier these days.
Veracruz All Natural,12,The best breakfast tacos in Austin  I always get the different versions of the migas tacos at this truck because they knock them out of the park. They are never soggy and are even on all of the ingredients so nothing overpowers the taste. The tacos are decent in size  filled pretty full  and are appropriately filling. Really 2 to 3 a person and you will be full. The green sauce is my favorite and not too hot   I love this location because they have a large semi fenced outdoor area by the truck and other food trucks with picnic tables with umbrellas to eat on. We ordered ahead on the website and only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Sunday morning from the order to get the fresh  hot tacos at the bus.
Veracruz All Natural,13,Best migas eggs in Austin  Texas no questions asked. So hearty I always have to take a nap after it. Their green sauce takes everything to the next level. I have frequented this location and they are consistent and the tacos are always of quality. I also love their agua frescas  they are absolutely scrumptious 
Veracruz All Natural,14,The photo might now look as much but try the Barbacoa taco. I wish they didn t wrap it in foil when dining in because it makes the photo less appealing.  But I want to suggest the barbacoa if you re a regular and a bit skeptical since where the meat comes from 
Veracruz All Natural,15,This place is a MUST if you re in Austin. I came here for breakfast tacos  and I was blown away at how delicious they were. Lots of great tacos to choose from. I also loved the whole outdoor dining and seating atmosphere. I also tried the mango Agua Fresca  not pictured  which was super delicious. Out of the tacos the el sancho was my favorite because the chorizo was extremely flavorful and not overpoweringly salty. Can we also talk about how cute their branding is  The menu  the stickers  etc. I loved that the stickers on the tacos actually list out all the ingredients  Highly recommend    Note  there is a long wait  up to 30 mins or so. But it s well worth the wait  I stopped by next door to grab coffee while I waited.
Veracruz All Natural,16,At Vera Cruz All Natural Restaurant. We tried the vegan queso  not worth it   guacamole  not good  and chips  was ok   kids quesadilla was good  El Diferente Taco without mushroom was good  Migas poblana and Furiosa Taco was not good. The best refreshing ones were the pineapple juice  freshly squeezed orange juice and Mr. Verde juice. The Flan was average.
Veracruz All Natural,17,This food truck came highly recommended and did not disappoint. It s located with its own private gated picnic area complete with picnic tables.   Tacos were the bomb  We ordered a slew of tacos- steak  chicken  shrimp  and grilled fish. They re a good size  all are deelish  but our fave was the shrimp. At least 4 large size juicy shrimp per taco accompanied with rice  avocado  and some kind of chipotle topping. Messy to eat  but super yummy    Ordered agua frescas to accompany the tacos. Fresh  fresh  fresh  Mango and watermelon. Large sized  blended with fresh fruit and containing pieces of fruit. Super refreshing.  I would definitely come back.
Veracruz All Natural,18,I came for breakfast tacos after doing way too much research on  best breakfast tacos in Austin.  So this is purely a review on the breakfast tacos.  All in all  it was a let down. When we got there  we were second in line  and they had an iPad to order from. So when it was our turn and we re ordering from the iPad  a worker comes to the window and is taking orders now. The iPad ordering takes forever  so the worker took like 4 orders from people behind us in the time we ordered from the iPad  which was annoying. I have an iPad and am well versed in technology  so it wasn t me being clueless  it s just slow like placing an online order.  Anyways. I got a migas taco and chorizo taco. Migas was decent  and the chorizo and egg was a total let down  no flavor at all. Thank god for the salsas which encouraged me to finish the meal.  The workers at the food truck were friendly and happily gave me extra salsa when I went up to ask for more.  I don t think breakfast tacos are that hard to make good. For sure harder to make very good  but just good  I wouldn t go back to this place unfortunately.
Veracruz All Natural,19,I have been several times but don t write many reviews..why ...I let the stars  talk for themselves...from the amazing customer service..All the food ...Bomb made scratch tortillas...I will say breakfast is still my favorite..that red sauce is smokin good ...Best part of this visit we had In Laws visiting from  Kansas   and needless to say they were blown away...thank you Veracruz for being you  
Veracruz All Natural,20,Came for lunch around 12 30 on a Wednesday. Not busy  Plenty of seating.   Had to wait awhile for the tacos but they were freshly made and individually wrapped with labeling stickers.  The el tradicional is a classic breakfast taco. Eggs were well seasoned and bacon added great flavor. Cheesy too  Really tasty on the corn tortilla.  Furioso is a cauliflower and veggie taco. I liked the flavors but wish the vegetables were cooked down a little rather than left as raw as they were. This was also the messiest taco.   The migas poblanas taco was a nice change of pace. Loved the peppers. I would recommend getting this on flour tortillas because the corn chips softened and in combo with my corn tortilla  it was a lot of corn tortilla flavor instead of the rest of the filling. Still a fun taco.  The red and green salsas are tasty and very different from each other.
Veracruz All Natural,21,I can t say enough good things about this place. We had some amazing tacos at this unassuming joint and the aguas frescas was just as amazing. We tried four different tacos and each one was a flavor bomb  The migas taco was awesome and my husband absolutely loved the Al pastor taco. Make sure you make it out to this area and try this place.
Veracruz All Natural,22,We woke up in Austin Texas  and felt a craving for a killer taco.    We found this place.    Trust me  just come try it.
Veracruz All Natural,23,Great picture worthy food truck with a nice outdoor seating area for eating with company. Their tacos are bigger than expected and I got very full. One breakfast taco could have held me over for a morning hike. Maybe blame it on me being half asleep  but the tacos didn t blow me away.   Got the breakfast  shrimp  fish  and mole. The star of the show was the fish  Perfectly seasoned and light. Should have ordered 4 of those. The mole was well flavored but not something I would order again. The breakfast taco is just that  a breakfast taco. Nothing fancy but does the job. Unfortunately the shrimp was too salty.   Make sure to grab the sauces on the table when getting your tacos. They re delicious 
Veracruz All Natural,24,A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet but a Veracruz taco at any other location would not taste as good. Somehow  someway the tacos at this location always tastes the best. The look and feel of the place of this location is also closest to the roots of Veracruz - as a simple food truck.   The Agua Fresca here is not to be missed  Pineapple is my personal go-to . My personal favorite tacos are the Al Pastor  Schrimp Macha and of course  The Migas they re famous for.
Veracruz All Natural,25,I love this place but is typically pretty long wait  recommend ordering to go and going to the window next to the congress bridge rather than go inside.   Ordered barbacoa breakfast taco and while delicious  was pretty oily   Has outdoor seating
Veracruz All Natural,26,Been here twice in the last two week  and I cannot find one thing negative to say... I tried their Mr. Verde drink and it was so very refreshing.  So far the favorite taco is the shrimp Macha.  2 thumbs up
Veracruz All Natural,27,I came here wanting to try breakfast tacos in Texas. These tacos did not live up to what I had expected a delicious breakfast taco to taste like.  First off we waited at least 45 min for our 4 tacos at 8 30 am. They were fresh when we received them  but for ordering off a taco truck  I was very surprised to find the wait time so long  especially when there were about 4 people before us . Where I live  tacos from a food truck are ready within 5-10 minutes...   Anyways  the flavor department was definitely lacking in these tacos. I tried the Migas poblanos  which was probably my favorite  el tradicional  el diferente  and the Al pastor. The Al pastor was not what I would consider normal al pastor. The seasoning seemed off and definitely different  in a bad way. If you re alright with bland tacos  this might be for you  as the tacos and ingredients did seem to fresh.
Veracruz All Natural,28,This place was legit  Awesome little area with a couple other food trucks. Tacos are great  but the chips and guac stole the show. Best part about the meal and that s saying a lot because the steak and al pastor tacos were some of the best tacos I ve ever had.
Veracruz All Natural,29,I spent a little bit of time living on the Mexican border  but these are some of the best tacos I ve ever had.  Hit Veracruz late AM for some breakfast tacos and went for the migas taco and the migas poblanos taco  as per the recommendations of most all other reviews and websites I ve seen that tout them as some of the best. Was not disappointed. Cooked super fresh in the truck with phenomenal flavor and ingredients  I can t recommend them enough  because who doesn t love breakfast tacos. As you can see by the attached photos  the tacos aren t the prettiest to look at  but you can t judge these books by their covers.  This particular location is in a little park type area with benches surrounded by independent vendors selling their miscellaneous products  this was on a Saturday  not sure if that s the usual .  Go here if you want to get your taste bud s day started off with a bang.
Veracruz All Natural,30,I didn t think tacos for lunch could ever take 2 hours to enjoy. We arrived just before noon on July 5th. It was raining and we stood outside in line for about an hour. Many people left the line  moving us closer to the front  but it was a very very slow moving experience.  We finally got to the front of the line and I ordered  chips  queso  salsa  and 3 tacos  chicken mole  al pastor  and the vegan taco.   30 minutes later  our tacos are ready.  Their mole is delicious. I m glad I got to try it on two. The chicken was ok. It was a little dry. The vegan one was the best one of all. The al pastor was dry and crunchy  which we all found weird. Everyone in my group got one of those. It was the one we all equally hated. Every element of the taco was dry and crunchy.    This wasn t a good experience. I felt like I should give the restaurant grace because it was a holiday and maybe they didn t plan for the masses of people  but then I spoke to my doctor about it right afterward. She also said that she doesn t go here because it s too slow  so I suppose it s what s expected and I just didn t know until I experienced it.   Making the all the meats  salsas  and moles are time consuming arduous tasks  but assembling tacos is fairly fast. I don t know why this took over 2 hours from start to finish. Luckily friends were visiting and we were happy to use that wait time to catch up.  My favorite was the vegan mole taco and my friends  favorite was the chorizo. Enjoy 
Veracruz All Natural,31,If you re looking for some solid tacos in Austin  search no more    There are a few Veracruz locations throughout the city  but my friends and I stopped here for some quick food on the way to meet up with the rest of our group. We arrived about 40 minutes before they closed  were able to order pretty quickly. Veracruz uses the electronic buzzers to alert folks when their orders are ready  so it reduces any accidents around missing when their food is called out. The location in general is a great vibe  and the school bus is quite an aesthetic.   The menu is straightforward and there are some solid options  The folks inside the bus are really helpful with making good recommendations  especially around tortilla selection for the various tacos. You really can t go wrong with any tacos  just pick based on your interests  I d recommend getting 3 tacos if you re looking for a standard meal. Their drinks are also fantastic    The outdoor seating is great  and there are fans which are always appreciated in the Texas heat. One caveat... the flies in this area were awful for some reason. Not sure if it is where Veracruz is located  or if it was just the day we were there  but we  could not  get the flies to leave us alone  As a result  it turned into a mad dash to finish eating as soon as possible  which did detract from the eating experience. Additionally  it took 25-30 minutes for us to get our orders which was a little disappointing as well  since there were only a couple of other folks getting orders ahead of us.   Overall  I d say Veracruz is definitely worth a try  especially if you re looking to get some food and head to another location .
Veracruz All Natural,32,I had high expectations for this place. I thought the tacos were just ok. To be honest I thought the tacos were a bit bland. Maybe I came on an off day. I did enjoy the fresh juice  it was a refreshing and not watered down.
Veracruz All Natural,33,Best tacos we ve tried in the Austin area. And the seating situation  with large trees providing shade as well as the charming tables with high top seats  etc.  Our only criticism was no alcohol license and man  a cold beer would ve been a great accompaniment to those amazing tacos  Get the Agua Fresca instead. So good  
Veracruz All Natural,34,Delicious breakfast tacos  I went on a Monday and there was little wait. You have to order the Migas taco. It was my favorite. And their salsa is delicious too with a kick.
Veracruz All Natural,35,Within minutes of the airport  these tacos are the real deal. The corn tortillas are handmade and the taco selection is extensive. We went with an el diferente  barbacoa  steak  and a macha shrimp. None of which disappointed. Do yourself a favor and run to these tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,36,If I could just tell you what these tacos mean to me maybe you could understand. You must eat them. They re just the best in town  they just are. Consistent all the way around. Yes there s a line get over it. They are what I live for every weekend. Sometimes the east side one has this market saturdays with a live Latin music dj which is cool .
Veracruz All Natural,37,Love their tacos  The wait can be a little long but trust me it s worth the wait  Their cashew queso is pretty tasty too 
Veracruz All Natural,38,Fantastic tacos. Some of THE absolute best in Austin - hands down. Service is friendly  honest and upfront about wait time and they  work to get order completed for you as soon as possible. I ve had chicken and veggies tacos here as well as chips and queso. All of them were delicious. Love that it s a food truck with lots of space to sit and shade for hot days.
Veracruz All Natural,39,Funny place  you pull up to this little park and there are like 5 different trailers you can order all different things from but I m assuming owned by the same group. All the food is bomb. I m use to street tacos in LA which you can eat in 2-3 bites. These tacos are A LOT bigger.   Pro-tip - get an agua fresca and mix flavors.   I went when it had recently rained and all the seating and tables were wet so you may need to grab extra napkins to dry stuff off.
Veracruz All Natural,40,So many vegetarian options. Super friendly. The one with lots of veggies wasn t my fav but the potato and egg frito one was amazing. Would recommend. More expensive than other taco places but I love. Juice was pretty good too.
Veracruz All Natural,41,Couldn t leave Austin without grabbing some breakfast tacos  This location was close to our airbnb and I had heard good things about this business. We grabbed 4 tacos and waited a picnic table on a chilly morning. They stay pretty busy between people walking up to order and people placing orders ahead of time. We probably waited about 15 minutes. There was a coffee place around the corner we could ve walked to or we could ve tried one of their juices  but we just waited for our tacos. They came out warm and wrapped in foil  perfectly labeled which I thought was really great  Nothing is worse than having to open a taco and look at what s inside to determine who s it is. I don t remember all the tacos we got but I do know we enjoyed them all  I do remember I got the Migas and that was really good  They have coolers with 2 different salsas for you to grab as you need which is convenient. This is a great place for a quick affordable and delicious breakfast. If you re in a pinch be sure to order ahead of time 
Veracruz All Natural,42,Huge tacos with all the flavor  The chips and salsa should be free for dine in tbh. But it s nice that you can order and sit by the pool if you re a guest.
Veracruz All Natural,43,My favorite place to get tacos  I visit Austin every other month or so and Veracruz is always my first stop for tacos and queso.
Veracruz All Natural,44,Well today was our second visit  My husband who is the self proclaimed  barbacoa connoisseur of Texas   Said that it was the very best he has ever had  Believe me he is a big boy and loves barbacoa     From Brownsville to Amarillo and everything in between   
Veracruz All Natural,45,THIS PLACE IS EVERYTHING    best location too... such a vibe and gave me total Austin  TX sense of how awesome the community is  WARNING  you will wait a LONG time even during off peak hours...  local friends brought us here and it had an awesome vibe with Veracruz tacos AND fresh drinks  plus a little random empanada truck with lots of outdoor seating for all types of occasions  upon arrival we ordered the tacos around 1 40pm and received them at 2 15pm... between then we ordered drinks at the verzcruz drink truck  you can also order at the taco truck   and we found a seat  waited and enjoyed   THE ORDER  -watermelon fresca  22oz though I think frescas come bigger than standard 22oz -  7.50  - listen to the reviews and the staff  they will recommend this drink. IT IS SO REFRESHING and blows every fresca ive had out the window. omg... it was so refreshing on a hot day - perfectly sweet  not overly  and comes with so much. they only have one size per the person taking our order for frescas even though their menu has two sizes  -pink panther smoothie  22oz -  7.50  - orange juice  strawberry  banana  mango... look I dont know what happened here but in theory it sounded like a sweet refreshing drink but turned out to taste very  healthy  LOL and other smoothies friends had also taste healthy and less sweet. just an FYI - still solid  but not my cup of tea  -al pastor  corn -  4.25  - GET - delicious and one of my favorites out of the 5. could appreciate a bit more pineapple and onion but it was bomb   -la reyna  flour -  4.25  - meh  I d skip this one. vegetarian which is a great option  but it was TOO much veggies even my boyfriend who loves healthy things said it was too much. comes with egg  mushroom  carrot  spinach  cilantro  onion  bell peppers  cheese  and avocado  -migas poblanas  corn -  4.25  - another vegetarian taco  but id recommend this over the la reyna  comes with egg  tortilla chips  peppers  onion  black beans  quest fresco  and avocado - this combination gave different flavors that went well together. I surprisingly enjoyed it.  -shrimp macha  flour -  5.25  - BOMB  but warning the salsa will have you sweating if you don t do well with heat. recommend  shrimp was cooked perfectly and was overall together great with the ingredients   -migas originales  corn -  3.75 . BOMB - must get. great  breakfast  type taco... but good for lunch dinner too. everything went really well together and is also vegetarian.... do it   PROS  -delicious food -BIG taco and drink serving sizes -loved the straws  agave.... no paper wilting  -had some chips and they had a very unique crispy texture -total vibe  decorations  different seating  lights  etc.   CONS  -long wait - I waited 30 minutes -the smoothies aren t your average sweet fruit smoothies... taste very  healthy   OVERALL  go here  you won t regret it 
Veracruz All Natural,46,THE BEST TACOS IN AUSTIN  I know I m no local  but I made it my mission while I was here for the weekend to eat all the tacos  and these were the BEST for sure - entire group agreed. All tacos were stuffed generously  seasoned to perfection  and fresh as hell. Super long line wait time  so make sure to order online or plan for a wait time. Extremely fresh ingredients too  But...BEWARE  hot sauce is SO hot.
Veracruz All Natural,47,Excellent food and great folks. Got here early on a Thursday morning with no line and quick service. Try the El Traditional for that Austin style breakfast taco that hits the spot.
Veracruz All Natural,48,Really enjoyed dinner here. Two corn tortilla tacos with vegan fillings. I was expecting the Furioso to be spicier but it was good. The chips and salsa was my favorite - the chips were thick and the salsa was really flavorful. The best was the hibiscus drink which I order everywhere I go. Sometimes at other places the hibiscus flavor is stale or it s too much ice and the drink is gone in two sips -- not this one   Not only is this one delicious  you get a giant cup of it     The order system and pick up went smoothly.  Sat at the picnic table under the tree. Super great.   Garbage and recycling bins available.  Dog friendly. There is a small station with dog waste bags and bin. So the place was very clean.
Veracruz All Natural,49,If 3.5 were an option that s what I would give it  It s tasty food with a long list to pick from  The service isn t super fast and it wasn t outstanding for tacos in Texas  The barbacoa was really good but left me feeling a bit sick. I got the vegan option with retried black beans  the mole chicken one  barbacoa  and grilled chicken  I liked the grilled chicken best  then barbacoa  then mole  then black beans because that one was too spicy to bear for me personally. It s a really cute atmosphere and tasty so I wouldn t not recommend it because it is a nice Austin experience but it is not the top of my list for food in Austin IMO.
Veracruz All Natural,50,Wonderful  with not tonnes of toppings  and you can actually taste the meat. My fav was al pastor  so juicy and delicious. They take cards and food came very quickly.
Veracruz All Natural,51,Good food and drinks and the ambience is nice as well. It s a nice spot  would recommend.
Veracruz All Natural,52,I m sure many have heard of Veracruz  one of Austin s most popular taco spots in town. They have a few locations around town and have a robust menu that is sure to satisfy all taste preferences   The taco here that surprised me most was their Shrimp Macha Taco. Macha is a nutty  smokey salsa and when paired with the butter  amp  garlic shrimp and avocado it makes for a great contrast of flavors    5.25   Another great one is their Grilled Steak Taco. What I like about it is that the beef has a lot of flavor  It s tender too.   4.25   The last one I ve tried is their Grilled Chicken Taco. There was nothing particularly different about it  but it still tasted good.   4.25   All in all  they re a great spot to visit and I give them a 4 5  I definitely suggest you try the shrimp macha taco.
Veracruz All Natural,53,The tacos are good but their fajita meat was overcooked. Took 25 mins to prepare our tacos. Still great environment to grab some tacos. Also  some of the pictures here are not accurate. They don t have anything other than tacos and juice.
Veracruz All Natural,54,SO GOOD  We are going to have to fight the urge to just come back here on our last day in town instead of trying the rest of the places I have marked.   The staff was very friendly and orders came out quickly. The free salsas are all great and the area is very cute. Lots of picnic tables for seating and easy street parking. We had never been before and asked her to help us pick a sampling of tacos and we re not disappointed at all.   The Migas poblano  el traditional  and fish were some of the favorites. Highly recommend you stop by 
Veracruz All Natural,55,Great Tacos...a step above  We would put these tacos up against any in the Austin area for quality and taste. Note  We went to the Windsor location for lunch. I ordered 4 different Tacos so my wife and I to give this eatery a holistic test. Each taco blew us away  I ordered the following  El differente Taco  veggie option   a Fish Taco  a Carnitas Taco and a Chicken Taco. All tacos were seasoned well with a generous amount of avocado and other fillings on each taco . The tortillas  corn and flour  were very good as well.  These tacos are made with very good ingredients and you won t remember you ate them a few hours later  if you know what I mean.  Fresh  Fresh  Fresh  ....so  run don t walk to this exemplary taqueria.
Veracruz All Natural,56,I had the grilled fish taco  the migas and the mango agua fresca and they were all really good  I would highly suggest the grilled fish taco  it was slightly salty for me but their agua fresca made up for it it was sweet but not too sweet and you could taste the fruit in it. The line was pretty long and the food took 20 min to make but the wait was worth it 
Veracruz All Natural,57,Best tacos we ever had . This place has great vibes and super great food. They also have a juice bar. There are 2 more trucks in that space . It was a great experience .
Veracruz All Natural,58,They re currently doing all their ordering online which makes it easy to order before you get there  or you can just scan the QR code and order when you get there. The migas breakfast taco is so yummy and filling  you really only need one  but definitely get the double tortilla   I crave their chips and guac  The chips are super crunchy and the guac is chunky which to me is the perfect pairing. Definitely worth getting as a side or even to take home and enjoy later.
Veracruz All Natural,59,Veracruz has the BEST taco in Austin... the migas. We ve tried a loooot of tacos here and that s the best. I don t even get anything else anymore. I don t love that they often have odd hours and at several locations you can t order in person. Most of the time the wait is extremely long too  especially for a small order of tacos... . That being said  if you order ahead online and then go pick up  it s worth the hassle.
Veracruz All Natural,60,I used to eat here all the time.    So many businesses not accepting cash.  It has been over two years since I quit eating here. I ve heard of many people  doing the same.  Makes no sense not to accept all forms of payment.
Veracruz All Natural,61,Amazing tacos - the best I ve had in Austin all weekend long. I could go here everyday and be happy. I got the migas and traditional with chorizo  yummmm. The green juice was great too 
Veracruz All Natural,62,It was ok. Not sure why you would need 30-35 minutes for three tacos when there is no line. Tried the barbacoa  al pastor and migas. The barbacoa was 8 10 so I would recommend. Tacos are small and expensive. The mango agua fresa was good. What made the trip was the empanada stand next door which I ll write a review for too lol
Veracruz All Natural,63,I ve been a customer of Veracruz for about 6 or 7 years and I m sad to say it s gotten very hit or miss in the past year specifically. The tacos are sometimes bland or missing ingredients. Today I waited 35 minutes for an order of chips and salsa. The salsa keeps getting more expensive but the container gets smaller and smaller.   I m very sorry to be leaving this review  and I hope to see them improve. This used to be one of my favorite spots.
Veracruz All Natural,64,The best breakfast tacos in town  I always get the El Sancho taco and it never disappoints  I could rave about it all day. I also just recently tried their watermelon agua fresca and it was so delicious  I ve been to multiple locations too and each one has a great ambiance and fantastic staff. I will always recommend this place to anyone who is visiting 
Veracruz All Natural,65,Omg. Yum. I ve heard a lot about this place and finally came and it lived up to the hype. We had to wait about 20 mins which was fine despite how cold and windy it was haha -- no Veracruz s fault. I ordered a migas and an el sancho and 100  will order them again. Go here
Veracruz All Natural,66,This is a great spot on a nice day.  The portions are very generous and priced well for what you get.  I had the grilled steak taco and was surprised by how jam-packed it was. Everything was seasoned well. Also ordered the salsa and loved the chunks of avocado in it. The tortilla chips are also next-level. They have heft and hold up well  not like those flimsy store-bought tortilla chips.   Veracruz definitely tops the list of tacos in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,67,Wow tried every taco all were amazing   Favorites were shrimp and pastor   This place is a must visit 
Veracruz All Natural,68,I ve been meaning to revisit Veracruz because I feel like I gave them an unfair shot last time. This time around  I loved it  Their tacos are delicious. I got the Al Pastor  Shrimp  and the two types of Migas. My favorite was the Migas Originales  The Al Pastor was also amazing - the pineapple really does it.   The only downside about this place is that the tacos took a whopping 45 minutes to come out because they were having issues with their ordering system  written during COVID times . They had us place our orders through their website even while we were at the physical location. The wait was insane so hopefully they fix this issue soon because I d love to come back here regularly 
Veracruz All Natural,69,What a great start of your day  You can get anything you might wish for breakfast in Austin. The amazing Veracruz breakfast tacos and some coffee from Fleet caf . Smoothies are also delicious. You should give this a try. If you are rushing  this might not be the ideal place for you  tacos are prepared fresh specially for you and take a little while to prepare  so be patient  it s worth it 
Veracruz All Natural,70,Bruh. Over AN HOUR wait for tacos and an horchata  which was way too sweet  Tacos were pretty good. But damn.   The system they have in place is absolutely ridiculous. We did not know they ONLY took online orders walking up.... We said  oh ok. no prob  lemme put that in right now . Email notification comes through saying  45 MINUTES until your order is ready . WHAT  as we laugh   can it be true  ....    YUP. Sure the fuck is. Beware of this. Hopefully this is eliminated soon  but no telling. Def going to order 3 weeks in advance if I ever go back.    Hey Veracruz  I d put several big ass SIGNS letting customers know it s only online ordering and HOW LONG it ll be  in big red lettering. This will prevent cancelations and refunds.
Veracruz All Natural,71,Stopped by today and got a couple of tacos and a quesadilla. Some of my favorite street tacos were from SoCal but these are by far the best tacos I ve ever had  Both of the sauces they give you to put on it were also very good  Definitely saving this spot for the future. Location was cute too
Veracruz All Natural,72,The quest was disgusting   It didn t taste anything like queso   I bought chips and salsa along with 4oz of flaun for  18   The flaun was good but the rest was so disappointing.  I know it s locally owned but ... never gain.
Veracruz All Natural,73,10 10 outdoor seating. I ve felt the safest eating out at this restaurant compared to any other. The Migas Originales taco was incredible  really enjoyed how thickly they cut the avocado slice bc some places can get skimpy w it. Not the best value of taco  granny s taco still got this place beat  but very delicious none-the-less. Had a bite of the shrimp taco and it was good too  kinda too spicy if you re weak like me.
Veracruz All Natural,74,Spent one weekend in Austin and I m pretty sure I made a point to go here every day. This will be my first stop on my next trip without a doubt. The shrimp one was my absolute favorite - has a really nice smoky element to it.  The hot sauces are also actually hot and flavorful as well - the perfect combo for a spice enthusiast. The juices have a lot of sugar in them though so watch out for that
Veracruz All Natural,75,A must in any Austin taco crawl  I would definitely try the flour tortillas here  they re thicker and have the perfect amount of chew to complement any filling. The Al Pastor taco has a unique spice blend that makes a traditional taco really interesting. Each piece of pork was fatty and rich  and the whole taco was packed with flavor  no salsa needed  Every ingredient in the Migas taco is incredibly soft. From the eggs to the flour tortilla  the entire taco is extremely fluffy and light.
Veracruz All Natural,76,Absolutely the best tacos in Austin. Agua Frescas at the east side location at so delicious I always get one. The vegan queso is SO good - great consistency  taste  and texture. I love this place and take everyone that visits me here 
Veracruz All Natural,77,Went after hearing its  Number 1 Tacos in Austin  title. Make sure to get their famous migas tacos. It is one of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had and lives up to the name. They don t do any crazy fusion tacos like other restaurants but perfect the traditional dish.  After ordering  they give you a buzzer which notifies you to pick up your order. Everything is made fresh so expect to wait 10-15 minutes for a small order.  A minor point- their smoothies are mediocre but I will let it slide because their tacos are superb.
Veracruz All Natural,78,Solid breakfast burrito  Order ahead of you can. Salsa is so friggin good. We got the classic with eggs  Bacon  potatoes  cheese. Tortillas were good. We ll be back. Next time we ll try the ones rec d by other Yelpers.
Veracruz All Natural,79,The best breakfast tacos we had during our short stay in Austin. A little pricey but worth it
Veracruz All Natural,80,Migas Migas Migas   Heard so much about this taco truck and I am damn glad I made the trek to the new location on a pretty drizzly Monday morning. But the rain was no bother when I got there  as the picnic area has plenty of umbrella covered spots. And  I mean...the tacos are worth the weather alone  So  with a Terry Black s visit planned later that day  I opted for the 2 tacos  the Migas Poblanas and the Fajita Steak.  Fajita Steak - served with cilantro  onion  queso fresco  and avocado.  I know it sounds simple  but it s perfectly-well excited  and when you slather it in some of their green sauce...glory.  Migas Poblanas - served with egg  tortilla chips  poblano peppers  red onion  queso fresco  black beans  and avocado - holy mother of god where has this been my whole life  While I was worried I m miss a meat-protein in the dish  wow...all the flavors just melded so well into pure bliss. And the tortilla chips add an amazing textural contrast...just so good. Winner winner.  Veracruz was easily the cheapest meal I had in Austin  but it was also easily one of the best meals I had in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,81,It was good but the chips could have been better but overall good I love the energy of the park
Veracruz All Natural,82,4 Stars for fabulous Migas breakfast tacos  but I d give the chips and guac a skip    We grabbed a Lyft from our hotel to find this gem we found on Yelp and we were not disappointed  It s a food truck that appears to be permanently parked in this location.   We went for a very late breakfast so we didn t experience a line or any wait to find a spot at a picnic table. Right away I appreciated the shaded picnic table area. That Texas sun can get verryyyy real  Just a word to the wise-- watch out for the birds  They re very curious  mostly about ways they can grab that taco while you go to get some salsa .  We started with the chips and guac. The chips were really nice and crispy- obviously made in-house  in-truck  . The one thing my partner and I both noticed is the lack of salt. Or any seasoning for that matter. Both the chips and the guacamole would have been really good with some salt.  As for the tacos  I couldn t complain about my very first experience with Migas tacos. It was filled with scrambled eggs  black beans  some avocado  tortilla chips  and queso fresco. Crunchy  flavorful  and a definite great start to my Migas taco journey around Austin.  I also got the al pastor taco  which was equally delicious. What sets it apart  of course  is the sweet surprise in every few bites. Love me some hidden pineapple   The one big bummer was that they didn t have any juices  aquas frescas  or smoothies available. Maybe they had a big rush before us and ran out  But they only had bottles of water or coke. Again  a bummer...  Overall  a great little detour for some great food.
Veracruz All Natural,83,This location is a food truck with a little patio carved out right off a Caesar Chavez. There is a parking lot out front but the paving isn t finished and there are huge potholes so be wary.  The breakfast tacos are definitely popular so expect a bit of a line even if it s early. I was a little confused at first as to why they needed a name and phone number at the time of payment but it s because they send you a text message when your food is ready  No more standing around the truck. It made for a way better experience when waiting in line to order and being able to sit and enjoy the patio while waiting for your food.  I had the migas originales breakfast tacos. I had a choice of corn or flour tortillas and when I asked the gentleman taking my order for his recommendation  he suggested flour so I went with that. Apparently they make their corn tortillas in house and the flour is locally sourced. I definitely recommend getting 2 at a minimum to feel full. We also had chips and guac to share for the table. The chips were thick and crunchy. Just perfect the guac. A good start to the morning 
Veracruz All Natural,84,Awesome breakfast tacos and great outdoor atmosphere makes this one of the better places in Austin to grab a taco. Always goo and they make their own tortillas. There is also a coffee truck there as well.
Veracruz All Natural,85,Came here with a friend for the first time on an early Saturday morning and it was just soooo relaxing. It almost feels like its own little pocket  like just sit and eat with your good company and everything will be alright lol. I like that the food trucks are surrounding the picnic tables and chairs that are in the middle  but with just enough distance so that it does not feel crowded. Because we went around 9 30am  we definitely beat the crowd and got a nice table right in front of Veracruz. I got their speciality taco  the  Migas Originales   an order of their chips and guac  and an  Agua Fresca  mango-flavored. All of it was super yummy and tasted low-key homemade  which I love. The only thing I don t like is that they are way overpriced. Parking might be a bit hard to find  but my friend and I scored a spot right in front of the place. Go  go  go if you haven t. It s a definite Austin-famous spot and rightfully overhyped.
Veracruz All Natural,86,MIGAS POBLANOS  5 5  all the way. Delicious in-house corn tortillas   MIGAS ORIGINALES  5 5  also delicious  although I did enjoy the MIGAS poblanos a bit more  FISH TACO  3.5 5  I got it with a flour tortilla based on another YELP recc which was spot on since the flour tortilla held up really well. Overall  it tasted very fresh but the tilapia didn t seem to fit. Maybe if it was mahi mahi or another neutral white fish it would ve been better   CHICKEN TACO  5 5  simple in the best ways. Flavorful  nice balance of salsas  not doing much. Tasty without being drowned in a lot of sauce  like they do at Tacodeli . Perfect on a corn tortilla.   Definitely prefer this spot over Taco Deli. The smaller menu at Veracruz allows them to do what they do really well.  NOTE  THEY WILL BE MOVING FROM THIS LOCATION TO ANOTHER ONE IN APRIL 2020 check their website for location details     a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.veracruzallnatural.com amp s 6d08505a04890d3d072370f0f798c3ff3355a2a121b701cce99ab233e140f497  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  veracruzallnatural.com  a 
Veracruz All Natural,87,The seating area around the food truck is really cute  The queso chips were pretty good too but the tacos are absolutely amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,88,If you are looking for great tacos for breakfast or lunch or dinner  look no further.  We came for breakfast in a Saturday morning. The lines are loooong and sitting is on benches outside. First  you need to order the food  you give them your cell number and you are called when it s time to pick up the food.  I had the poblanas and fish tacos. The fish was very tasty but a bit too salty. My daughter had tHe original for breakfast and I think it was a bit better than the poblanas. The chips and guacamole is very good too.
Veracruz All Natural,89,Love this place. Great options for vegetarians and vegans  beans can be without lard. Nice breakfast tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,90,Cauliflower taco Furioso is a must-try here   It is so good that you won t miss  tacos with meat  and their fish taco is really great too  There is a juice truck next to the taco truck which is very nice. They have great smoothies and juices as well.  Love the atmosphere here  It can be crowed on weekends though.
Veracruz All Natural,91,Top 3 taco spots in Austin. Great spot in Mueller park  family friendly  and quick lunch break. Grab yourself a taco and have a little picnic in the park. Tacos were flavorful and filling  An array of different options  something for everybody.
Veracruz All Natural,92,When I asked my native Texan friends what food spots to visit  many of them said I had to get some Veracruz tacos. Maybe my expectations were set too high  but I thought this place was decent but nothing amazing. Came on a Tuesday afternoon for a late lunch and there was practically no line.   Ordered the Migas Originales and La Reyna. Both of them were pretty good but I can t say this was one of my favorite spots during my visit to Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,93,Migas breakfast tacos are everything  This place definitely lives up to the hype and is one of my must visits in Austin. They have hot sauces out for you but make sure you get a little taste before putting it on the tacos. I remembered some being quite spicy while others weren t. The seating is outdoors and pretty busy but people seem to not hang out for too long.  I was on a food adventure so after eating breakfast at Veracruz  I walked over to grab BBQ five minutes down.
Veracruz All Natural,94,Amazing breakfast tacos.  It is a food truck but had good amount of parking.  Honesty all the options were good. Good service  good food.  Can t go wrong.
Veracruz All Natural,95,Came here for Texas breakfast tacos. Love the outdoor seating and you can only order online now so they have a QR code you can scan.  Chorizo and Eggs - very decadent and very tasty. The avocado salsa cuts through the fat well  Migas Originales - this was my favorite and I officially love breakfast tacos. Loved the crunch of the tortilla chips in the soft pillowing egg and homemade flour tortilla  Grilled chicken - very standard  very Tex mex  super spicy with the red salsa
Veracruz All Natural,96,Completely walked passed this walking to Radio coffee shop but I got it togo and forgot to take photos as I dug into them. I got their furioso  barbacoa and steak tacos. The barbacoa had the most flavors and very tender. I was delightfully surprised with the Furioso taco  vegetarian taco   Would get this again for sure. The steak tacos were good. Traditional but honestly may try something different next time. Would ask for extra hot sauce if you like things spicy as the containers are pretty small.
Veracruz All Natural,97,While visiting from the Bay Area of Northern California we had to stop at this place after hearing and reading about it.  Glad I did. Not only is it cute is appearance but they were all very friendly too. Their setup isn t like just a taco truck. They have a school but outfitted as their main truck and then side trucks for the butcher  I think  and a separate on also for the juice bar. How cool. They had beepers that told you when your food was ready also which was nice. They had plenty of seating and even a little deck with a tent on it with chairs under it. How cool. With napkin dispensers and sanitizer near by for cleanliness.   Now. For the food.  I got some micas tacos and pastor taco. To drink. Ahuja Fresca strawberry drink. All were great. Micas were awesome. Had a billion tacos in my life but these were unique. Pastor was good too. Had pineapple in it which makes it very tasty. Not the best pastor I ve ever had in my life as in Oakland California where I live  there s still a place that is my favorite all time. But. Pastor was still good. Veracruz has awesome homemade tortillas which were superior tho.   The micas taco was a very unique sort of breakfast taco and it was awesome. Comes with a Alvarado lime salsa  I think. It was soft and green and had those flavors  and a red more spicy and bold hot sauce. That s the one I preferred. That woth some lime squeezed. Wow. Lovely beautiful place with good food. And honestly. Pretty cheap too. Like 3.25 or something for each taco. These days if you find then 2  a price that s great and the atmosphere here and level of taco they made. Worth more than that i would say. They could easily charge 4  a taco and be fine. Anyways. I highly recommend.
Veracruz All Natural,98,A solid four star for my first lunch in Austin this time  9 22 2020 . We ordered three different kinds of tacos for two of us  which were just enough and so we would have enough space for another meal at night. Migas original and finish tacos were two of the three. They use fresh ingredients  cook them properly  serve the right away which push the taco to a formal dish  if you will. Their tacos are not what you d expect from a street food truck  I d love to come back here at my next visit to Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,99,Went here for lunch on a Friday. The tacos were pretty good but a little pricey. The Grilled Steak taco was very good with amazing flavor. The Al Pastor taco was just ok  I prefer more pineapple  there were maybe 1-2 pieces in the one taco . Overall  decent tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,100,Best tacos around if you ask me. The online ordering is pretty sweet on weekdays  and they seem to be doing fun events on weekends. I ve enjoys pretty much everything I ve had  although the smoothies could use a bit more flavor. Still  I can t complain  tacos are legit.
Veracruz All Natural,101,Awful wait. Even worse service. Don t bother for mediocre taco with dry beef and soggy chips...
Veracruz All Natural,102,Been here plenty  food is fine  but has steadily gone downhill in terms of service. Most recent visit resulted in a 50 minute wait for three bacon bean and cheese tacos that we never actually picked up because we were originally quoted a 20 minute wait time and had a spot to be. Tons of signs around this place that read  please be patient  we make fresh food  not fast food  but when there are 10 minute periods where nobody s order is put out on what seemed to be an average Monday lunch  you have to question if they re appropriately organizing themselves in the kitchen. There are plenty of places within 5 minutes of this spot that can be the same level of busy and deliver food on par with this spot  but with 7-10 minutes of waiting at most.
Veracruz All Natural,103,Our group of friends were visiting Austin and heard this place was one of the best for Breakfast Tacos. We went near 11am  so it was the peak of sun hours. Unfortunately Veracruz is a food truck with a few picnic tables and some umbrella overhead covers so we were baking under the sun while in line.   Menus are on the right hand side of the small order window hole  where you tell the cashier what you want and then they will give you a buzzer for your drinks  and will text you when your food is ready for pick up at the window on the far right hand side. The sauces and utensils are also on the far right hand side.  Migas Originales   3.50   Really great flavors going on here  and I love the texture difference with the tortilla chips. The sauce that s used with this taco is delicious     Fish Taco   3.75   When I saw this was Grilled Tilapia  I was hesitant as I m used to battered fish. However  the flavor on this fish was super good. Definitely don t sleep on this. I got this with a corn tortilla as most fish tacos I ve had are on corn tortillas  but I think I would ve wanted it on flour instead.   Berry Strong Smoothie  16oz -  5.00   First taste - all peanut butter. Definitely didn t taste much of any of the other fruits. I tried Pink Panther from my friends and I liked that better. Still refreshing regardless.  Strawberry Agua Fresca  32oz -  4.00   This was absolutely worth the price  I loved the strawberry flavor but some of my friends that got other flavors like watermelon...too many seeds.
Veracruz All Natural,104,Great tacos  hit the spot. Not much more to say - def recommend and the habanero salsa is amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,105,Although it s been a long time since I visited  this place absolutely deserves a 5 star review from me- and that I feel compelled to 2 years later should tell you something  I went here to recover from my birthday party in 2018 and while the tacos were delicious  I m still dreaming about that mango agua fresca.
Veracruz All Natural,106,Tacos are delicious  I got a chorizo  amp  egg taco plus a migas poblanas taco  the migas taco definitely surpassed my expectations. The corn tortilla was OK on each of them  I would probably do flour next time for more texture. My only  complaint  would be the service  the girl who took our order was a bit short and didn t seem very helpful. I ordered a cantaloupe water and was not instructed that I had to pick it up on the trailer beside it. Also noticed some confusion for people picking up online orders but I think they were slammed during that Sunday morning.
Veracruz All Natural,107,I did not think the tacos here were that great. Nothing worth waiting for in the heat.  Ordered a Migas Originales and an Al Pastor taco. I felt like both tacos lacked flavor and nothing stood out.
Veracruz All Natural,108,Okay so since I can t find the right location this is a rating for the truck at Radio coffee and the location at the Line Hotel downtown Okay let me start by saying I always felt the north location  that is now closed  had the best flavor. Why  I don t know. But when I had their vegetarian tacos  no cheese  last year it blew my mind. Wonderful bean  to spice ratio. Wasn t over the top oily and it had plenty of salt  but not high blood pressure kind ... So then I had their green salsa and quac and was sold even more.  Go to now.. I have had both locations and no salt  too much oil and honestly no flavor. I am so sad too because I really wanted to love this place. Now the quac is still good  but their chips are too oily too and hurts my stomach.   I think for many that eat meat this place is great or maybe some people find things they love better than I  I am not saying don t try this place  I am just saying my perspective is that if your eating a taco the oil shouldn t be the thing you taste the most  even with hot sauce on it . The customer service is still great.. unless they are super busy at Radio and you can tell they are like.. don t ask questions.. just order online and go please lol.. The Line Hotel has been a wonderful customer service experience 100  of the time for me. Please remember to wear your mask and order online ahead of time. They both get packed and normally takes about 45 min to fill an order. So save your self some time and just show up when the email says so   .
Veracruz All Natural,109,Ordered tacos  quesadilla and guacamole to go. Everything was packed poorly and sour cream that was advertised on the menu wasn t added.   Also  the fly on the picture speaks for itself. We almost ate it. Fortunately we weren t very eager with the guacamole.
Veracruz All Natural,110,Last year  after spending a month in Mexico  I went to another Veracruz location and had the best tacos I ve ever had. Of course I had to come back--and folks  they ve done it again. Had a potato and cheese  fish and al pastor. All phenomenal. Just out of this world. The balance and explosion of flavors is just to die for. Sauces are simply the best. Plus the outside eating area here is super huge and cute. I also got a yummy Orange juice. If you re in Austin  GO. P
Veracruz All Natural,111,Awesome tacos and drinks  which in itself would make it 4-5 stars. But... They are doing away with online ordering  So now you have to wait in a long line then wait for food after that. People take awhile to review the menu when they get to the front of the line  then order  which is sooo inefficient. Unfortunately  this makes it way too tedious for us. We live in the neighborhood and loved VC being our incredible local taco truck. But having to go back to very long lines is in effect excluding local customers who are busy or have small kids to instead focus on tourists. Ouch
Veracruz All Natural,112,This food truck is a  so cute b  SO TASTY.   We came on a Saturday morning after spending way too long looking at lists of the best breakfast tacos in Austin and these clearly made the list for a reason.   There was a pretty consistent line  but not too long  the whole time we were there  but they were pretty quick and we got our food within  10 minutes. I got 1 La Reyna and 1 Migas Poblanas and they were both GREAT. Their salsas definitely add a little kick too so I d add them.   Seating options are some picnic tables so if it rains it might get a bit wet  they just have light umbrellas   but honestly I d still try to come because these were the best brekky tacos I had during my trip 
Veracruz All Natural,113,MIGAS AND AGUA FRESCAS.  After a kinda disappointing meal at the very hyped la BBQ down the street  we stopped by Veracruz for a 2nd lunch to satisfy our tummies. Boy were we glad that this also very hyped place hit the mark for us  Coming from SoCal  I do call myself a taco expert so that s saying a lot   We arrived around 1pm on a Sunday and waited around 40 minutes until we ordered at the small trailer. The whole time in line  we debated leaving because it didn t seem like these tacos would be that delish. But sooo glad we waited it out   Migas Originales was by far the favorite at our table. Filled with egg  tortilla chips  monterey jack cheese  cilantro  tomato  onion  avocado  this was savory  tangy  and fresh. This pretty hefty taco was filling  I slathered on some of the salsa and was in a perfect foodie heaven.  I also tried the La Reyna and a Bfast taco with Sausage and Potato  but both of those didn t really stand out. Sure they tasted good but were easily overshadowed by the Migas.  We also got the Mango Agua Fresca and were shocked by how delicious it was  It was the perfect refreshing pick-me-up we needed on a warm day of lots of walking. You can literally taste how fresh it is with the mango pulp. It was so good that we came back 2 days to get another one   Tacos here are a bit more than I expected to pay  but for these made-to-order delicious tacos  I m very willing to shell out  4 for these. ILYSM Veracruz 
Veracruz All Natural,114,The breakfast tacos here are delicious. I especially love the migas tacos. I ventured outside of it  la reyna   and was wondering why didn t I just get more migas tacos. I like my taco tortillas double layered a bit more  but this was good still.  I loved how simple it was and the tortilla chips in the migas tacos. Felt light  simple  and focusing on the limited ingredients. It s not super complicated  but it sure as hell is delicious.  The agua Fresca was also great  and huge  . I would recommend getting one for every two people.
Veracruz All Natural,115,All the tacos I had in Austin were good  but Veracruz was super good. Well  I ve tried a few of the tacos but I think the breakfast tacos are the best ones. I prefer the Migas Originales and Migas Poblanas to the La Reyna. Each taco has a perfect mix of flavor and texture  from the tortilla chips . The cold avocado goes perfect on top of the other warm ingredients.   The Agua Frescas are LARGE and great on a hot day. I really enjoyed the watermelon one. I tried mango too and wasn t as good.
Veracruz All Natural,116,Oh come on  Our first time at this  over  hyped place.  You re supposed to get a text you when your foods ready  but after an hour and 10 minutes still no text. We went up to ask and they told us it was made already. Huh   Tacos were fine but no taco is worth over an hours wait. I like taco deli and it took 5 minutes. Over rated.
Veracruz All Natural,117,Not only one of the best things we ate in Austin  the best breakfast taco I ve ever had  Wow  Cannot say enough about how good Veracruz is. If we lived here  I would so come here everyday for breakfast  Migas Poblanos was our go to. Also had a chorizo taco which was spicy and delicious but the Migas was our fav by far  When I think of the Migas Poblanos I think of fresh  fresh  fresh  From the fresh made corn tortillas  to the fresh chips in the eggs  to the fresh avocado and fresh salsa s.  I can t forget their Aguas Frescas  Love  love  love Aquas Frescas  In fact over the course of a few days  and in the best interest of science  I took it upon myself to sample all of their flavors. For the record they were all excellent with my favs being the watermelon and cucumber. They do have other tacos here that unfortunately we didn t get to try because we were too busy eating their breakfast tacos. We would so come back to Austin just to eat these breakfast tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,118,Poblano Migas Taco was amazing and the salsas are great  Go on the weekends for a cool flea market as well.
Veracruz All Natural,119,Looking for some bomb tacos this is the place  Probably the best fish taco I ve ever had  Also tried the vegans cauliflower taco and pastor also were solid tacos. The salsa is packed with flavor. It has outside seating so you can even bring your dog along.
Veracruz All Natural,120,A taco truck in a parking lot shared by Kerlin s and pretty much nothing else  I arrived to find a line on a late Friday afternoon. Good signs  usually. Waited in the furnace of heat from the Austin sun to put my order in for three tacos and a mango juice.   I got my Al pastor  fajita chicken  and fish tacos after a reasonable wait considering the crowd. Overall very interesting flavor descriptions but the execution just fell flat. The expectation is built up with the list of ingredients  but the flavor combination just feels like it s missing something that would pull it together better. Side note  the meat could ve been drained a little better to parent a soggy taco.  Juice was refreshing.
Veracruz All Natural,121,When I got there I wasn t wearing a mask because it was outside  but instead of kindly asking me to put on a mask  the lady abruptly said  We can t serve you without wearing a mask  order online.  As I turned to put my mask on she already left the window and I had to wait for someone else to take my order. I entered my phone number for them to contact me when my food was ready  but I noticed everyone that was after me in line getting their food  so I go up and ask for my order. It was ready several minutes ago  but they never texted me. I double checked the number on the receipt and it was right  so I was bummed I didn t get the text  As a result  my tacos were not hot and fresh  so I didn t get the hype of this place. Bummer.   
Veracruz All Natural,122,Enjoyed and would come back again  Love the food and scenery here   Definitely recommend to friends and family 
Veracruz All Natural,123,First breakfast tacos I had since I moved from San Antonio. I ve always heard SA tacos were better but damn ... they got nothing on Veracruz tacos. Amazing flavor and portions  will not disappoint
Veracruz All Natural,124,For many years this was one of my favorite taco places. I have been to most of their locations  but my favorite used to be the location adjacent to Radio Coffee. The food is good  but it s a nightmare to get your order and then if it s incorrect you have to wait in a long line behind others putting in their order and then wait another 40 minutes to get the corrected item s . That means others in your party are long done eating. It s just not an enjoyable experience anymore at Vera Cruz. They used to be efficient  had friendly face to face interactions with their customers  but now they keep an iPad on the counter so you walk up and self order. Due to this change  I just order before leaving my home which is twenty minutes away and still the wait upon arrival was another thirty minutes  then on my last visit was when my order was wrong. The one visible employee tucked back to the side behind the counter  the same one who had just given me the corrected taco became too busy prepping to go orders and refused to pause for a second to give me napkins. He literally told me he was too busy and I would just have to wait. So after five minutes waiting in front of him  I gave up. Vera Cruz has absolutely lost ALL touch with their clientele.
Veracruz All Natural,125,There is nothing like living outside of Texas to make a girl miss a good breakfast taco. And Veracruz definitely satisfied that craving--so much yum  I first tried a Veracruz breakfast taco  bacon egg cheese avocado  when I was staying at the LINE hotel downtown. I loved it so much that I had  multiple of  the same thing for lunch at the Mueller farmer s market literally the next day. Now that I m back in Texas and living in the Mueller area  I know that I ll be a regular 
Veracruz All Natural,126,Cool location they have their own food truck courtyard with lots of tables.  Their migas tacos are the best don t bother getting anything else. We got the traditional but the beans and potatoes weren t very well seasoned.  The chips are made with their had made corn tortillas but a little thick when made into chips but guacamole was awesome. Great food and atmosphere but migas tacos are the winner here.
Veracruz All Natural,127,I am almost positive Veracruz uses A LOT of MSG in their egg seasoning. I ve got a keen tongue for that  and knowing the Mexican meat markets I frequent in Kansas City that showed me how they make arranchera  the MSG in their meat matches the sodium profile exactly to the migas I had at Veracruz. If you don t mind premature cell degradation  then their migas are wildly flavorful  clean  and well made wonderful tacos.   The chips in the Migas especially were such a welcomed  novel addition. With such flavor and texture  I really liked their migas - but I don t think I d ever return  at  4.10 each  they re absolutely NOT a good value - quite the contrary to what a taco is  especially when coming out of a broke-down school bus in a gravel parking lot. I don t care how many umbrellas you put up - your tacos are not worth almost  5 a piece - even with all that Avocado. And with no meat  Nope.  One of Food Network s best tacos in America  Well  I ll stop considering the Food Network an authority after that.
Veracruz All Natural,128,The migas originales is absolutely delicious with freshly fried crispy tortilla chips in it. The chips are home made and the green and habanero salsa are delicious.  They forgot my order even though I was the only customer there and they kept mispronouncing my name  first time being called  Jova   so minus 1 star.
Veracruz All Natural,129,Came here on they recommendation of a friend who ate here last time in Austin. We came here after a hike so rest assured  my friends and I were really hungry here. We came around 1pm and there was quite a line to order   I wasn t bothered really because that just means it must be worth it  . You go up to the window  order  amp  pay  then get a number and wait around until your order is ready at the next window.   Steak fajitas taco - simple  good and tasty  Fish taco - I m a sucker for a fish taco  fish was fresh and tasty and the slaw it came with added a nice crunch  Al pastor taco - the best of the bunch  kinda greasy but oh so much flavor  I also recommend getting both types of hot sauces they offer  they really add a nice heat to the tacos ...  TLDR  very very good authentic tacos in Austin and I would 100  come back
Veracruz All Natural,130,We went on a mission to the Veracruz food truck after a friend recommended this spot  and my only regret is that I didn t get two migas tacos. I thought I would just customize my other taco. No  just get the migas taco. Or two. Or three. And get some chips and guac to snack on while you wait for your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,131,I walked miles to get here  We came for the breakfast tacos and I fell in love with the regular lunchtime tacos.  It s a short and simple menu with a couple of different breakfast taco options and a few lunch taco options.    I was with a large group and each person s food came out pretty quickly. Everyone else was equally as pleased with their tacos  breakfast and regular. If you re in the area I highly recommend this place.  Try a breakfast taco but think you ll be very happy with the lunch dinner tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,132,DELICIOUS  I m not kidding when I say this is hands down the best tasting breakfast tacos I ve EVER had in my life  I ve tried the el sancho  El tradicion  and migas problamos  If you ve never been or curious to try it out  this is your sign to check it out  You won t regret it Migas PoblanasChorizo and Eggs
Veracruz All Natural,133,My favorite breakfast taco place  Their migas has good seasoning  a nice crunch from the tortilla chips  juicy  and fresh. I kept thinking about it and wishing I had gotten more than just one migas  also wishing that we didn t only just go once during our trip  cry  
Veracruz All Natural,134,Best migas tacos in Austin and some of the best tacos period. Enough said   Just watch out for the line. It s outrageous. If there s more than 10 people in line  just forget about it and leave. Once you get to the counter  it ll be another 40 min to get your food.   Pro tip  they open super late so come for dinner instead. Don t bother on a nice weekend morning brunch lunch
Veracruz All Natural,135,This is an absolute delight. Fresh ingredients and freshly prepared  great out door seating. Great way to start the day with a breakfast taco   
Veracruz All Natural,136,If I could only choose to eat one dish in Austin  it would be the migas originales taco from Veracruz. I don t care if it s 100 degrees outside  I will sweat it out for migas. Their green and orange sauces are also fuego  literally  hot and delicious.  I usually like to start the table off with some chips and guac. You can ignore the salsa since you can just get some salsa from the table. Then I ll usually get 1 or 2 migas originales tacos and another meat taco - I prefer the al pastor over the chicken mole  but I might just start only getting migas from now on. I have also tried la reyna  but that one tastes a tad too  healthy  for me. I m a corn tortilla gal  so I love their house made tortillas  Their quesadilla was also delish.  Make sure to order your agua fresca early too or else you might have to wait long. Sometimes it doesn t come until all of your food is out since it has a  separate line.  Orange and watermelon flavors have been good. Mango was not good last time - I think because they were pretty much out of fruit at the time.  If it s hot outside  you might wanna bring an umbrella to block the sun. The line can be brutal but it s worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,137,Overall  amazing meal. My only complaint is their hours. We had to drive 30 minutes there and back to get the food because this was the only location that was open. The food was mostly warm by the time we got back  but it wasn t super convenient since there s one closer to us and it took us so long the worker was calling asking where we were.  The chips are super thick and filling. The Al Pastor quesadillas are what have me on an Al Pastor kick right now because they re amazing. Flavorful  tender  and delicious.   I also reached out to who ate with me to ask their opinion and here s the review  Vera Cruz - I would literally die to keep this place in business. The best tacos I ve had in Texas  hands down. The al pastor was marinated perfectly. It reminded me of tacos I used to have from my friend who caters Mexican food for a living.  And then  because we were talking about it  he ordered it again. That speaks for itself 
Veracruz All Natural,138,Wow  this was my favorite meal in Austin. This was a permanent food truck location with picnic tables for seating  and our group was lucky enough to snag an unoccupied table. I took pictures of the menu to share with the group chat  so people securing our seating area could order while the other half of the group waited in the long line.    I shared chips  amp  guacamole with the group  and we all loved the guacamole. It was seasoned to perfection with fresh ingredients. The chips were crunchy but didn t hurt. The salsa was readily available to add to tacos in a little sauce bar. It had small bits of avocado in there too  The hot sauce was amazing and also located at the sauce bar along with utensils  napkins  and small containers for whatever sauces to bring back to the table to-go.   Even though it was breakfast  I ordered an al pastor taco  pork marinated with pineapple and spices  cilantro  onion  grilled pineapple  and fajita steak taco  with cilantro  onion  queso fresco  and avocado . Those tacos were deleted fairly quickly despite coming out fresh  hot  and steamy  I still think about the tacos and the hot sauce  and I wish we had food items like this more available in my area.
Veracruz All Natural,139,First time here  and last. I can not do bad customer service.  Came in to place a border  which clearly was an inconvenience to staff from the stern looks and eye rolls I received. I asked a question about if the full menus is available or breakfast only which lead to more annoyed looks and eye rolls and snappy responses. I proceed to place a order which included a smoothie. Another representative who was a little less irked responded   ma am we aren t doing smoothies.  This was not one of the items on the menu board marked  not available . If I were not short or time I would have moved on but it definitely will not recommend or revisit.
Veracruz All Natural,140,Ate here while on a trip to the area a while back. I keep thinking about how good the breakfast tacos and agua fresca were. I want more   Popular place. When we got there the line was only about 15 people but by the time we left it was closer to 40 or more. Worth the wait  though.
Veracruz All Natural,141,Came here for lunch a few Sundays ago when the bf and I were in town. It was fairly busy when we got there  but the turnaround is relatively quick  and we were able to secure seating by the time we had ordered and gotten our food. I opted for one of their migas poblanas and of their la reyna tacos. The bf got one of their fajita chicken and one of their al pastor tacos. There was a bit of a wait  but there is a pager system where you ll get a text message when your food is ready  and things are churned out quickly enough. As for the tacos  we both thought they were quite good  and I would say that the tacos I had here were arguably the best breakfast tacos I had during my trip. The hot sauces salsas they had on the side were great  also. Would definitely come back here or to one of their other locations if I happened to be in Austin again.
Veracruz All Natural,142,I used to really love their tacos but I think several places in Austin make better ones.  2 tacos with chips  salsa and guac will run you  30.   That s more than you will pay at most brick and mortar taco shops.
Veracruz All Natural,143,While visiting Austin from New York  my fianc  and I made an agreement to avoid eating at the same place more than once - we wanted to try as much as we could during our weekend trip.   After trying Veracruz for breakfast  we knew we would be back the next day...   We stopped by on a Sunday and Monday morning. While Sunday was a bit more crowded   9am   we didn t wait too long for the food. While we waited  we shared a Do a smoothie  a blend of orange juice and mango. It was really delicious  sweet  tangy  and refreshing. We ordered it both times.   The most impressive menu item is probably the Migas breakfast tacos. A corn tortilla is a must - each one is handmade and stuffed with scrambled eggs  tortilla crisps  onions  avocado  and more. I personally enjoyed the Migas Poblanos more. It has roasted poblano peppers and black beans in addition to all that other good stuff in the Migas.   They usually have the full menu available at any time of day. We tried the steak  chicken  and fish tacos all at 9am  so much to eat  so little time   and everything was excellent.   The service is on the slower side  but while waiting  you can load up on sauces and salsas from the cooler nearby. I loved their green sauce and spicy salsa. Thanks Veracruz for the great Austin experience 
Veracruz All Natural,144,Best tacos in round rock  Love their agua frescas    I went there when I worked closed by  but still go there after the pandemic 
Veracruz All Natural,145,My favorite Tacos of Texas. I ve been many times in the rain - it s that good. This specific branch is the taco truck site. I recommend the Migas tacos  fish tacos  or... just any taco.   There s some picnic tables in their closed in area and they re adjacent to a lot. It s a bit gravelly but you won t have trouble finding a spot to either pick up or eat there.
Veracruz All Natural,146,We ordered the Al Pastor and the Fajita Steak. Both were yummy  but the Fajita Steak was my favorite    There was a line when we arrived but it was pretty quick. It was raining but they do have umbrellas over their tables which helped.   Overall  great place to stop on our road trip 
Veracruz All Natural,147,Came here hung over in the morning not hungry but i was soo glad i did. It doesnt really look like much just a trailer with some tables but the wow the food is amazing. Also a good sign that there was a line when we rolled up around noon on the sunday. Got the migas taco  steak  and bacon and egg. My favorites were the migas and steak. The steak is so juicy soft and flavor ful and the migas taco as someone from SF is nothing like ive had before but sooo good. A must with all the tacos are the salsas  try them all cause they all have something great about them. During my visit ate plenty of breakfast tacos and this place is one of the best that i will definitely come back to 
Veracruz All Natural,148,So  so good. I truly wish we had a place like this back home. Everything we had here was exceptional  we got a whole variety of tacos  as well as some of the agua fresca. Definitely a wait to get your food and drinks  but it s worth it. A pleasant outdoor environment  too 
Veracruz All Natural,149,Amazing food  peculiar location and set up... the chicken tacos are AMAZING.  I also ordered the la bomba juice which took time to make  now I understand. It was refreshing. My table of 7 all ordered a variety and had zero complaints. We found this place via buzzfeed. I m so happy and full.
Veracruz All Natural,150,Veracruz was recommended by many of our friends so had to give it a try. We first tried to go to Franklin s bbq but the line was outrageous so we went to Veracruz. This was around 1 30 so figured the line wouldn t be too bad.. wrong. We were about 10th in line and a lot had sold out by that point. We ended up getting a Migas poblano  chicken mole and al pastor. The highlight for me were the salsas. They were absolutely divine. The hot salsa had a kick but soo flavorful and packed with heat. The corn tortillas on the tacos were delicious and filling as each had two tortillas per taco. I would definitely go again but if there was a lot sold out  It wouldn t be worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,151,This was also on our must-eat list in Austin and was kinda disappointed.  When we came  there was probably 7-8 people ahead of us but we still waited about 40-50 minutes.  It looks like they make everything fresh to order  which is nice  but for a food truck  they may need more employees as there were people who left because the wait was too long.  We got the breakfast tacos with eggs  potatoes and sausage  a steak fajita taco  chips and guacamole and salsa and a watermelon fresca. -Breakfast tacos with corn tortilla  very filling  eat bite  things would fall out.  The tortilla was very weak and flimsy  probably need 2.  Flavor though  was very good. -Steak fajita taco with flour tortilla  the flour tortilla was way better.  The steak was ok  a little chewy but flavor was also there.  Not as filling as the breakfast tacos but still pretty filling. -chips with guacamole salsa  chips was very good  you can tell it is freshly made.  The guacamole and salsa was standard. -watermelon fresca - probably one of my favorite thing on the menu.  Very big  two people can probably share one.  It is fresh and refreshing for a hot day.  Price wise  I thought it was pretty reasonable except for the chips and guacamole salsa.  For chips and guacamole  it was  5  and to add the salsa  it s an extra  2.  However  you can order chips and salsa for just  3  and they even have salsa at the condiment table that you can grab for free...so I wasn t sure why they did that.  Otherwise  I thought everything was good  just nothing spectacular. The wait is usually 20-30 minutes after you order before you get your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,152,We had to wait in line for about 30min and the line kept getting longer after us. We had the fish taco a chicken torta and the migas originales. The fish taco with corn tortilla fell apart  but the fish was actually really good. The chicken torta was ok my bf rlly liked it. The migas was just not memorable for me. It was just like another breakfast taco so i don t get the hype over that. Everything was just average and i wouldn t come back to try anything else
Veracruz All Natural,153,Best breakfast tacos in Austin  Migas are a must. I personally like the migas poblana best but most people prefer the original.
Veracruz All Natural,154,I moved into this neighborhood so I couldn t wait to make Veracruz my regular taco spot. But every time I tried to go  there was a line to even order- which means like an hour wait.  I finally went on. Monday at about noon when there were only 3 people in front of me in line. My order still took about 35 minutes to come out. They make their food fresh and seem pretty efficient with a dedicated person taking orders  another one calling names and expediting.  The food itself is still great  Got my usual migas and fish tacos but also tried the La Reyna breakfast taco and they were all delicious as before.  I m not always in the mood to wait 40  minutes but when I am  I ll be back 
Veracruz All Natural,155,BOMB ASS TACOS.  2 tacos  with a lot of different flavors. This food truck gets a lot of foot traffic from nearby construction workers so sometimes there will be line. Cheap  delicious tacos. You can t beat that 
Veracruz All Natural,156,We were visiting Austin for the first time and craving breakfast tacos. This place was suggested to us and I m so glad we went. I myself had the two different Migas tacos and chicken mole taco. The Migas tacos were super tasty. Lives up to the hype. Chicken mole was pretty good as well. Each taco is decent sized and about 2 - 3 would fill me up. This place was packed when we went NYE morning and finding a table can be hard.
Veracruz All Natural,157,Got delicious breakfast tacos. You have to order online  no walk ups. I also got the el pastor taco which isn t technically a breakfast one but it was delicious. Great little seating area outdoors too.
Veracruz All Natural,158,The breakfast taco  the steak  and the shrimp taco were amongst the best I ve ever had  They all had robust flavors and tasted as they were composed of fresh ingredients.  Next time I m in Austin I will definitely give this spot another visit - 5 stars   
Veracruz All Natural,159,I came in with high hopes but was disappointed in a couple ways. For starters  this seems to be consistently packed and since it s outdoors the seating is limited. I will say though their service seems quick but they don t tend to the condiment table often enough. They also didn t have their drinks  limes  or the salsa they serve with their chips  which they don t give refills for cause they re homemade . For  3 the fajita steak taco was good  coulda went without the one slice of avocado they throw on there  but the Al pastor was what threw me off. The consistency was mushy  amp  although I firmly believe pineapple elevates an Al pastor taco  I think that s what made the meat too soft  amp  wet  I couldn t finish it cause it was so off putting .   As a Mexican Houstonian  I was hoping for more but I guess this wasn t the spot to expect above average from. I really wanted to enjoy the experience cause they felt authentic  but looking at their dominant customer base  I m not surprised their food seemed to be dull in flavor and spice. I also wasn t too wild for the salsa - which can sometimes be a teller as to how much a chef cares for their food cause a good salsa can really elevate a taco.   All in all  I wish it coulda gone better but I m grateful it was easy to find and a decent hot meal at the moment.
Veracruz All Natural,160,Tasty tacos  quite unique flavor also.  First of all the homemade corn tortillas were great IMO  they re a bit moister than I m used to but slightly thicker.  If you re looking for a  neater  taco that you can hold then i d rec the flour tortilla  but my money is on the corn.  Tacos tried   Migas - 5 stars Migas Poblanas - 4 stars Fajita beef taco - 5 stars Fish taco - 4 stars chorizo egg taco - 4 stars  All the tacos we tried were great and the salsas they create compliment them very well.  The orange sauce was pretty hot  my favorite.  We also had chips and guac along with their salsa  can t go wrong.  Only bummer was the line  but thats just a sign of a good establishment.  The people that work here were all very nice.  Would I wait an hour again  hmm maybe not  but I d wait 20 mins for sure.
Veracruz All Natural,161,If you re going to get THE breakfast taco of all time then you have to stop by here.  I was recommended to go here by a couple of locals and even though I had to stand in line under the blazing hot sun for what felt like hours   realistically it was like 50 min  sweating enough to fill a kiddie pool  I still can say it was worth it.   1. You have to get the Migas Taco 2. You have to get the Agua Fresca  Watermelon or Mango   The Migas Taco here were incomparable to other migas tacos I had around the area. They just do it better here. If I could go back  I would have ordered 5 of these. Instead I got one of their fish tacos and though it was delicious  still preferred their migas taco. Nothing was soggy  everything was full of flavor  and their corn tortilla was perfect   As for their Agua frescas  you ll want a large one all to yourself to combat the heat. I m not from Texas  so heat is not a concept I m familiar with  I don t deal with heat too well  and their agua fresca was the only thing keeping my body sane.   Seating is all open patio seating and most of the tables are covered with umbrellas but definitely lay on the sunscreen during the day. There isn t too much seating available but the because there s usually a wait  the tables rotate out pretty quick.   If I m dreaming of Austin  I m dreaming of this place and their tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,162,Migos is what it s all about. Apparently  breakfast tacos are the IN-thing in Austin. Awesome because I love a simple egg  avocado  cheese wrapped up for a big bite.  Food trucks are also a thing in L.A. but not like Austin. I really like how you ll randomly find a parking lot shared with a few food trucks. I think that s part of what makes Austin so great to visit. In a white converted school bus is Veracruz. And in it are hard working ladies. Order at one window and pick up at the other. Picnic benches for seating.  When I saw that watermelon juice was an option  I had to have it  and in a large  please  So refreshing and delicious  not too sweet for a warm day. The migos taco was perfect  I really wanted to get another one  but we had other spots to eat at. I d love to come back here when we plan another Austin trip in the future.
Veracruz All Natural,163,Veracruz All Natural has solid migas and a great atmosphere.   This Veracruz is tucked in a nook next to a bbq joint. The parking lot was pretty full when we visited so we had to go on a side street.   There s some seating and we didn t have too much of a problem finding a seat  although we did share a table with another party.   The aquas frescas was really refreshing  We had the migas too which were very good and the steak quesadilla was another great pick.   Veracruz has a cozy  clean atmosphere and good food 
Veracruz All Natural,164,One of the strangest things I discovered about food trucks in Texas don t actually move around to different locations. Unlike those in Los Angeles  food trucks in Austin stay parked in the same location- strange  but convenient.   Before coming to Austin  I heard good things about the Tex-Mex food here and especially great things about Veracruz. My friends and I headed here for lunch on a Monday and luckily didn t run into a huge line. Veracruz offers a variety of tacos  quesadillas  and drinks- making it enjoyably difficult to decide on what to eat.   After having an internal argument between my brain and stomach  I decided to limit myself to ordering 3 tacos  migas breakfast taco  al pastor taco   amp  fish taco. I also ordered a watermelon  sandia  agua fresca.   Of the tacos I had  I would highly recommend the migas and fish  but pass on the al pastor. The al pastor was too fatty and oily for me. The migas taco was flavorful and I loved how the tortilla chips were still crispy. The fish taco had a generous amount of grilled fish and was refreshing to eat. The watermelon agua fresca was the perfect drink to wash it all down.
Veracruz All Natural,165,Okay I know everyone raves about their tacos--don t get me wrong  they re freakin  bombdotcom BUT honestly let s talk about the salsa. You can order a portion with chips OR scoop some in side containers  although they re tiny af which I don t blame them for . Their salsa and sauces  along with everything else on their menu from corn chips to tortillas are homemade. Not only is their salsa so yum but it s got fresh a v o c a d o chunks in it. I m hyping it  it s worth it though just try it you ll get it. If you re a spicy fanatic like me you ll love their homemade hot sauce  and if you re lame and plane jane mild you ve gotta try the green sauce  jk you re so not lame--do you boo boo     All the above on top of the tacos  along with the homemade authentic everything this literally trailer has to offer just makes it one of a kind  We went twice in one weekend--migas and steak fajita is the way to go
Veracruz All Natural,166,Amazing -- our favorite breakfast taco spot in our week in Austin. First visit  we got two migas tacos  two al pastor  and one migas poblana  plus chips and guac  a berry good smoothie  and a mango tango. The migas tacos were basically perfect  some of my favorites I can remember eating anywhere. The chips and guac were very good. We also liked both smoothies  with a slight preference for the berry good  but I wouldn t say either are musts next time around.  We loved the migas so much we ended up coming back at the end of our trip and getting four of them  plus chips and guac .  Needless to say  the migas are amazing  and I ll be thinking about these until next time we re in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,167,These tacos were awesome. We tried a few places in Austin while we were in town and these were easily the best. From the quality of the meat to the sauces  we couldn t have asked for a better taco. At  4-5 per taco  these are well worth the price.
Veracruz All Natural,168,best tacos of my life go here asap   new favorite taco restaurant i ve ever been to  
Veracruz All Natural,169,Great food and vibe. The fresca is extreme refreshing and the tacos are value for money
Veracruz All Natural,170,Great taco place in Austin  the fish tacos are the best I ve had so far during my time here. The Al Pastor is also great  Veracruz has their own take on it and adds pineapples in it. You might not think this would be good  but it s definitely something you won t know unless you try it. Definitely worth the price and the tacos are slightly bigger than tacos I ve had from other places  like tacodeli and taco shack.
Veracruz All Natural,171,The best tacos I ve had in Austin so far. Loved the shrimp and egg tacos  still reeling  in a good way  from the spice of that salsa  and can t wait to go back 
Veracruz All Natural,172,First stop in Austin was a huge success  minus the line  Although  it was a Saturday afternoon... around 11 30am  so okay you pass.  Taco Trucks are a must in Austin  so of course we decided to try this out  Especially  breakfast tacos... hangover food  much  Outdoor seating w  umbrellas and covered seating. It was slightly drizzling  so don t expect dry seating. The line to order was long  maybe an hour   but receiving the food was a short wait  Takes CC  amp  good luck with parking. We walked.  Tacos  MIGAS  V  - YES. My friends loved it   La Reyna  V  - YES. Healthier option than the migas  amp  Same price. Egg whites  carrots  spinach  avocado  mushroom  bell pepper  pico de gallo  monterey jack cheese  Fish - YES. The Chipotle Mayo Salsa is different  amp  I wanted to put it on everything. Al Pastor - Decent. MEH. Pass.  I think we also got the steak taco  but not sure. Green sauce is just straight spicy  but would recommend the red salsa   Drinks  Agua fresca - Mango or Strawberry were not too sweet and definitely fresh  Must get   Orange apple carrot juice or something and my friend said it was great 
Veracruz All Natural,173,Whats to say that hasn t been said  Best tacos in Austin      Love the Al Pastor.  Their salsas are so good too. Drool.
Veracruz All Natural,174,Truly fantastic tacos from the tortillas to the fresh ingredients and the flavor combo. The add-your-own sauces on the side are solid  too.   I really enjoyed my migas poblanas  egg  tortilla chips  poblano peppers  red onion  queso fresco  black beans  avocado  on flour tortilla  and chicken mole on corn tortilla  though I think the migas were the standout. The mole sauce is really well down though.   The strawberry aguafresca was spot on. So refreshing  perfectly sweetened with cane sugar so not too sweet  and ginormous.   The line moves fairly quickly and they ll tell you the wait time when you order.  On Saturday at 9 45  the wait was about 15 min to order  and another 20 min for the tacos.   This is the OG location though I ve been told all locations are consistently excellent.
Veracruz All Natural,175,Great food but get it to go unless you like fighting with birds for a taco. I got a make your own breakfast taco with chorizo  eggs  and Monterey jack cheese  and a chicken taco. My total for the two was  6.50. The tacos took about 10-15 minutes to make but this was on a weekday around 1 30 pm.
Veracruz All Natural,176,Delicious vegan tacos are featured alongside their traditional taco offerings.  Cheers to their creativity for making healthy Mexican food taste great. Salsas are amazing too 
Veracruz All Natural,177,I am so sad that I only came here once during my trip and only had one taco.   FoodRegrets - I can t stop thinking about that amazing breakfast taco.  So delicious that I want to come back to Austin to have a few more of their migas originales.
Veracruz All Natural,178,THE BEST. The poblano migas is divine  so is their melon smoothie. The food can be a bit of a wait  but is always  always  worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,179,On a very cold and blustery day  I headed to Veracruz  hoping to get some yummy breakfast tacos. To my surprise  there was no line  I ordered a breakfast taco with bacon  potato and avocado  as well as an al pastor and fajita steak taco. To drink  I ordered a Mexico lindo smoothie.  First  the smoothie - DELICIOUS. I loved the subtle lime flavour. I wish I had grabbed the larger size. 5 5.  Now  the tacos. I started with the Al Pastor. Preeeeettttyyyy good. The pork was juicy  the pineapple added some sweetness. 4 5.  The fajita steak was okay  I wasn t a huge fan of the steak. Didn t really have a ton of flavour. 3 5  The breakfast taco I ordered was a custom creation. I don t eat eggs or cheese  so the Migas was out of the question. When I was eating my taco  I realized that there was beans added to it  which I didn t ask for. It was still good  just wasn t in the mood for beans first thing in the am. 3.5 5.  For the price  you can t beat Veracruz. You can get a filling meal of a few tacos for 10-15 . Seriously don t sleep on the smoothies either.
Veracruz All Natural,180,Got the Migas which is their staple and it was delicious  this should be your go to if it s your first visit. Also has their al pastor taco which was unfortunately a little dry but still decent. On the whole though  my favorite was the mole. It can be hard to get right and pretty poor if not done well but it was fantastic and if I went back it would be my first choice. Also had a mango agua fresaca  32oz for  4  which was delicious  just right to offset the earthy flavors of the tacos.   Weather was too cold and windy to sit outside and enjoy the food but they do have a nice small area with picnic tables and umbrellas to enjoy in nice weather. My only complaint would be the lack of hot sauce available to grab and add to your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,181,These tacos are worth waiting in 100  weather for. There are breakfast tacos  veggie options  and authentic al pastor and carne asada to die for. I would ve loved fish tacos  but I didn t love that tilapia was the fish used so I passed. There is a huge variety of agua Fresca to choose from too. The cantaloupe was my choice because it s hard to find  but the pineapple was so refreshing in the heat. In three days  I ate here twice.
Veracruz All Natural,182,This place is elite. E-LITE. I visited the food truck version but I m sure the food is amazing at every location. I got tacos de pastor  veggie  and one of the breakfast taco options with chorizo. I also got a watermelon Agua.  Man...everything was phenomenal. Seriously amazing. I think the pricing is a bit high for your average tacos...but these aint your average tacos. 100  worth a trip.
Veracruz All Natural,183,Best tacos in Austin. Lots of vegan   veg options.  Make sure to order ahead online so you don t have to wait 
Veracruz All Natural,184,Always great food and great service. Parking is accessible and seating indoors and outside as well
Veracruz All Natural,185,Veracruz All Natural is a food truck known for its Street Tacos  but my friend and I visited for the freshly made drinks.  Veracruz offers lots of other different bites like quesadillas and tortas  which I definitely need to try the next time I m in Austin.  Because of its popularity  the wait times can get pretty long.  It took us about 15 min to order and receive our drinks  so I assume the wait for food takes even longer.  We picked up a banana-berry smoothie  pineapple aguas frescas  and a small black coffee.  The fruits in the drinks are so fresh and bright  you can tell that everything is freshly made with real fruit and ingredients.  You get a huge 16 oz drink for under  5  and the larger drink for cents more.  For a refreshing drink to take with you while you walk through the streets of Austin  stop by Veracruz All Natural for a fresh pick-me-up.
Veracruz All Natural,186,Prepare for a line any time on the weekend  and limited to no parking but what great Austin food has either  Haha but so worth it. Al pastor had pineapples onions and cilantro  was some of the freshest tasting ingredients you can expect from a food truck bus. Migas were crispy and also really fresh. Might be taking over taco joint as my favorite bfast taco in town. Gotta make it out here on a weekday next. Please go 
Veracruz All Natural,187,My wife and I really dig this place.  Our first time here ordering  we just got a smoothie  migas taco and a breakfast taco.  We promptly received the taco  took a few bites and I immediately got up and lined up to order some of their other tacos.  It was really good     I ended up ordering another migas  a carne taco  a veggie taco and a chicken taco.  Everything was really good especially the smoothie    We came right as it opened so there was ample spots to sit.  There are plenty of street parking.  The tacos are  3- 4 dollars each and smoothie was about  8 dollars.  I didn t pay too much attention to the price because we wanted to try most of their offerings.  Would recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,188,Veracruz is my kind of food - cheap and tasty. We really just wanted to try some local Austin tacos that weren t Torchy s  and Veracruz was perfect. As a plus  we got to soak up more of that Austin food truck vibe.  We did our Yelp research and got the Fish taco and Migas taco since they were both highly rated  The Migas taco is probably the BEST taco I ve ever had. It s rated in the top 5 tacos in the US by Food Network  and it rEally lives up to that. In addition to the typical egg  avocado  pico de gallo  and cheese  there were even tortilla chips for that extra crunch and flavor. This was so good I ordered a second one  The Fish taco was also great  but the Migas was definitely my favorite. Don t forget to try their salsa as well   Lines weren t long at all for me  but we came at around 1pm on a Friday. It s also a bit out of the way  but it was so worth it. Definitely builded on my already strong impression of Austin foods 
Veracruz All Natural,189,YUM. The fish tacos we re so fresh and had a huge slice of avocado on them. Chips were homemade and super crunchy. So good with the guac. Didn t get a picture of the agua frescas but the pineapple one was like a liquid dole whip. AH-MA-ZING. The wait was pretty long  but it was worth it. I suggest ordering online before you even get to the truck because we waited a long time. The salsas were way too for my liking. A little pico for added flavor would have been nice because I feel like the fish needed a little more salt. Personal opinion. Other than that  thoroughly enjoyed  My friend said she had the best breakfast taco she had ever had. That s a bold statement 
Veracruz All Natural,190,This is a solid breakfast taco place. I didn t know what migas were and had to google it. Apparently  it is tortillas fried with veggies  cheese  and eggs and I read that it is a HUGE deal in Austin. This place boasts of its migas tacos and you will see that everyone is pretty much ordering it  so you kind of HAVE to order it. When I got it  I thought to myself that it looks like chilaquiles  I love chilaquiles. I read that the difference is that chilaquiles is cooked with salsa and migas are cooked with eggs. However  for me to look at that migas taco with salsa and eggs inside  my untrained eye could not differentiate.   The tortilla tasted homemade and I think I could eat that tortilla just for fun without anything. The migas taco was good and I topped it with some salsa at their salsa bar  which made it more delicious. The al pastor taco is different from how I typically experience al pastor in Los Angeles and that is  rotating on a spit slowly while glistening in its juices. Nonetheless  the al pastor taco had very tender  flavorful chunks of pork. One thing I cannot argue is that Austin knows how to do pork right 
Veracruz All Natural,191,Had to do Breakfast Tacos in Austin.  I was told it was a must.  So we waited in a line in the rain  yes - in the rain.  Then we ate our meal on one of their picnic tables under an umbrella that was dripping all around us.  It was wet  chilly and uncomfortable.  Was it worth it   A resounding YES   Loved their breakfast tacos.  We tried their Migas original and two of our own concoctions.  They were all fantastic.  Loved their salsas.  Their tortillas  which can make or break a meal  were the bomb.  Both the flour and corn tortillas were done to perfection.  It was a great meal   We were so hungry that my photos are half eaten  haha 
Veracruz All Natural,192,Long time Austinite  and I can safely say these are the best breakfast tacos out here. Maybe a little overseasoned at times  but overall  incredible. My mother s side is from mexico and the migas tacos remind me of breakfast as a kid. Besides that  the Fish Tacos are some of the best Ive had. I cant speak for anything else on the menu  because im completely addicted to what I ve had.   P.S. Your to-go salsa cups  especially the green  are half-filled at best  I need that green sauce and lots of it  please  Maybe sell portions on the side 
Veracruz All Natural,193,Grilled Chicken taco 5 5 Steak taco 4 5 Chips with guac 3 5  A little pricey at  4 taco but that s Austin for you. The house made corn tortilla was excellent with the chicken taco. The chips were good but the guac was lacking a little flavor  although both were of good quality. The sauces were fine not too spicy.   Will try the breakfast taco Migas next time I think that s the famous item here.  UPDATE  Tried the breakfast tacos the next day. I had the Migas original  Migas poblanos  and El Sancho. 4 5 for all of them. My favorite was the poblanos bc the beans gave it a nice texture.
Veracruz All Natural,194,Apparently their tacos are great... but I m here to talk about their monster quesadilla. I went here with my mom and I m not even kidding or exaggerating when I say that she did a prayer to universe afterwards thanking it for giving her the chance to have such a cheesy quesadilla. 10 10 coming here for their famous tacos later.
Veracruz All Natural,195,As far as breakfast tacos go  their Migas is pretty darn good. It s fairly priced and surprisingly filling. It s simple  but you can tell the ingredients are fresh and freshly prepared. Hopefully next time I m in Austin I can try their Al Pastor.
Veracruz All Natural,196,Honestly the best breakfast taco i ve ever had  ever. None of that dry rubbery eggs   bacon on a limp cold tortilla. This Migas taco was the best ever...so flavorful and filling and warm. I could eat this every morning.   I also had the chicken torta  fish taco  and al pastor. My favorite was the fish taco--it was fishy and gamey  which I enjoy. Tasted like they fished this fish right out of th waters before cooking and serving.   The salsa is AMAZING...never had salsa this good. Chips had substance to them  something to really chew on. But at the same time  crispy and dense. Awesome pairing with salsa.  I also had the watermelon fresca  which hit the spot after so many of these salty foods...Seemed fresh and nothing but fruit and juice and ice.  Due to the food truck nature of this place  I can t rate the interior or whatever  but it certainly still looked cute and put together  the public seating spaces .   The service is nice.   Disclaimer  I m a NYC girl at heart who has never been to Central America so my standards have been relatively low.
Veracruz All Natural,197,We ate here today and were impressed...multiple food trucks  all Veracruz.  Coldbrew and churros at one  queso at another  tacos at another  juices at another...and I kmow there was yet another.  The watermelon water rocked  as did my chicken taco and quesadilla...great hot sauces  too  and some nice shaded area with tables.  It s worth coming back.
Veracruz All Natural,198,Definitely get the watermelon aqua fresca- so refreshing  I got the chicken and steak tacos. They were pretty good  We shared some guac and salsa which was also quite tasty.
Veracruz All Natural,199,Either we wrote a review for the wrong location last time  which was on Cesar Chavez  or they ve updated that one to here. We ve actually been to Veracruz a bunch of times since then  but to their north location  now closed  because it was near our daughter s daycare. We mainly go for the agua frescas  which we love. That was the impetus for our trip yesterday.  We each picked our own flavor  cucumber  pineapple  and mango. The best was pineapple by far. Against our advice not to get the mango--even though it s a family favorite flavor-wise--our daughter insisted. This is the only flavor that never tastes fresh. The cucumber is great  but our chief complaint is that we had ordered ahead and by the time we got there  all the pulp had risen to the top and it was a pain in the ass to restir the drinks with their paltry straws.  We also got their chips  the crunch  the freshness   and a side of guac and a side of beans. We loved both  but they needed salt. The barbacoa taco was solid albeit greasy and the breakfast one  El Tradicional  was as good as it gets.  Everything was no-touch and since we arrived close to 3  there was only one other picnic bench occupied  so distancing safety was easy. We like this place  and apparently it s the only location doing frescas now  so we ll be back at some point.
Veracruz All Natural,200,Perfectly solid grub. Poblanos breakfast taco got five stars. Pastor four. Mole three - oof  never seen chunk chicken in mole. Fantastic juice as good as Juiceland at 5 stars. Nice staff  cool outdoor area.
Veracruz All Natural,201,This place has some yummy tacos and the homemade chips were delicious. We ordered the grilled steak tacos and they didn t disappoint. I m giving it four stars because we also ordered some drinks and the way they were distributing the drinks seemed disorganized since it took a long time. The food also took longer than what we were told but that s understandable. Overall  great place for some pricey but good tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,202,It s taken me a while to tacobout it  but I finally found the right words to describe Veracruz  fancy-ass tacos.   I came here on a whim  really. I was en route to Downtown on the MetroRail when I saw that I was near one of my bookmarks  so I got off and trekked down the few blocks because I was STARVING. Although it looks sketchy  this area seems like it s growing  and I m sure Veracruz brings in a pretty hip  young crowd.  For a food truck  this place is ballin --it has its own space  patio seating  umbrellas and picnic benches   a ramp--the whole nine yards--even call buzzers  It took about 20 minutes to get my two tacos  but they seemed busy even for a weekday morning.  I had a Migas and an Egg  amp  Chorizo taco off the breakfast menu. The Egg  amp  Chorizo Taco was too spicy for my  mild  tolerance  but flavorful. You ll probably like this if you like it saucy and spicy. Like many people  I absolutely loved the Migas Taco--an explosion of flavors  it was such a fun treat to eat  especially with the crunchy pieces of tortilla chips in the mix. All the ingredients were fresh and made from scratch  so that made the wait worth it.    Not sure if the pricing is standard for tacos in Austin  but they were a bit pricey. Then again  they are a well-known taco spot in Austin and their fresh ingredients justify their prices. Would totally come back here again to get the Migas Taco and try their agua frescas 
Veracruz All Natural,203,Good food but they only do online ordering and it s not easy. You have to sign up and register for a website just to order  even with Apple Pay.
Veracruz All Natural,204,Overall pretty damn good tacos.  In love w the corn tortillas. Huge fan of the migas taco. The chicken mole taco is a great change up.  I d take a pass on the al pastor taco.  Absolutely loveeeee the green salsa spicy af 
Veracruz All Natural,205,The food here is incredible. The Migas tacos are probably the best in the world. Seriously. Then there are the fish tacos  chicken tacos  etc. It s all amazing. I also like that you can order ahead online and the projected pickup time has always been fairly accurate. The only gripe I have is that it s in the Mueller food park which means  hot  eating prime times make it an incredible pain to find a quick spot to park so you can run up and grab your order due to limited parking spots. It s not at all a knock on Veracruz  but it has impacted the frequency for which we would otherwise like to order from them. Other just as amazing food trucks like Paprika and Granny s have easier access where you can at least find a space to park your car for a hot minute while you jump out to scoop up your order during high volume dining times.
Veracruz All Natural,206,You know when you re at a party and someone tells a joke and everyone starts laughing and you don t get it but you laugh anyway because you don t want to be the one person who doesn t get it  Well  that s me trying to understand the hype of this place. I want in on why everyone loves it but I m just over here like   I don t get it. It s not that good.   I love tacos. And I ve been lucky enough to eat tacos in some pretty amazing places. I was informed  however  to truly experience tacos  I must eat at Veracruz All Natural. Even Lonely Planet had this as a must do. So I forked over  20 in Uber rides and took myself to the Veracruz All Natural trailer. Here s what I did enjoy   1. the fact that I showed up at 11 00 and beat the INSANE line that formed at 12 00 while I sat still waiting for the taco order I placed 45 minutes ago. 2. eating outside and the general vibe of the place 3. the watermelon aguas fresca - but what s not to love about watermelon mixed with a metric shit ton of sugar  What I did not love  1. The tacos Allow me to explain - I don t get the hype. The tacos were just ok. I ve combed through reviews about  chew  and  flavor profile.  Here s what I know. I ve had homemade corn tortillas. I have a friend that s kind enough to make them for me for a six pack of beer or if I feed his cat when he s gone for the weekend. His are better and have a lot more flavor. They also don t cost me  5 a piece. The  flavor profiles  of the tacos here were bland. I had the al Pastor  one of my all time favorite tacos. It was the first one I opened and I blindly picked it up and started eating  I m an animal like that . I literally stopped chewing and mouth still full  opened the other tacos to figure out which one I was currently eating. That is how much taste there wasn t. The holy grail of breakfast tacos  the migas originales  also just didn t do it for me. My egg was overdone and the taco tasted more like avocado than anything.  So there you have it. I ll nod and laugh along  but actually  I don t get what everyone else is talking about.
Veracruz All Natural,207,Best food I had in Austin. The breakfast tacos are huge and packed full of so much flavor. I got the poblano Migas and a smoothie. I wish this was closer to where I lived and k would probably eat here daily.
Veracruz All Natural,208,Let me tell you  BEST breakfast taco I ever had  Do yourself a favor tomorrow morning and order a original migas taco  Looking forward to go back to Austin and eat there and try other items on the menu too 
Veracruz All Natural,209,Wow  these tacos were pretty amazing. It s a food truck  and the line can get long. I waited in line for about 30 minutes  but it was definitely worth it    I ordered the Migas taco on a flour tortilla  the fish taco on a flour tortilla and the al pastor taco on a corn tortilla. I also ordered the mango aguafresca. The fish taco was my favorite and it was just so  so good and fresh. They grill the fish right when you order the taco. All of their corn tortillas are homemade. I usually don t like corn tortillas  but I actually liked these. They were softer than the non-homemade ones. Food network has also had Veracruz on TV  and their Migas taco is pretty famous. I would probably add chorizo to that taco if I ordered it again. Finally  the aguafresca was amazing. It literally tasted exactly like mango  and I m sure they blend it fresh  but it s not like a smoothie or juice. This wait is definitely worth it 
Veracruz All Natural,210,One of the better taco places I ve ever been to and a great ambience that builds to the experience   I came to Veracruz because it was close to where I was staying in the area. Veracruz is a white school bus converted to taco-manufacturing machine  basically. It s in a fenced off area with picnic tables with large umbrellas shading the space. I came here twice in the morning  in two days   because it was so delicious the first time and was not disappointed either time. I tried the migas originales and migas poblanas  breakfast tacos  and was surprised at how flavorful these were despite not having any meat. These tacos were fairly large and well-priced too. They have a selection of sauces sitting near the pick-up window as well which are tasty. The salsa looks home-made. They also serve smoothies  which looked pretty popular and tasty  although I did not have a chance to taste any of these when I visited. I also tried the el pastor and fajita steak-- these were a smidge smaller than the breakfast tacos were equally delicious. The meat really packs a punch and is incredibly juicy.   Service is very friendly and there s a small parking lot you can park in if you have a car. I really liked the vibe of this place in the context of East Austin. The vibe here is especially relaxing if you come early in the morning  with the quiet of the surrounding neighborhood and the hustle and bustle of the hunger customers ready to eat here  there s always someone waiting for tacos here . Will definitely re-visit this place if I am ever in East Austin again.
Veracruz All Natural,211,I tried this place many years ago on a trip to Austin.... fell in love with the tacos and breakfast tacos. Now that I live in TX  I visit Veracruz every time I m in Austin. I don t know what their secret is  but this is hands down the best taco place 
Veracruz All Natural,212,Yup  Amazing  Fresh  big portions  gluten free friendly  quick  delicious  I ordered two tacos and could only eat one  The breakfast veggie taco was full of egg whites  carrots  spinach  peppers  mushrooms and a bit of cheese. It was like an egg scramble wrapped in a tortilla and was a great start to the day. My boyfriend tried the Migas  fish and chicken tacos  which were all great. My friends were disappointed by the mole taco  so maybe skip that  otherwise  I recommend trying one of each  but maybe not all at once. The location of the truck is a bit out of the way  in a poorer part of town  but there is a cute patio  perfect for a bite on a nice day  I would definitely come back and prices are spot on  especially for how generous the portions are.
Veracruz All Natural,213,Ordered 5 tacos and a juice to share between me and my boyfriend. We had the El Pastor  Migas  La Reyna  Fajita Steak  and Fish tacos  and the La Bomba juice  orange juice  pineapple  spinach.  If you order La Reyna  definitely recommend eating it first because the cooked vegetables soak the tortilla. We saved it for last and the tortilla was completely soggy.   Our favorite taco was the El Pastor. It was the most flavorful out of all of them. The other tacos lacked any flavor - definitely need sauces so you could taste the tacos  and this is coming from someone who s extremely sensitive to salt and strong flavors.  Overall the tacos were good  but not worth the hype and the hour wait. We ve had better tacos in Mexico City  though that may be an unfair comparison.
Veracruz All Natural,214,Great food    As someone who cannot process dairy I love that they offer a vegan queso that actually tastes like queso   Also  the aguas frescas are
Veracruz All Natural,215,I was here for the breakfast tacos  obviously - and they are totally legit. I don t normally get excited about paying  3.75 for one regular taco-sized taco  but the poblano miga  while made on a base of a normal soft taco-sized tortilla  though I believe made fresh  as it s super fluffy and tasty   is then just completely jam-packed with stuff  so yeah  worth it on size  and obviously also on quality. It is absolutely delicious. I also tried a regular breakfast taco of egg  cheese and cactus  and it was also fantastic - I d be willing to eat vegetarian for a week with no complaints if I were eating food like this.   So  two tacos is a pretty good amount of food  but they actually gave me a free third one by accident  with bacon - I found their bacon too salty  so even more likely I d eat vegetarian if I were here  which  if I lived in the Austin area  I would definitely do frequently . I also tried a bite of my wife s regular not-breakfast pork taco  and thought it was just ok. I definitely recommend sticking to the breakfast tacos  which are what they re known for  for good reason. And make sure to grab some of their delicious creamy hot sauce  which is unfortunately hidden in the back  so it s easy to miss.   I also tried their agua fresca  which is totally worth 4 bucks  because it is  huge   and also clearly fresh made .   I wouldn t be nearly as excited if I d had to stand in a huge long line  though - I was here a little after 2 PM on a Friday  and there was basically no line.
Veracruz All Natural,216,Not Celiac friendly - suceptible to crosscontamination. There are websites that lists vera Cruz tacos as celiac friendly and it is not.  It s a small food truck and they not have a separate grill for their  wheat  flour and corn tortillas and grilled meats.   If you re really sensitive to gluten  I do not recommend this place.  I had a piece of each of the meats and I like the Al pastor was the best. The fish was just as great. The flank steak reminded me of lengua and was much softer than most carne asada I ve had. The chips were crunchy and salsa was well spiced and a good amount of smokey.
Veracruz All Natural,217,Veracruz has possibly the best tacos in the city  but their ordering system is a dumpster fire. It takes too long to make an order  so the line is really long. They say you ll get a text message  but the text came 20 minutes after my order was ready. My drink wasn t included. I had to track people down  show them my receipt and wait another 5 minutes while they made the drink I d ordered 50 minutes before. Dumpster fire.
Veracruz All Natural,218,The migas breakfast taco is so so good with the free salsas on the side. Simple ingredients but executed well. Definitely going back and trying out some from their lunch menu 
Veracruz All Natural,219,Yummy yummy yummy Sooooo gooooood These tacos were fresh  delicious  flavorful and the perfect quick bite for a friday night.  I got the al pastor taco which was pork with pineapple. Alittle greasy and heavy but so tasty  Not too sweet where the pineapple overpowered which is good and the pork had alot of flavor.  Than i got a grilled chicken taco which was with el fresco  avocado and onion and it was perfect.  Tacos are alittle small but they fill it with all the goodness.  We also got a chicken quesadilla. One of best quesadillas ive ever had. Super cheesy and crispy but soft at the same time.   Environment wise  cute outdoor seating in a closed off park type place.  Its alittle out of the way in the back streets of nowhere but definitely high on the list for taco places to try  Def recommend  Didnt take pics cuz i was hungry and it looked so good so thats tellin ya somethin  Phone did NOT eat first this time
Veracruz All Natural,220,Waited for 30 min for my food to come home and find out that I did not received everything I ordered    Very disappointed.
Veracruz All Natural,221,Best tacos EVA  Wow so good. Usually get the al pastor and a chicken quesadilla. So much food. Can never finish but my stomach is full and happy.   The place gets crowded but sometimes you can find a spot. Apparently this place is known for its breakfast tacos and maybe it s bc I m not a huge fan of bfast tacos or migas but I go for the regular tacos.   The wait is about 20 min or so  If you re starving get chips and guac. I remember the guac being ok. For some reason coming from CA the guac here is very liquidy and mas o menos
Veracruz All Natural,222,Tried the Migas  Reyna and al Pastor.  I wanted to try the Migas on both flour and corn  but when I got them  I got 2 flour  though I ordered 1 of each .  I guess I could have told them to correct it but I didn t.  Add some of the salsa that is under the tent - be careful bc some pack HEAT
Veracruz All Natural,223,Delicious food. Nice seating area with shades  Price is very decent  There is a juice bar next to the truck with delicious thirst quenching selection
Veracruz All Natural,224,Trust their reviews. Best food we had in Austin. We got the chicken steak and pork taco and the quesadilla. Sooo good. Great proportions plenty of food and not stingy on the sides of sour cream guac or anything. We also got the salsa and queso with chips and their was plenty. Definitely a must try. Also there was plenty of tables and space to enjoy your meal 
Veracruz All Natural,225,Came here with some friends for lunch  The seating area is beautiful and had lots of shade which is great especially for the incoming summer heat ..  We all ordered tacos which you have a choice of either corn or flour. You can t go wrong with either of them  so pick what you like. I tried both the original Miga s and al pastor. They were booooth delicioussss.   Both of them were adequately priced and filling  so I definitely got my money s worth. The pineapple in the pastor was sweet and juicy with the meat being tender. The migas was good toooo. Try not to let it sit for so long or else the chips will get too soggy   .   For salsa  you have the red sauce and the green sauce. I strongly prefer the green sauce for the underlying heat while the red one is like a punch in the face.   I can t wait to come back  I m probably going to try the Agua s Fresca.
Veracruz All Natural,226,My favorite taco place in Austin  I love love love the Migas Poblanos taco. I think getting it fresh from the kitchen is way better than getting it from take out. The crispness of the chips they add into the taco is so good. I really wish they kept the 183 location but glad they opened the Tarrytown location. Wish they were open late as well but I ll take what I can get 
Veracruz All Natural,227,I don t know about waiting in the hot sun  but it was certainly worth waiting in chill drizzling weather. The migas taco was divine and the el pastor was tasty too.
Veracruz All Natural,228,While my group and I were waiting to order and eat at la bbq  we saw there was a nearby taco bus dishing out apparently a top 5 taco marketed by the food network. Located in east Austin we ordered 4 diff tacos between our group to hold us over this 1 hr wait. First off the top 5 rated taco called the Migas.....it was good. Don t think it is justified by the ranking  rating  or hype....just was a good vegetarian taco in my opinion  I thought the al pastor taco was way more flavorful. We also got the chicken mole and fish tacos which were just ok. Chicken was nothing special  taco you could probably save money and make at home and the fish taco was a bit too fishy.   Those working at the east Austin location were rude too. Maybe the guy was irritated with the questions being asked....it was our first time  of course we will have questions about the food were about to order...  Also asked for water and if there were any sauces or hot sauce and he definitely seemed frustrated or annoyed....anyway  for the price  not really worth the food or experience. They also offer corn or flour tortilla options. There pretty quick with making the tacos food as well but there s only two guys who speak English  so if you have a question  be prepared to wait until they free up from what there doing or who there  helping 
Veracruz All Natural,229,The migas are worth coming here alone. I don t even like migas  but this blew me away. Fresh egg and avocado  crunchy tortilla chips  a onion tomato mixture that tastes homemade  and just the right amount of cheese to tie it together.    The pastor was good  but not quite what I m use to. They were cubes of pork rather than grounded. The pineapples were there  but much more in the backdrop than in the forefront. Some pieces of pork were chewy  while others were melt in your mouth.    I don t normally order fish tacos  but I decided to give this a spin. The description I saw on the menu said  minimal masterpiece . They re not far off. There is a serene harmony with this composition. The tilapia stands firm  yet in contemplation amongst its subtle yet enhancing sides. The creamy avocado gives it depth  the fruit and pick de Gallo gives it a bright freshness  while all blending into the tilapia. Don t e Percy this to be a crazy flavored  fusion fish dish  but rather a reflection on the simplistic majesty of the tilapia.    The flour tortillas are done right. Firm yet pillow soft. They provide a structure while never burdening the jaw with weight or density. They also take on the oils of the dish quite well.     I walked in expecting the usual  but I was pleasantly surprised. Swing by and grab yourself some tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,230,Amazingly amazingggggggg      Can t wait to return  This will be our go to spot when visiting Austin. Definitely a favorite    
Veracruz All Natural,231,Amazing food  Every time I come to Austin I have to make a stop. I love the aguas frescas they have.
Veracruz All Natural,232,The fish taco is my absolute favorite here.  We also tried the migas poblanos and la reyna.  The chips and salsa were great additions but wasn t spicy so I added their smoky red sauce to mix it up and it was the perfect amount of spiciness.  Service was a bit slow for a Friday lunch but  we still got our food within 20-30 min after ordering. Parking is small but quick turnaround.
Veracruz All Natural,233,Holy breakfast tacos  Batman    The line moved much slower than I expected  and the order got a little messed up but hot damn - these are the best breakfast tacos ever. The migas was really good but I think my personal favorite was the Al Pastor. Or the chorizo. Or the bacon and potato. Crap.  Go here 
Veracruz All Natural,234,This place was a quick 5 minute walk from our AirBnb so we decided to check it out around 11am on a Saturday. Food truck in a pretty deserted lot with a good amount of tables. Line looked pretty long  wrapped around to the gated entrance  but we decided to wait it out thinking it would be 20 mins tops. Little did we know  we would be waiting for OVER AN HOUR. The best part  We went to the liquor store before and I was stuck holding the case of White Claws...   It was too late to turn back now and we were discussing how these better be the BEST tacos we ve had in our lives... and it did not disappoint.  Among the three of us  we tried the grilled fish  steak  al pastor  and Migas originales. Corn tortilla is definitely the star and they fill them up quite a bit. Definitely go for 3. While the tacos were amazing  the real star are the agua frescas. I got the mango and my sister got the watermelon. I d go back and wait in that line all over again just for the drinks....maybe.  If you re with good company  the time passes fairly quickly. Worth the visit  just be prepared to wait   Ps. It was a freak weekend and we were waiting under comfortable overcast skies and 65 degree weather. This review may be a lot different if we were baking under scorching Austin heat...
Veracruz All Natural,235,Dropped by around 11am  Saturday. There were no parking spaces available on the lot so we parked on the street next to the gas station that is near.   There was a line. We probably waited about 35 mins. They text you when your order is ready. Food was ready within 5 minutes.  They have a sauce station on the side so be sure to pack your to go sauces   Indoor seating is limited but it s all shaded. If you want to eat there  be prepared for some community seating.   I ordered the mijos originales  mijos poblanos  fish tacos  beef fajita  and the pork.  Everything was excellent     Well worth the wait 
Veracruz All Natural,236,They were out of the chicken mole tacos but they had enough options. Go here solely for the tacos. They are absolutely delicious. The guacamole  not so much.
Veracruz All Natural,237,I have been a loyal customer for a very long time  Today I was extremely disappointed and treated horribly  I have yet to speak with management and have not received no call back  My whole order was messed up and The lady who took my order doesn t want to admit that she made a mistake and insisted that I bring in my tacos for a full refund. Why should I have to drive 20 min out of my way to get my refund   I was talked with disrespect and attitude  I will never be back  
Veracruz All Natural,238,Straight up  one of the best taco trucks I ve ever had. I m extremely impressed by the food especially since I am from Chicago. The  chicken mole was so flavorful and an intense sauce I ve never experienced. Definitely need to try because I was a little afraid to try it after hearing it was mixed with spices including a chocolate flavor but it was amazing  one of the best chicken tacos I ve ever had. I also got the fajita steak taco which was with cilantro  onion  queso fresco  and slices of avacado   Also super good. Definitely need to drizzle with the light green sauce  free  which adds a lot of flavor  also a sauce I ve never tried before. We also got the appetizer with salsa and chips and the chips were AUTHENTIC AF. Can t wait to visit Austin again and come here again   
Veracruz All Natural,239,This is a taco food truck with interesting outdoor seating.   Good but not great  unpopular opinion .   Would put taco deli above Veracruz due to the variety  price  and seating options.
Veracruz All Natural,240,I liked that all ordering is done online due to COVID. The Migas breakfast tacos were a hit along with the green juice. Classic Austin food truck vibe. No frills  just great food and service.
Veracruz All Natural,241,Oddly enough the next three times I have had their fish tacos left me disappointed. Its almost as the first time was a run of good luck. The fish tacos were skimpy and shoddy. Perhaps it has to do with the timing or of how busy they are.
Veracruz All Natural,242,Great stop for delicious full of flavor tacos. We got a grilled chicken taco which was with el fresco  avocado and onion and it was perfect. Tacos are a little small but they fill it with all the goodness. We also got a chicken quesadilla. One of best quesadillas ive ever had. Super cheesy and crispy but soft at the same time. Good service  good food.
Veracruz All Natural,243,MIGAS  MIGAS  and more MIGAS.  Scorchin  heat  fire tacos. Absolutely loved having breakfast here. Wish I d shown up earlier to skip the   45 minute wait  but the tacos were 1000  worth it. There s not much seating available while you wait and picnic tables are quickly taken by large parties so stake out a spot as soon as you arrive   What can I say that hasn t already been said  The Migas are amazing and I still dream about them  etc etc. They re so good  they almost make Al Pastor  one of my go-to s  look bad.   The smoothies  amp  aguas frescas here are so underrated  The Ms. Maritza Smoothie is crazy refreshing and a unique flavor combo  watermelon kiwi . Order a large  you ll love it   Can t wait to stop by next time I m in Austin 
Veracruz All Natural,244,The best part was the Traditional breakfast taco. Queso and salsa verde was not worth it. Way better queso and salsa so many other places in Austin. The red salsa they gave for the tacos was actually gross. I have never had a red salsa I didnt like and mistakenly put it on my taco before tasting it. I ended up scraping it off. The aqua fresca definitely had fresh  real fruit in it  so if you like that kind of thing  it might be worth it for you.
Veracruz All Natural,245,I came here for my last night in Austin. It was online order only at the time. I had two tacos  they are not that big for the price  but delicious. I also got a quesadilla and a blended drink. Overall the food was a good size  but not really for the price. More for a diet. But I would come back here in a heart beat.
Veracruz All Natural,246,Have to post another five star review for my favorite taco place. They offer delivery and the tacos arrive hot  neat  correct  and delicious with the right amount of salsa and limes. Guess I have a new weekly lunch habit.
Veracruz All Natural,247,After a night on Rainey Street  this place is insanely good for recovery food. I had to try one of their agua frescas  I went with a pineapple agua fresca and knew this place would be delicious after the first sip. It was cold  a little sweet and the perfect summer beverage. The Migas taco is good  especially with extra sauce. The al pastor was even better  It had a little kick.
Veracruz All Natural,248,Breakfast tacos are a must in Austin  Texas and eating them from a food truck just reinforces the fact. The best in the city are from Veracruz All Natural  don t sleep in too late because they are only open through 3PM.  Walk up assess the menu and order  you ll be handed a buzzer.  Get the  MIGAS   they will change your life. Eggs  tortilla chips  avocado  pico de gallo  and Monterey jack cheese for  3.50  these masterful creations are consider one of the top 5 tacos in America. Crunchy  creamy  a little spicy  and obscenely delicious. Well worthy of their title  be sure to adorn them with your choice of salsa. Don t forget the bebidas. Nothing follows a spicy salsa like a Mango Tango smoothie  made with low fat yogurt and fresh fruit so you don t have to feel so bad. There is no way you ll leave here feeling anything but amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,249,Seating is cool. Aqua Fresca is YUM. Tacos are decent.  Tacos gotta be damn good for another star and I wasn t blown away by the flavors.  3-3.50 for a little taco. Gotta order 3 to be full...
Veracruz All Natural,250,When I rolled into the unpaved lot where Veracruz All Natural s bus was parked  I was a little bit apprehensive. It was early  I almost missed the turn because the blue sign had very light lettering and was a bit small  and the crows on the trees were so loud and aggressive that I was afraid I would lose an eye trying to eat my taco.  Seriously  scary.   But the migas are not to be missed. This was my first time ever having migas and now I know what s been missing in my breakfast taco life - tortilla chips. And handmade tortillas. These breakfast tacos were good. Because the tortillas are handmade  they are resilient to the sogginess that a typical taco is. It was able to soak up all the juices from meat  pico de gallo  eggs  and salsa and create juicy but intact bites. The tortilla chips give it a crunchy texture in one bite and a chewy texture in another  making it interesting to eat from the beginning to end. You will definitely want to get more than one.  I also tried a cactus and sausage breakfast taco. And by sausage  they mean hotdogs. Just so you know. The texture of cactus is a lot like green pepper  only the flavor is a bit more sour with a sweet aftertaste and the texture a bit more slimy. I liked it. It s like green pepper s more complicated cousin.  The tacos are a bit small  I d definitely recommend ordering more than 1. The line really builds up  so go early if you don t want to wait too long in line or for your food. They make everything fresh  so it s worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,251,Veracruz has great tacos. They are a bit fancier than your average fare so they are priced accordingly. Service is quite slow but you can always order ahead online. Their aqua frescas come in a super sized cup.   I m not a fan of their masa for the corn tortillas. In the fish taco  one of my tortillas broke apart almost immediately. Their flour tortillas are much better. But  it pains my heart not to eat corn tortillas as I grew up on LA street tacos. I wouldn t consider these to be authentic but they are tasty.   Lastly  I think their presentation could be better for dine in  as they come wrapped up individually in aluminum foil -- which is both wasteful and ugly. It would be easier  more environmentally friendly  and aesthetically pleasing  to have the tacos fanned out on a plate. Not to mention for 3-5 dollar tacos  they should look pretty darn good as they say   you eat with your eyes first    notigworthy
Veracruz All Natural,252,I give it 2 starts cause of the food being good and the first two times visiting and it being perfect.   Let s say we went for our third time and now see that  they charge the same amount but cut the quesadilla portion by 75 . Then I go and very nicely and discreetly  I ask what happened to the portion size. The young gentleman responded with  that how it s always been . So basically my asking that question was just waiting breath.   Don t got there if you want a lot of food. Portion sizes are reduced drastically  and they will act as if that s how it s always been  I won t be returning and pissed that I spent my money with them.
Veracruz All Natural,253,Incredible tacos   I got the al pastor  chicken mole  and steak tacos and they were all super good. Their salsas are delicious and have a nice kick to them. The guac was so fresh and full of flavor.   I have no complaints about this place I just wish I was able to have it whenever I want 
Veracruz All Natural,254,Hands down  the best tacos I ever ate in my life. I ordered the Fish  Migas  and Fajita Chicken tacos. While all three choices were delicious  my favorite taco would have to be the Migas. I only managed to take one picture of the food  because I couldn t stop eating  I would highly recommend checking Veracruz if you re visiting Austin. I m still thinking about those tacos and it s been two days since I ate there  I also ordered a mango orange smoothie and it was the perfect drink to wash down the food. I would warn people that there is limited seating at this location  so please arrive early if traveling with a large group.
Veracruz All Natural,255,They only do online orders and be prepared to wait an hour for your taco to be made on a Sunday morning. Canceled order. Got refund after arriving. The original location on Cesar Chavez seemed to handle more people with minimal wait.
Veracruz All Natural,256,Yes yes yes.  Vegan tacos are close to the best in Austin. Wow.  Great menu.  Great staff.  Great startup and success story.
Veracruz All Natural,257,Absolutely top notch tacos. Homemade tortillas  awesome salsa and hot sauces. The steak fajita taco and El Pastor would stack up against any in the city. Grab a Mexican come and enjoy.
Veracruz All Natural,258,I was under the impression that these were going to be life changing because my brother had told me so many years ago when he was at UT that these were the best tacos in Austin. They re good don t get me wrong  but certainly not the BEST. I got the al pastor  a torta as well as a fish taco and one of the break feast tacos the la reya. The fish taco was excellent  but the al pastor was not to my taste  it was too saucy. But the torta was very well worth as it had ham. The sauces are A1 though  recommend the avocado.
Veracruz All Natural,259,Tacos are easy to make well  but hard to make exceptional. This trailer parked by a parking lot off Cesar Chavez manages to make some freakin  amazing tacos for like  2- 4 a pop. There s a nice mini-picnic area right outside the truck with a few covered tables to help fight the relentless Texan heat. If that doesn t work  one of the large agua frescas will do the trick for sure.  The tacos are seriously large  2-3 should be good for most people  and come individually wrapped in tin foil. Oh  and don t forget to grab some of the hot sauce from the counter -- the habanero one is dope. I had the Migas  Fish  and Steak. All were solid but the fish and migas were exceptional  and I wish I had space in my stomach for one more of each.
Veracruz All Natural,260,First breakfast taco but best breakfast anything I ve ever had. I don t like scrambled eggs  but this stuff is so flavorful. The chips mixed into the eggs offer a really nice crispy texture.   The smoothies are also really nice. The Queen had a lot of berry seeds. Definitely fresh.
Veracruz All Natural,261,Honestly  this food truck has completely changed my mindset toward breakfast tacos. As someone from Texas I grew up with breakfast tacos every Sunday morning...so I thought eh  what could be special about that. The migas orginales breakfast taco shattered that thought completely. Hands down the best breakfast taco I have had  ever. The flavors and different textures are so wonderfully balanced  I never knew I needed this in my life until my visit  and now I understand why people wait in lines in 100  degree weather for a breakfast taco. I highly recommend and will definitely be back.  Pro tips  1  if you re starving after that wait  make sure to order the chips and guacamole. They give them to you as soon as you order so you have something to munch on while you wait on the tacos  2  you can ask for one agua fresca  highly recommend the mango  to be split into two cups so you can share that goodness with someone you love. Or you can always just get the one 32oz fresca for yourself  because treat yo self. 3  If waiting in lines in the Texas heat isn t your thing they also have 2 brick and motar locations in Austin  so you can at least wait in the AC.
Veracruz All Natural,262,Tacos are pretty good but the quesadillas are amazing. I could really eat one every day. The people working there are friendly and the service is consistent. Great place for a quick lunch or breakfast tacos
Veracruz All Natural,263,Saturday morning in Austin and I had to get some breakfast tacos.  Veracruz All Natural appeared on my radar so I had to try it out.  I got one breakfast taco and one classic taco.   For the breakfast taco I went with the egg and chorizo.  Eggs are slightly overcooked  I prefer my eggs soft and slightly runny  but these eggs are slightly rubbery. Chorizo is okay  but doesn t pack a potent spicy and savory flavor. It was also very finely minced  which made it stand out less as an individual ingredient. Taco is handmade with great corn flavor  but was falling apart under the moisture of all the filling. Despite its shortcomings  this is a satisfactory taco  just not a superior one.   Al Pastor is smothered in sauce. Pork is juicy and tender. Fresh cilantro  onion and avocado add herbal and textural nuance. The corn taco held together here  and again has a great homemade quality. This is a good taco  and gets a solid recommendation.    Overall  Veracruz provides a good taco and is worth trying out.
Veracruz All Natural,264,Visiting from San Diego  where we OBSESS over our tacos  amp  I LOVE THE MIGAS TACO. THE FLAVORS  THE TEXTURE - all breakfast taco dreams came true this morning. Everyone here is friendly  amp  patient  even though I came hella early in the morning. I wasn t even hungry but I had to order a second one for the road.   THANK YOU SO MUCH VERACRUZ 
Veracruz All Natural,265,Look no further because this is the best place for breakfast tacos. Everything about  their food is excellent. But the handmade tortillas is where it s at  The green salsa is delicious as well. If you re not from Austin and you re hesitant about trying a Migas or a breakfast tacos  take it from  a skeptical tourist like myself  give this place a try. I crave it everyday that I am back in Cali and it s so sad that we can t find a place comparable to Veracruz.
Veracruz All Natural,266,Good tacos not worth the wait   There s been a lot of hype around this place so I had to check it out  it s a cool little food truck nestled in east Caesar Chavez. I ve been twice before to check it out but was disappointed to find a 45 minute wait so I left. Today I thought I would wake up early and brave the cold.   I arrived around 9am with no line   just one person in front of me ordering. I over heard her say it will be 25 minutes. Now Their motto is there is fast food and then there is fresh food.  But 25 minutes for breakfast tacos is a bit much.   I ordered one of each of the breakfast tacos. Don t get me wrong they are good tacos but no where near the best breakfast tacos in town. They do have some healthier options  lots of fresh veggies  chilies  avocados  and egg whites. But nothing too special here.   To sum it up again   Good Tacos just not worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,267,Didn t disappoint  Migas and the tradicional were soo good. Painless ordering online as well. This is a must for anyone looking for authentic breakfast tacos. Will be back for the rest of the menu for sure 
Veracruz All Natural,268,My husband said  these are the best but there s going to be the a line at this time of day  Miraculously we found a shaded parking spot at Radio and there was no line at Veracruz I tried the LA Reyna and the fish tacos. The  LA reyna was so Savory --full of mushrooms  pico  red peppers  egg whites and spinach. It was just a perfect combination and the fish taco was very good also. About 5 minutes into our tacos the line was 10 long so be prepared to wait. This place is no secrer.
Veracruz All Natural,269,We walked past this food truck and got a whiff of whatever they were cooking. On our way back  we decided to give it a shot since it smelt amazing. Not sure how long we were in line but it did take awhile.   We got the steak fajitas with corn tortillas and they were  awesome. I did find it a bit dry but they have a bunch of house made sauces that paired perfectly.
Veracruz All Natural,270,All their breakfast tacos are Vegan. They tasted alright.. the salsa was what made it. There are better taco trucks out there if you re not on restricted diet.  Service was fine  but the wait was a bit long.
Veracruz All Natural,271,I m not sure what the hype is about but it tasted like average tacos. I stopped by on an early morning around 9 00 a.m. I ordered a few breakfast tacos. I did not find anything special about the tacos. It is something that I could ve easily made  at home. The tacos were also a bit messy to eat because it was falling out everywhere. The stand out of this meal was the fresh watermelon slushie. That was the M.V.P. of the meal.
Veracruz All Natural,272,Food was healthy and delicious. Loved the vegan queso  and I m not vegan . Fresh juice and breakfast tacos...fav breakfast and the food park it is in is really cute as well. Look forward to dining there one day when it s not so hot and covidy outside. I ordered online and they had orders on a table under a heat lamp...easy to grab and go.
Veracruz All Natural,273,Migas poblanos - YES get this. Yum    Migas originales - it s a breakfast taco... nothing special or mind blowing. Don t get the hype.  But the migas poblanos -- so much good flavor  I highly recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,274,CHECK YOUR FOOD IF YOU HAVE DIETARY RESTRICTIONS      My fianc  and I ordered a mole chicken taco and instead of chicken they gave us steak   We didn t realise until after a few bites. After asking the employees what happened  they said they substitute steak when they run out of chicken. This is completely unacceptable and eating steak is against our religion. Unacceptable mistakes and explanation and terrible customer service.
Veracruz All Natural,275,I think I loved the aqua frescas more than my tacos. I had the pineapple agua fresca and it was so refreshing and naturally sweet. They also had mango  strawberry  cucumber  orange  etc and even smoothies.  For the tacos I had to try the migas which some locals in line told my friends and I we have to try while in Austin. It had a scramble egg with avocado  pico de gallo  and then tortilla chips.  The fish taco is another recommendation where the tilapia is lightly breaded. And served with a creamy maybe chipotle sauce on the side. And chopped mango salsa and cabbage.  Then I had to try the steak taco with the works on top.   The sauces on the side is what makes the tacos even better. I loved the green sauce. Creamy with a kick  I put it seriously on everything. My friends got the barbacoa quesadilla.
Veracruz All Natural,276,Migos original taco   flavorful  delicious Berry smoothie   delicious  refreshing  great size
Veracruz All Natural,277,10 10 would recommend. 5 stars. Yes. This may be my favorite review yet I was excited to write it the moment I ate there. I researched the must eat at places in Austin and this was a frequent name on most lists. We stopped by for breakfast and joined the line  long but not terrible . We looked at the menu while we waited and I decided on a Mango Aguas Frescas  Migas Originales and Migas Poblanas  chips and guac. The Migas Originales was definitely my favorite between the two but I loved literally everything I ate. The chips were fresh and homemade  still warm  and tasted like heaven. The guac was amazing and also clearly home made with hearty chunks of avocado.  The corn tortillas are house made and they source their flour locally. Both are toasted  warm  and delicious. The Mango Aguas Frescas...I will dream about this drink until I make it back to Austin. it was indescribably good. It was like a fresh squeezed juice with small chunks of mango and I just honestly couldnt get enough.    I in fact loved it so much that I went out of my way to make a second stop while in Austin for lunch one day. I again got the Mango Aguas Frescas  of course  I split a chicken quesadilla  a fajita chicken taco and fajita steak taco and some more chips and guac. I recommend lunch to but breakfast was definitely my favorite.   There is a decent amount of seating outside at picnic tables and under umbrellas. If you go at a hot time definitely plan to wait but it is worth it. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did 
Veracruz All Natural,278,This was our first stop in Austin  While I thought the bbq was going to be the thing I missed about Austin its actually the tacos  Migas are an Austin staple and Veracruz does them right. They also have a nice variety of fresh juice which is perfect in that Texas sun
Veracruz All Natural,279,Tacos are great  but is it a must  Not too sure  maybe it is because I did not get breakfast tacos  Hardly folks right before closing on a Saturday afternoon. Food took a bit longer than expected  so prepare to wait. There are picnic tables to sit and eat  but I am unsure what it would be like when it is really busy.  Chicken Taco tasted great  but texture wise the chicken was a bit too dry for me. Al Pastor was way better  I could have eaten 3 of those. Watermelon Agua Frescas was perfect in this Austin heat  so definitely get one to pair with your tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,280,I was looking for authentic tacos when I came to Austin and so glad Yelp lead me here. Absolutely delicious tacos and so incredibly cheap. The tacos are on pretty large tortillas and absolutely stuffed with ingredients. I ordered a fish taco so g with the mug as taco and while both were fabulous  I actually preferred the fresh flavors of the fish taco. Highly recommending stopping here but do beware be parking situation is pretty tight.
Veracruz All Natural,281,The tacos from this food truck were the best tasting taco I have ever had. They have breakfast tacos that are unbelievable I couldn t even tell you what was on it. A mix of eggs. Potato s avoxados and more. I got 2 tacos the 2 most popular and a mango drink they make by hand. Line was out of the gate and wait was about 25 minutes at about 11am. Worth the wait. A place that you must try. Tacos are about  3.50 and they are damn gooD. Very impressed.
Veracruz All Natural,282,I ve had breakfast tacos before and didn t like them but I m SO GLAD I tried again  Veracruz has THE BEST BREAKFAST TACOS  I miss them so much  You can choose what goes in  sort of a la carte  Great size got full of of two. I didn t exactly love the outside seating. Lots of birds and weathered  but the food is definitely a go to      ALSO  The directions are off. It will get you close but we had to do some circling to find it 
Veracruz All Natural,283,My friend said that Veracruz is a MUST in Austin so we came early for breakfast tacos right before going to Hamilton Pools. They were worth waking up early for  I ordered the migas and the al pastor. Both were great  but I was feeling the migas more. The mix of eggs and tortilla chips were the perfect combo. Also  I loved that each of their tacos came with a slice of avocado. Even better than that  were their salsas. They have a couple creamier sauces and one salsa with chunks of avocado. I ve never seen that before but anything with salsa and avocado can t be bad and it wasn t   Veracruz is located right next to a Shell with limited parking spaces. We ve driven past Veracruz several times during the day and there was always a long line. It seems like early mornings are the best time to go since there was hardly anyone there when we went. Overall  I think Veracruz  may be some serious competition for nearby Juan in a Million for breakfast tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,284,I came here for breakfast tacos and I ordered a juice. Everything is delicious. I don t think you can go wrong here. Arrive early and be prepared to wait. It is worth it  
Veracruz All Natural,285,Steak tacos are  thumbs up emoji  Strawberry agua fresca are  bomb emoji  AF All their salsas are  100 emoji   Really can t go wrong w Veracruz tacos. The taco was perfect  just the right amount of steak  cilantro  onions. Not too big and not too small. You know how I know this  The taco was a substantial size while still allowing me to wrap the tortilla  not just fold  and almost nothing fell out  only an onion or two .  The Agua Fresca..... Oh my Lord. Sooooooo refreshing and not too sweet and no artificial taste at all. And they serve it in a huge cup. You can get a Starbucks drink  half the size  for the same price or more.  So worth.
Veracruz All Natural,286,We came here based on the yelp reviews but these tacos were overrated in my opinion.  Barbacoa was the best I had but was bordering on being too salty to eat.  The steak taco was pretty tough and not tender at all.  Our experience here was pretty ordinary and would not return.
Veracruz All Natural,287,First Austin food truck experience and what a great choice we made. I mean come on  breakfast tacos   What a revelation.  Naturally we had to try the Migas taco  eggs  crushed tortilla chips  avocado  cheese   which has been recognized in the  top 5 best tacos in America . What an achievement  I m don t think I will every forget that first bite... these tacos are legit     MUST TRY.   The fish taco here is also pretty damn good. Sometimes a fish taco can lack flavor as typically tilapia is a bland fish  but this was far from that However  the Al Pastor taco was a bit disappointing.   Next to the pick up point is a little table where you collect sauce. One is green  the other is red and there is also a salsa. I ve had both green and red said with Mexican food before but there are something else. So punchy and full of flavor. They really complete the taco. And the salsa is unreal.   To summarize  those Migas tacos are so damn good I came back the next day. To fulfill all your breakfast taco dreams  go here  
Veracruz All Natural,288,Alton Brown ranks this place as the best Migas taco in America and he isn t wrong  I like that the food truck has plenty of shaded seating around it. I also think it s a perfect combo of the wild flavors of Torchy s but without the grease  amp  keeps the ingredients fresh with great tortillas like Taco Joint.
Veracruz All Natural,289,I have to say after viewing quite a bit of travelers blogs before coming here I m super pleased with the experience.  Even though we waited quite a bit of time for tacos  it was worth the wait.  Highly recommend this place if you are in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,290,MOST WHOLESOME TACOS IN ALL THE LAND.  I had the pleasure of trying Veracruz All Natural the other day when I stopped by one of my favorite coffee shops that was serving their breakfast tacos - Fleet Coffee - and I was blown away. Their tacos are so soft and it tastes like every ingredient has been picked fresh from a garden that very day and used in your taco. The Migas Poblanas taco stole my heart with its soft eggs and sweet peppers  among other ingredients   but I m sure there s much more to love on the menu  and I can t wait to give it a try. This place is certainly a 10 10 for me  but if you don t trust my judgement  just know that their Migas taco was named a Top 5 Taco in America   
Veracruz All Natural,291,Decent tacos  I m normally a meat taco gal  but I decided to go with the more breakfast friendly tacos when I came around Austin for a friends birthday. Tacos are a bit small for what you pay  3-4  for a breakfast taco  usually a tiny bit cheaper elsewhere  but you can definitely tell the level of care they put into making them. Not the first place I would go when the craving strikes  but definitely up there 
Veracruz All Natural,292,I found my favorite tacos here  They are authentic and flavorful. This place has 3 unique home made sauces to add on  salsa  green chili sauce and red chilli sauce. I can t handle much spice but they were so tasty on their own. The tacos I tried were the fish taco  pulled pork taco and beef taco. The fish taco has more ingredients than the other two and I ended up ordering this twice. The other two taco s are also really good  I liked the beef better. The beef quesadilla was our favorite  and would highly recommend trying along with the tacos. In regards to drinks  the agua fresca drinks I tried was cucumber  watermelon  and mango.  They make it fresh and tastes like flavoured water. In terms of strength of flavor from strongest to least  it would be cucumber  watermelon and lastly mango.
Veracruz All Natural,293,Gimme all  Yes  all their tacos  with guacamole and chips. I m not sure how torchys is more popular. This food truck is the answer to tacos . Period. Please do yourself a favor- order guac and chips. I never ordered them until a friend did and I tried. I was momentarily ashamed of myself for missing out on all that guac the n number of times I was here. Praise the person who establishes this food truck  
Veracruz All Natural,294,Great tacos that definitely are a bit pricy but well worth the costT. Be prepared to spend a good amount if you want to be full   2-3 tacos   Migas Poblano Taco was hyped up on Yelp but honestly fell a little bit flat - the egg was not that flavorful unique  and I think I was supposed to dip it in a sauce to give it the flavor that it needed rather than eat it solo.  Every other taco  Ranging from the La Reyna  vegetarian taco was really well-cooked vegetables   to the Fish Al Pastor Fajita Steak  the tacos are absolutely delicious. Probably some of the best tacos I have had so far in Texas  unless you re talking about  1-2 Mexican street tacos which are honestly in a different level of competition.   Tip s   Parking here is very limited  several spaces   and it can take a while to get food. Be ready to get here early if you want to avoid the line  Also  if you re getting the agua fresca  ask if they can split it in 2 if you re with another person - the single drink by itself is a lot more than you think.
Veracruz All Natural,295,Veracruz All Natural has some pretty good tacos  but I ll admit that mine didn t quite compete with what I m used to in Dallas.   Star 1  How were the service and atmosphere   It s difficult for a food cart to really portray an atmosphere  but Veracruz has friendly people and reasonably fast service. I ordered  got my number  was seated  and had my tacos maybe ten minutes later. What more could I ask for  Star Granted.   Star 2  How were the portions relative to the cost   Some of my favorite tacos back in Dallas come in just under the  2.00 mark  and my favorite street tacos from Sugar Skull Cafe   a href  http   www.yelp.com biz sugar-skull-cafe-dallas  yelp.com biz sugar-skull   a   come in at  2.25. Veracruz upsells things a bit by charging  2.00 for breakfast tacos and  2.50 for regular tacos  which  in all honesty  is a bit expensive. Sure  these tacos are sizable as you can see in the pics  but in that I m not receiving an atmosphere of any kind am I really getting what I ve paid for here  After much deliberation  I decided that had Veracruz charged a cent over  2.50 for their street tacos I d have a real issue  but with the breakfast tacos being only  2.00  that brings the average down to  2.25  which is fine. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4  How was the food   So I snagged two tacos  and one was good while the other not so much. I ll start with the corn tortillas  which I was a big fan of. The flavor and fact that they were freshly made complimented my first barbacoa taco nicely  and kudos to Veracruz for using generous portions of tasty meats in addition to the standard cilantro and onions.   The breakfast taco on the other hand  sausage and egg  was a real disappointment. The eggs were flavorless and a bit runny while the sausage tasted no different from standard cut up oscar meyer sausage. I won t claim that was actually the case  but this was a weak taco. One good one bad  Single Star Granted.   Star 5  Would you eat here every day if you could   Veracruz isn t bad  but in a state where tacos are king  my experience didn t quite live up to the competition. Either a better price point or stronger breakfast tacos  mix it up with some triple ingredient options   would really do the place some good. No Star Granted.
Veracruz All Natural,296,Great service  very covid conscious safety measures  and polite. Got my order on time and both the horchata and carne asada tacos were amazing  I also tried the vegan queso and it was delicious although there s no beating real cheese. Definitely recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,297,Hands down the best vegetarian tacos in Austin. They just tasted so authentic and the burst of flavor in every ingredient was what I needed. I was skeptical about the lack of black beans in the taco but I didn t even miss them. The veggies went perfectly with the flavors even the roasted carrot pieces  We went here twice in the span of two days because these tacos just couldn t be beat anywhere else. My mouth still waters just thinking about them.... I know that sounds made up but it s actually the truth.
Veracruz All Natural,298,So. Good.  Food  Delicious. All the breakfast tacos  so cheap too    steak with the works  migas migas migas  and the chicken mole. Everything is good. And fresh. And good. Cannot emphasize how good this place is. Having only been to Austin twice  and in both trips  I ve made a trip to this truck. And I can pretty much foresee all my future trips to Austin with a stop at this place. Brought the boyfriend from SF  who has had his fair share of endless tacos in every neighborhood  and even he can t stop talking about the migas. The drinks too  The Berry Good smoothie is so fresh.  Service  Friendly  They ll let you know the wait time before you order so you can see if you want to stay. STAY.  Ambiance  Outdoors with picnic tables and huge straw umbrellas. Cute place  The wait is no joke for just some tacos though. Like others have mentioned  it can range from 15 to 30 mins. On a Saturday  brunch time  the wait is about 35-40 mins for 3 tacos... which is a little sad considering we devoured the tacos in five mins... But yes  when you order  definitely get 2 tacos for each person  That way you can try more  and leave feeling full minorly stuffed. We had plans to eat elsewhere very soon afterwards so we only ordered 3.  Go   Go  
Veracruz All Natural,299,My favorite breakfast taco spot in Austin  I always get the el tradicional which includes egg  cheese  bacon  refried beans and potato. The sizes are pretty big...Two tacos get me full    I also recommend the green salsa and a horchata to keep you cool from the spice 
Veracruz All Natural,300,Lives up to the hype. The migas breakfast tacos are the real deal  so much so they d make Guy Fieri blush. Big fan of their salsas and chips as well  always fresh  hot  and perfectly crispy. Never had a bad item here  and if you go to their location at Radio  nice patio while you wait for the food  does take a minute  but can t rush perfection  and you can grab a beer or coffee from the lovely coffee shop. A   10 10  bravo 
Veracruz All Natural,301,Fantastic migas and breakfast tacos. I really wanted to come back on my last day in Austin  but alas  it was closed due to  severe weather   come on guys  don t be such wimps .  The 32oz watermelon aqua frescas were also awesome  not sure if you can request less ice... .
Veracruz All Natural,302,One of my favorite taco spots in Austin. Their migas are the best in Austin by far and they make their own tortillas. Amazing x 1000  Love their natural juices  horchata   are a must too. They don t have queso but I love their guacamole 
Veracruz All Natural,303,Always hits the spot and brightens my day. Fresh ingredients  great service  sometimes there s a wait but good things are worth waiting for.
Veracruz All Natural,304,Got the Migas Originales  Poblanas  La Reyna  and did the Chorizo w eggs for breakfast. Nothing memorable. Had the La Bomba juice and La Ley smoothie too. The drinks were the saving grace. Did not see what the hype was - would not last in LA.   Pulled up to the parking lot and knew this wasn t it because of all the patrons being gueros. Hipster gringo approved.
Veracruz All Natural,305,Probably the best tacos I ve ever had. The mole tacos are so good. Sometimes they re all sold out but when they have them  they re super good.
Veracruz All Natural,306,Best tacos I ve ever had. 40 min wait was worth it.  Migas   MUST get. Single best taco in the universe. Add some of the yellow-ish pepper sauce on top and you re good to go.   Fish taco   Also SO SO good. I wasn t in the mood for it  but I got it anyway bc the reviews said it was one of the best. I have to agree with that. Fish was cooked just perfectly. Chipotle sauce and a squeeze of lime added some nice extra flavor.  Chips and Guacamole   Chips were thick and amazing. Guac was good  but nothing super special. Perfect snack to keep my belly happy until tacos were ready.  Tried a bite of my parents  Al Pastor and Fajita Steak tacos and I wish I had gotten the Steak  only bc I was more in the mood for that vs fish . Meat was so tender  with great flavor.  See you again when I m back in Austin  Veracruz Tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,307,Best tacos ever   Beware  this place always has a line and it can sometimes be hard to find a place to sit. But the tacos are so worth it  Everything I have tried here has been amazing. I took my brother here when he visited town and he was super impressed as well.  Their meat is tender and the flavors go together so nicely and beautifully. And it doesn t make you feel gross afterwards - everything is fresh and delicious. I don t think I ve had a better taco in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,308,You gotta try the Migas tacos  It says Migas is one of the top 5 tacos in America and I really think it s that good   I usually don t crave breakfast tacos much  but this is exception. Tortilla chips and pico de gallo add so much flavor to this taco   There could be 10-30 mins wait depends on the time you go but I don t mind. I went in at 8 am on Saturday and there was no line. When I went on Saturday noon  there was bout 30 min wait total. It s still cheaper and faster than going to the restaurant and satisfy me enough   
Veracruz All Natural,309,Got here on a Sunday at noon and the line was 12 deep. Line moves fairly quickly. If you can t find parking  which you probably cant in the lot  there is parking on the street to the left of the gas station.  The migas is definitely the show stopper here. It is loaded with a bunch of goodness. I love the tortilla strips inside that give it that crunch. Portion size is pretty big in my opinion. 5  5  Another good taco was the fish taco  The wife loved it more than the migas. 4.5  5  Fajita taco 4  5  Al Pastor taco - Was not flavorful. Tasted bland. 2.5  5   Chips and salsa was good. Chips are thick crunchy and homemade. The salsa was really good. You can get more salsa at the condiment station where you pick up your food.  Mango Aqua Fresca was a let down. It tasted like water  except it was an orange yellow color. Not sweet at all  They claim they use real fruits  well if they do  they need to taste the fruit to make sure it s sweet or in season. Waste of  4   The Berry Good smoothie was really good though  I d order that again or try another smoothie.
Veracruz All Natural,310,Looongggg wait.   First  stood in line about 15 minutes.   After ordering  it was another good 25 to 30 minutes before our food was ready. I m glad we had ordered the chips and salsa  because they give those to you first  so we munched on them while we waited.  This location is outdoors with limited seating  so either be prepared to Harper and wait for a table  or eat in your car.    The food itself is great. The Miga was voted top five taco in the US by Food Network.  It s a breakfast taco with egg  tortilla chips  avocado  pico de gallo  and Monterey Jack cheese. I thought this was the best taco  though they were all great.  Taco al pastor-flavorful marinated pork  enough marinade that you might not need any of the extra sauces.  Agua Fresca- this is essentially free juice. We got the mango. It looks like the watermelon was also very popular.  Fish tacos-Four of us got fish tacos  and we all thought the Pork al pastor tacos were better.  Steak taco and steak quesadilla-both were good.    I m tempted to take away one star because of the long wait  but really  this place is five stars.
Veracruz All Natural,311,OMG  could there be tastier tacos  The breakfast tacos here are to die for. The most tender egg  yes  I never thought egg could taste different  but it can. The most velvety  tender eggs and soft tortillas danced in my mouth as I enjoyed my breakfast taco dipped in their homemade sauces. I also got the al pastor  which was good mmmm...tender pork  juicy pineapple and a slice of creamy avocado. I m salivating just writing this review. I brought a few friends from out of town who tried the chicken and steak tacos and a torta. Both said their choices were spectacular and there were definitely no leftovers from any of us. We finished our meals  off with a big glass of aqua fresca. Very refreshing on a hot summer day.  My only piece of advice  do not go in the 100 degree afternoon heat. It is by a little gas station and outdoors so if you are not going to take it to go  it will be miserable eating your delicious tacos outside. I cannot wait to go back as the weather cools down.
Veracruz All Natural,312,This place is amazing. The best tacos I ve had in Austin.   We tried the Agua Fresca - mango flavor  ask for less sugar.   The guacamole - very nice freshly fried chips. Suggest mixing in the red hot sauce to make it a bit spicier.   The Migas breakfast taco with chorizo added. Nicely prepared and the tacos are large. They suggested 2. But I was fine with just one.   Ample outdoor seating  but I m sure it s very busy in the summer. They also have  radio playing Latin music which is a nice touch.   Lastly be mindful of the birds   They are someone s meal while they were getting napkins. They also tried quite a few containers of hot sauce   Which was funny but probably unsanitary.   Definitely worth the excursion from downtown 
Veracruz All Natural,313,Went to the food truck on a Sunday for breakfast tacos at the Mueller location. I got the Migas taco and the El Traditional taco. The man at the register was very helpful in helping me decide which tacos to get so I appreciated that. I LOVED the migas taco. The eggs were not dry at all  it was super flavorful  and just an overall good  yet non-greasy  breakfast taco. I didn t love the El traditional taco for a couple reasons  1. the flavor of the bacon overpowered the entire taco  2. the refried beans were part mushed and part whole and I wish they all would have been mushed. We waited about 18 minutes for our tacos which was expected given the fact that it was Sunday and the farmers market was right next door.  I wish they would continue online ordering on the weekends   
Veracruz All Natural,314,Really great tacos  Went for breakfast and beat the crowds by getting here a little bit before 10 on a Saturday. We got the migos poblanos breakfast tacos  chorizo potato egg  chicken mole tacos  and an all pastor  all on corn tortillas and they were amazing. So filling  amazing sauces  and quick service. Also got chips and guacamole  amp  a la bomba juice which were very good  Definitely a good place to stop on your visit to Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,315,Hard to believe I ve been in Austin this long and finally got around to trying Veracruz. Heard so many great things  so today the wife and I took the trek out to East Austin to come grab some tacos. They re really fast about making the tacos and having them out but its clearly freshly made.  We tried the fish taco  an al pastor  and two migas tacos with a watermelon agua fresca. Gotta say these are really good. The migas particularly you can tell they make it with a lot of pride - freshly fried tortilla strips make a world of difference in the tacos. The egg and avocado play backseat to that in a nice textural medley. Add some of their smoky salsa and you re good to go. Hard to believe something that good could be vegetarian.  The fish taco is also pretty good - rare to have a non-fried fish taco  but it tastes clean  not too salty with the cabbage providing the crunch. The al pastor comes topped with avocado too - not used to that  but it has definite smoky notes. I wish there was a bit more charring on the al pastor though - it tastes more strongly of braised pork shoulder than it does with the crispy edgy bits that I ve come to love on it.  Agua fresca comes in a big gulp type cup and it s fresh as can be. Not too sweet and about as refreshing as it gets especially as Austin approaches summer.  That said  great as these tacos are  contrary to what some other reviews say  they re not actually all that big. Not the cheapest lunch if you need 3 to fill you up but once and a while  I d be happy to pay that for lunch.
Veracruz All Natural,316,Not a fan of tacos  especially street tacos.. I just don t understand eating meat and onions wrapped in a tortilla.. but  this place has changed my opinion about tacos in general  LOVED IT. Veggies were cooked perfectly  their sauce was amazing  chicken was very yummy too. Vegetarian options are available  They were able to adjust the proportions of ingredients in my smoothie to my liking as well  without giving me a side eye for being a  complicated  customer . Easy parking and cute wooden tables to sit at. Definitely one of my go to spots in Austin now  
Veracruz All Natural,317,The Perfect migas was well worth the absurd wait  there was a small line  too .  Migas  CORN   3.50  Subtotal  3.50 Sales Tax  8.25    0.29  Total  3.79
Veracruz All Natural,318,I finally made it to Veracruz All Natural. My verdict - the migas TOTALLY deserve all the hype. Tied for  1 for me amongst Austin migas. What makes these migas so good are the house made corn tortillas - both the chewy crisp chips cooked in with the eggs and other ingredients and the fresh tortilla wrapped around the hot  tasty ingredients.  As an aside  these migas share a trait with my other favorites at Cocina de Consuela. Both cook the chips to just the right consistency  kind of al dente  like you d find in chilaquiles  which are a close cousin of migas . Of course  it also helps that the tacos are freshly cooked to order  a fundamental to any good taco.  Like any good migas  these don t really need salsa because the salsa s all included inside - jalapenos  tomatoes  onions and cilantro. Nevertheless  I had to try all 3 salsas and they were good. For you Taco Deli fans  Veracruz s green salsa is basically the same as La Dona. My wife concurred on the excellence of the migas. I also had a taco al pastor. It was good  but nothing out of the ordinary  especially in the shadow of the migas.  At  3 each  the migas tacos are almost free  Next time  I ll get two for sure  maybe even 3. There was a bit of a line when we arrived about 9 45 and it grew steadily while we waited and ate. I m sure it only gets longer as the morning goes on but it s totally worth it. Veracruz is about 20 minutes from my house but it s definitely going to be a regular destination from now on.
Veracruz All Natural,319,Best breakfast tacos  Ever. And the smoothie I got was also amazing. Ok Go. Stop reading this review and just check it out yourself. And maybe take a walk back to downtown Austin as you will likely eat too much.
Veracruz All Natural,320,Even on a cold December morning  it s worth waiting for a meal at this centrally located taco truck. Veracruz usually has a line but it was short today  and food comes out fast once you ve ordered. They take cards and there s a little seating area outside the truck  We decided to try the famous Migas taco  breakfast tacos  and el pastor taco. They re all cheap and additional toppings cost 50 cents. Everything was good  but I felt the breakfast taco with egg  cheese  potatoes and bacon was the best. Of the hundreds of breakfast taco varieties here  this setup is my favorite. They also offer fresh made fruit drinks which would certainly hit the spot in the summer.
Veracruz All Natural,321,pulled an all-nighter to go early. I tried their famous migas breakfast tacos and they re famous for a reason  Everything was delicious and hot- definitely worth the lack of sleep. Some people say it s a bit pricey but it s definitely worth the price and they re very stuffed. Only downside is that they close early   
Veracruz All Natural,322,Talk about a high class taco truck - it s equipped with its own buzzer system  On top of being at the top of its game when it comes to logistics  the tacos are near perfect  and the flavors are elevated to an  out of this world  category when it comes to its house made roasted green chili salsa w chunks of avocado. If only they provided larger cups... the scooping of the sauce into the tiny cups can be be cumbersome but ohh soo worth it   Get the migas  al pastor  chicken mole and any combo of breakfast taco - you won t be let down - and make sure to try the different sauces. We weren t asked whether we wanted flour or corn tortillas  instead all of our tacos came on flour which is the default vessel of choice. If you have a preference  make sure to speak up.  NOTE  Given the size of the  kitchen   it takes a good 20-30 minutes before you receive your order if you happen to go  during the major meal times. Just like any other sit down restaurant  the buzz will ring  and you should proceed to the window on the right side of the motor home  to pick up your order. If you order a fresca  those will will be called out of the window to the left of the ordering window whenever they are ready. The drinks are huge and  4  they ll surely quench your thirst after consuming multiple tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,323,In need of tacos after a long night of drinking and in need of some hangover grub  In need of a quintessential Austin food truck experience  In need of a semi-quick breakfast but still up there in quality  This place has you covered. Delicious  fresh tacos with seating outside for you to enjoy. It is definitely an Austin favorite  for seldom you come here without there being a line. But the wait goes by quickly and is well worth it.   Came here with friends for an Austin food trip and it did not disappoint. Will come back again.
Veracruz All Natural,324,My very fav taco place. I crave these. They got tha recipe game down   Super covid informed services. I m a regular and it s fantastic every time. I just wish they d bring their regular salsa back online.  5 Star  Best vegetarian tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,325,Really freakin good. There was a 20 minute line on a Friday during lunch hour. We got several tacos but the best was the steak fajita. 3.75 5. Great seasoning and fresh. Skip the chips and get an extra taco. The mole one is fun but intense and rich. The fish one was not that great. The tilapia had an intense seafood taste that I always think of being associAted with thawed seafood that s been sitting in that liquid for a bit. Sure it wasn t spoiled or anything just not 100  fresh. They have some seating that can get limited but turnover on the tables is quick. Also some seating in the back near the bbq food truck. Afterwards walk a couple blocks down and catch the lady bird loop trail to burn off some of what you ate. Or do the total opposite and walk a couple blocks in the opposite direction and grad some brews at Zilker brewery
Veracruz All Natural,326,Legit breakfast tacos aka Migas. Queue was long and also slow but what do you expect for a food truck. Can t say it was worth the wait considering I m from the capital  SD  of monster breakfast burritos but it was a nice experience. The service was great and the people working the window were cool AF and accommodating to the patrons with questions. If you don t mind waiting Veracruz is legit.
Veracruz All Natural,327,This place has some of the best tacos that I ve ever had.  I m a California native  spending many years in the Central Valley and in Southern California.  So I good Mexican food.  These tacos...are actually pretty damn amazing.  My friend from Austin recommended that I try this place during my visit and I m so happy I did.  I ll be back 
Veracruz All Natural,328,They use QR code to see the menu and only allow online orders. The food is really good and the outside patio is great. I also ordered a Pineapple Agua Fresca  and it was amazing. The only downside was waiting 15 minutes for my Agua to come out after I got my food. Luckily I had water.
Veracruz All Natural,329,Hands down the best breakfast tacos  the Migas and the poblanos migas are my favorite. Right now with Covid you can place your order online and then just pick it up and eat on the picnic tables. The guacamole was just average but everything else was delicious.
Veracruz All Natural,330,Tried two of the Migas Originales for breakfast and found them to be highly mediocre. There wasn t enough egg or protein  and they weren t very savory. This was all after a 20 minute line and subsequent 35 minute wait. I m also convinced this meal was also responsible for significant digestive issues the next day. The only bright side was the chips  amp  guac. I wouldn t return.
Veracruz All Natural,331,Another food truck with its own little garden in the Austin area  The sign touts its migas taco as being one of the top 5 tacos in the US  so naturally the place can get kind of busy. We arrived around 9 45 for breakfast  and just missed a long line.  In addition to tacos   3  they also do fresh juices and smoothies   4-6   which are really great value as they are huge.  Taco wise  I had the migas  fish and pork.  Migas - I can legit see why this is one of the top 5 in America. I ve no idea how they get so much flavour into the egg  which is the main player in the dish   but they manage it. Seriously delicious  flavorful  and also pretty hefty in its own right  2 of these could easily fill you.  Fish - this is made with tilapia  and is definitely one of the better fish tacos I ve had in my life. Great texture and crispy  with a good zesty flavor. Not as good as the migas  but a great taco.  Pork - slightly disappointed  given that I m a lover of all things pig. Not that it was a bad taco  more that the migas was so good  and I expected my love of all things pig to compound that even further. For me it was lacking slightly in flavor and just didn t have that punch I was expecting.  Overall  great little value spot. Good selection of tacos and really tasty fresh juices - If you re serious about tacos  honestly I d go for the migas - although the other fillings are worth a try.
Veracruz All Natural,332,Finally finally finally made it Veracruz  I ve heard the buzz about this place and have been wanting to try it out since moving to Austin. Every time I ve driven by on the way to work the line has been so long and I d read reviews that mentioned 45 minute wait times  Not going to lie  this dissuaded me a bit. Were these tacos really worth waiting for 45 minutes in the Texas summer heat  In my experience yes  but also no..  I convinced my coworker to make the walk to Veracruz hoping that I didn t just make her walk ten minutes to stand in line and then wait. But  when we got there we were able to walk right up and order. We were told that our wait time was about half an hour  but it ended up being just over 10 minutes. I ordered the migas and the al pastor. From what I d heard the migas was what they were so famous for and al pastor is a go to for me. I honestly have never understood the notion of putting tortilla chips on a taco but wow that migas was amazing  And the al pastor was one of the best I ve had  And I feel like I can say this confidently since I order it every time it s available   I ll definitely be back to try more of their tacos and maybe a smoothie as well  However  I ve got to be honest  if it looks like an hour wait in the sun  I d probably keep driving..
Veracruz All Natural,333,Fajita tacos  amp  Al Pastor tacos were on our plates today and gone in a flash  You will not be disappointed. We wanted the salsa but they were out today. Perhaps next time we will try it. We hope you enjoy it as much as we did 
Veracruz All Natural,334,I was visiting Austin with a friend and since we were staying in the neighborhood  we stopped by Veracruz to grab some breakfast the first morning we were in town.  I was a little hesitant as we were walking up.  I had never gotten a taco out of a school bus before  but there was a crowd and line so obviously there was a reason.  I got a super basic breakfast taco.  Literally just eggs and potatoes in a flour tortilla.  Place my order  grabbed a seat and waited to have our number called.  We got a little packet wrapped in foil and it was a decent size. I hungrily dug in and my eyes lit up.  The tortilla had so much flavor and was warm and delicious.  The potatoes were soft but seasoned nicely  and the eggs were very obviously cooked to order.  I loved every bite and had to to back the next morning to get another one.  By far the best  5 I spent the entire trip.  Yes  that is  2.50 per taco.  Run  don t walk.
Veracruz All Natural,335,My favorite taco spot while visiting Austin. I m so glad I made this place a priority and you should too  I ordered the Migas and La Reyna and the flavor and freshness from the natural ingredients delivered in every bite. I didn t even stop to take a photo because I didn t want to stop eating. Don t forget to add the salsa from the coolers   If you can  beat the lines by coming on a weekday.
Veracruz All Natural,336,When in Austin  you have to get breakfast tacos  This food trailer was amazing  This was our last bite in Austin before we went to the airport  and it definitely did not disappoint.   The food trailer is located in a trailer park with another bbq trailer. They have their own tables for their section. They have a pretty extensive menu of tacos  so there s bound to be something for everyone.   The homemade corn tortillas were delicious  Warm and fluffy and went so well with the taco filling. You can opt for one of their taco creations or you can build your own  either way  it will be delicious  And don t forget to get some homemade agua frescas as well    They have mild and spicy hot sauce that are all made in-house and taste delicious  Get the spicy one as it gives the breakfast tacos a really good kick    Definitely a must try when in Austin 
Veracruz All Natural,337,Yummy tacos for really worth the price   We ordered the breakfast taco  migas taco  fish taco  and steak fajita. I would say you can pass on the steak fajita because it was overcooked. The fish and breakfast was my favorite. For the breakfast taco you can choose two items and we chose chorizo and egg. Yummmm we ll be back for more  
Veracruz All Natural,338,When you wait 35 minutes for some smoothies  the cashier will not be kind or willing to give your money back. This is actually a pool bar  and the bartender is responsible for all the drinks. It is right off the street and seems like a good place to cool down but DO NOT GO HERE if you are thirsty.
Veracruz All Natural,339,Migas is everything. All the food here is great  but the breakfast tacos is where they really shine. And do not miss the amazing salsas.   You can walk right up on a weekday at 1 pm. Saturdays are a completely different story. That aside  this is a must stop breakfast place in Austin and the wait is worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,340,This is actually a review of the Veracruz Food Truck outside of the newly opened Radio on S. Lamar. I am not 100  sure if it is the same truck as the E Cesar Chavez or an additional  but I am guessing the food and offerings are the same.    I had actually heard a lot of good things about the tacos here  especially the tilapia  and when I found out they had mole tacos  I had to try them for myself.  I ordered 3 tacos  their infamous Migas  lived up to the hype   their tilapia fish taco w chipotle sauce and mango salsa  also lived up to the hype   sadly the only taco that was disappointing for me was the chicken mole. The mole was a little on the bland side and a bit pastey  but I am a mole snob  I like my mole with a creamy texture and the perfect balance of spice and chocolate.     The prices are a little pricey for the size of the taco you get  my 3 tacos came to  11.92  however  you can tell they use quality ingredients and everything tasted fresh.    My only other complaint was it took FOREVER for me to get my tacos. I was given a number and went at sat at a nearby bench outside  but literally after almost 20mins I finally had to go up to the trailer and ask what the hold up was. The guy was nice  but seemed to be overwhelmed and acted like my order had either been backlogged or forgotten altogether as right when I was walking back to my bench a couple who had ordered after me were being served their 4 tacos  2 each  respectively   so that was a bit off-putting. But  when I finally did get my tacos almost 30mins later they were hot and tasted freshly prepared.
Veracruz All Natural,341,Please  can someone wrap these tacos up and bring them to NYC    I m originally from California and it s was so easy to get delicious tacos. Now  Deprived of good Mexican food in Manhattan. Veracruz was my first taco stop and I honestly didn t even care for the breakfast tacos. All I wanted was Al Pastor.   The boy and I got the migas taco  al pastor  and an agua fresca. There s just something about these little tacos that is currently making my mouth water even just thinking about them.   The show stopper  The GIANT Agua Fresca that renewed my sense of self. Jk  I don t know what that means but really  it was incredibly delicious. Exactly like the agua fescas I had way back when I travelled to Mexico City.   Highly recommend you stop by 
Veracruz All Natural,342,Veracruz All Natural has some delicious tacos at this truck location. I got the fajita chicken and fajita steak since I had already had eggs that morning and I really do wish I had gotten the migas because I had a bite of my husband s and it was delicious. The tortilla chip inside the taco is genius if you ask me. The chips and salsa were delicious--the chips were crunchy without being greasy and we had a great meal overall. My only complaint is that they need to put some tread on their platform to from their ordering window because it was muddy and a ton of people were slipping. It was really dangerous  Other than that  we had a great experience.
Veracruz All Natural,343,Barbacoa tacos and cantaloupe aqua fresca was amazing  The meat was flavorful and tender  tacos were like two tacos in one.
Veracruz All Natural,344,Breakfast tacos were good. Enjoyed the salsa and chips. Also got some decent quesadillas.
Veracruz All Natural,345,I have not had a breakfast taco prior to this visit and Veracruz has probably ruined the ability for ANY other breakfast taco to compare. I wasn t planning on getting a breakfast taco  but a friendly stranger shared that she was visiting Austin as I was and was making her second trip to Veracruz since she landed the day before. She recommended both breakfast tacos and I ll never forget her. I shared a breakfast taco on corn tortilla  fish taco on corn tortilla  steak taco on corn tortilla  and a watermelon-cucumber drink. It was all incredibly tasty. They all were packed full of flavor that taco trucks do well  but maintained a juicy cleanness about them that most don t. The corn tortilla was perfectly fresh and hot. The size were new to me  but very appreciated as they were on the larger side. I regret not getting more or going more. Highly recommended  everything was good.
Veracruz All Natural,346,Came here with a friend in the afternoon and there was no wait   We got Migas  fish  and chicken mole tacos and I was blown away. The Migas is phenomenal. I ve been waiting to find the best taco in Austin and I know that this is it. The different textures with the tortilla and chips is delicious. Super flavorful.   Bonus  the Skinny smoothie is also super refreshing 
Veracruz All Natural,347,Veracruz is  without a doubt  one of the better tacos in Austin. The al pastor is delicious  breakfast tacos are good too.   Having said that  what really stands out to me as an underrated or underreported bright spot on their menu is their Torta with fajita steak. Wow  Great flavor  super tasty and honestly a better value at 8 bucks for a much larger and filling portion of food than a 3 dollar taco. It s definitely worth a try if you re looking for something new to try from a familiar Austin food truck bus. I highly recommend it.   Another important thing I have to give them credit for. The offerings of salsa are all so good. That s one thing a lot of other places neglect  watery  bland and flavorless. Veracruz salsas are always well seasoned  with varying levels of heat  and they actually enhance and brighten the flavors of the food you put them on.   I gotta ding one star on cleanliness  numerous times I ve visited  the tables eating are can be a little sticky and unkept. Salsa is kept in a small cooler  which I appreciate  but it can get a little messy sometimes as well. Parking can be really rough... not an exaggeration here. Their lot has like 6 spaces and seems to have been the victim of a meteor shower at some point. There are more potholes here than flat ground. Park a block behind and walk around.
Veracruz All Natural,348,Best breakfast taco in Austin  come for the Migas  Call in your order ahead of time to avoid the wait.   Came here during lunch once on a Sunday and was told 25 minutes til my tacos would be ready. I learned for the next time and called ahead - no wait  But tacos are well worth it   
Veracruz All Natural,349,Extremely delicious  I love everything about here  If you go to Austin definitely to have to eat at this place  very clean and they are really fast with the food.
Veracruz All Natural,350,Maybe my favorite taco place in town. Heard it had good ratings but needed to try for myself..literally the best migas taco I ve ever tried  Good value  good guac  good vibes. Freshly squeezed agua Fresca is pretty tasty. Although  seating and lines can be a problem if you get there at the wrong time. If you don t want to wait around  it s right next to kerlins bbq  flat track coffee  and not to far from Juan in a million.   Definitely coming back here soon to get more migas tacos
Veracruz All Natural,351,Only open from 7-3pm  Wished we these in California too   These little foil packets of heavenly goodness were so delicious. I m drooling just thinking about them again.  Migas Poblano Taco- egg poblano chili chips  black beans  red onions  cheese  avocado  Original Migas Taco- eggs  chips cheese  pico   Habanero sauce adds a nice kick where it gets your lip tingling.  Green Sauce adds another layer of flavor to the tacos.  So affordable and fulfilling you can t pass it up.  Dog Friendly. Has a small parking lot.
Veracruz All Natural,352,We came on a Sunday at 10am.. I know I know.. this is optimal breakfast taco truck time and we should ve come earlier  but still.. we waited in line for 1.5 HOURS  It was unseasonably cold when we were there in December  and we were standing there with no protection from the elements.   The tacos are really tasty and they have a few vegetarian options which is great  but I don t think it s worth a 1.5 hour wait.
Veracruz All Natural,353,We came here for breakfast on our first day in Austin and this was a great first experience.  We ordered the cucumber agua fresca  the al pastor and the breakfast taco with egg  cactus  sausage  jack cheese and potatoes. All seating is outdoors  but it is shaded so that was a nice relief from the Austin heat    The cucumber agua fresca was very refreshing  and not too sweet  which we appreciated. The al pastor was delicious  but we didn t like the breakfast taco as much. It could be the toppings I picked  but it was a little too bland.   The price was definitely unbeatable and it is quite amazing that we could have breakfast for two under  10. Overall  we enjoyed Veracruz and our verdict is if we lived close by  we d probably come here every day for breakfast lunch 
Veracruz All Natural,354,The line was long  but worth the wait.  I died over the barbacoa tacos  I know  I know  everyone loves the fish  and I tried that but  man  I loved that pork.  Guac was good. Service was even better. The guy behind the counter was pretty sure he knew my friend and made us laugh.  This place kicks every other tacos ass...  And how do they fit 8 people in that truck making tacos...  
Veracruz All Natural,355,These tacos were incredible   In Austin there are so many taco places that you don t want to waste your time getting an average taco. These tacos were definitely not that- definitely 5 star worthy and worth the wait on a 107 degree summer day.   I got the Migas taco and the chorizo and egg breakfast taco. I had hear how popular the migas taco was so I knew I had to get that. It definitely lived up to expectations but what I was even more wowed by was the chorizo and egg taco. The chorizo was so flavorful  Also  all 3 salsas were delicious. Definitely spicy but that s what I love   My friend ordered the mango aqua Fresca and she always raves about them  Definitely an excellent option for a large refreshing drink on a hot summer day.   I ll definitely be back for more tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,356,My friend and I tried this place for the first time yesterday and it was a bit of a disappointment.  The tacos were super small  comparing them to Torchy s .  The salsa was interesting to say the least  it was runny like they stuck everything in a blender until it was a watery substance.  I will say the ingredients were fresh and the quac was delicious.  You can get twice as much for your   at Torchy s and Torchy s tacos or more flavorful too.  The barbacoa taco had a few pieces of cilantro and a couple of cut up radishes.  No sauces are proved with the taco either unless you pay extra to purchase them.  This place will probably do okay if they only open restaurants a long way from Torchy s.  Personally  I would drive the extra miles to get Torchy s 
Veracruz All Natural,357,Not my favorite. I tried the al pastor tacos and they were just a bit too sweet for me. Hoping to redeem this place I came back to try the migas originales tacos which were far more filling than the al pastor and I only needed one. The side salsas are good as was the service but I probably wouldn t return.
Veracruz All Natural,358,Based on all of the reviews  I came out on a Sunday morning to order their famously-known Migas taco.  As always  the line for a place like this was around the corner into the small parking lot - mostly sunny standing  so if you re sun-sensitive  wear a lot of sunscreen or a hat.  The wait to order is approximately 30 minutes.  The ordering process was very smooth  the menu was quite streamlined - so even if you didn t want the Migas taco  you can still browse and find something you like.  As for the Migas taco itself  it was good  but I wouldn t consider it life-changing or to die for.  I think that it is more novel  the combination of ingredients in a taco   moreso than the flavor.  I have a preference for traditional street tacos  so I found myself liking their steak taco moreso than anything.  Overall  I think that as a stop - it isn t a bad one  but if you re in any kind of rush - take a pass on the place.  If you re here with a group of people who haven t come to Austin before and have time to spare  I think it s a great place to stop by and try - as the ambiance is very chill and great for catching up.  I wouldn t recommend the Migas taco  but I think the other items on the menu are perfectly good.
Veracruz All Natural,359,Currently trying to plan another trip to Austin just so I can get my hands on these tacos     ok I might be a little dramatic but they are seriously so good. I am pretty big on tacos  I love them so much and if you do too then you gotta hit this spot especially for breakfast tacos    My best friend who lives in Austin recommended this place praised it highly as one of the top taco places for quality  price and size. Their tacos are decently sized after 2 of the breakfast tacos and guacamole and chips I was decently full. I got the migas breakfast tacos and added bacon to it and one with sausage both were good  The sausage wasn t the pork sausage I expected  it was close to a hot dog but hey it still tasted good. What made it even more banging was the sauces they have. They had this creamy jalape o sauce that i highly recommend it really adds a medium kick  But the tacos without it were just as good. With the guacamole  it was so creamy and so flavorful i was a huge fan   I ordered the mango Agua Fresca drink which was a really nice cooling drink in the Texas heat especially while you re waiting for your food. It wasn t too sweet and was not as concentrated as regular mango juice. I also tried their steak quesadilla which the steak was really good and juicy and super cheesy  It s nothing too special but still taste great    Warning if you do come at it s peak hours when there s a line it can take a while  Even for the drink but it s worth the wait. I even returned the next da because I just had to take advantage of that place while I was there.
Veracruz All Natural,360,The Short  This place lives up to their name.  Not only do they use quality ingredients  but they re cooked well   Tacos - how good can it possibly be   If you really understand how quality ingredients interact with one another and strategically place them on a tortilla  you ll get a taco from Veracruz All Natural.  This place doesn t do it flashy or fancy  they do it right.  All the tacos are classic and will blast you right into their culture.  From the reviews  I had to try the Migas Taco and the Fish Taco.  Thank you fellow Yelpers  these two tacos were dead on   No one ingredient overpowered the others.  I absolutely love the small tortilla chips in the Migas tacos as they gave it an excellent crunchy texture.  Never before had I truly enjoyed a taco without red white meat until now.  As for the fish taco  the tilapia was flaky and seasoned well  much better than many fish tacos that I ve had before.  As I was eating  I could see eggs and mangoes being wheeled into the cart  no shame to say It was applause-worthy.  I can t wait to come back to try their other tacos.  The wait tends to be long during the rush hour  I had to wait 30 minutes   but the tacos are definitely worth it.  Their Aguas Frescas are worth getting too  super refreshing on a 100 degree day 
Veracruz All Natural,361,The migas taco is the highlight of this taco joint. Go for the migas poblano if you enjoy beans and pepper  and be sure to get a corn tortilla  they re made fresh . The tortillas were flavorful and the toppings plentiful. All things considered  perhaps the best tacos I ve ever had outside of Mexico -- tied with some other spots in this neighborhood.  Don t go expecting a quick bite  though -- at 8 30 on a Friday it took around 25 min to get 4 tacos. If you re not in a rush  though  it s quite relaxing to hang out in the shaded picnic area.  The surprise hit of our two visits to Veracruz were the ultra fresh juices  go for the Good and the Burner and you won t be disappointed.
Veracruz All Natural,362,The Al Pastor was really  really good - the chicken fajita was better than ok to good  but I d get the pastor again  hands down.  The guac was just good  but  5 - not a great value there  I also like mine a bit more flavorful - it seemed to lack lime and salt.  The salsas were nice and hot  and tasty.
Veracruz All Natural,363,Veracruz knows how to make a killer breakfast taco  From the the fresh made  locally sourced four tortillas to the house made salsa and sauces  it s easy to tell everything is made with love  hard work  and impeccable flavor. I got to try the Migas Taco and Migas Poblanos Taco. Both were delicious. The crispy tortilla chips and the fresh slice of avocado in both provided a nice contrast of crunchy and creamy textures. It s hard to pick a favorite  so I would honestly suggest going and trying both   The Migas Poblanos is a little bit hearty due to the black beans  so just be aware of that. I paid about  7.85 for two tacos  which I don t think is too bad considering it was enough food to fill me up for most of the day. Parking is free on site  so go give them a try if you re in the area 
Veracruz All Natural,364,I call myself a novice when it comes to Mexican food  how you ask  That s because I Live in San Diego and we have the best Mexican food in the world. However when you re in a different city and one of the best things to do is try breakfast tacos  you have to give it a try.  We usually would look for a breakfast brunch joint if we decide to eat out in the morning  however we love trying new places.  My wife and I were surprised by the quality of the breakfast tacos. This has to be one of the best breakfast meals in the morning. We ordered three different types of breakfast tacos and all of them tasted fantastic   even my seven-year-old son ate his whole taco. The hot sauces were amazing  this is definitely a spot that y all must visit while in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,365,This really suffers in comparison to Rositas al pastor  where id eaten the day before. The al pastor tacos were amateurish. The fish were a solid four and the small taste of mole I had was decent. The chips and guacamole were REALLY good though.
Veracruz All Natural,366,These tacos were change your life kind of tacos. I still dream of them tacos. A white lighted beacon of hope in the land of crappy flour tortilla Mexican food-land tacos.   Coming off of a bachelorette party in Austin  my only request to my local friend I was staying with was breakfast tacos. Former Californian and half Latina that she is  aka extremely picky about tortilla quality   she took me here.   Affordable. Delicious. The corn tortillas were INSANELY fresh. I got two breakfast tacos  one with potatoes and chorizo and the migas. I dumped both kinds of salsa on it  they are definitely spicy but not too much.   Be warned  the line is long and it does take a while. But they re totally and completely worth it. It made me sad I hadn t ordered more or ordered a burrito - I have dreams about what the al pastor burrito might taste like.
Veracruz All Natural,367,I probably just ate the best tacos I ve had so far in Austin. The ingredients were so fresh. I ordered the vegetarian and the fish taco. They come on flour tortilla and come individually wrapped in foil. I picked up one green salsa to go and boy was it hot. All you need is a couple drops of that to spice up your taco. They also have a large selection of juices and smoothies which seemed very popular. Next time I would like to try that. The only downside is not enough parking spots and the tow truck constantly coming to tow cars away since there are two food trucks sharing the lot with a convenient store and gas station. Definitely will come back to this place but at less busy time.
Veracruz All Natural,368,Best tacos I have ever had in my life  hands down. Didn t know breakfast tacos were a thing  but now that I ve discovered them there s no going back. The la Reyna taco is good  but the al pastor is absolutely fabulous. I highly recommend it  and also to get  the works  so it comes with guac.   I walked from my hotel downtown and it took about half an hour. Passed through some fun and funky areas and I definitely would suggest it.   They have a bunch of picnic tables and a few covers for when it rains. I regret not getting a smoothie too  considering how cheap everything is.
Veracruz All Natural,369,OH MAN OH MAN BLESS ALL THE TACOS FROM THE PLACE  This place is so good  I can t stop thinking about it. Their menu is small  but packed with flavor and a great mexican punch   I ve been here at least five times  and this place never fails to fill up my stomach every time   I always get the Migas  Al Pastor and Steak tacos  and it s the best around  that nobody is ever gonna get you down   The sauces really complement the tacos well  except they re really spicy  So if you have a good spice tolerance  not like me who cries when I eat hot Cheetos   give it a try   I have not had their Aguas Frescas  but I hear that they are the bomb  Go try it tonight 
Veracruz All Natural,370,Love me some Austin tacos  5 stars      I was in Austin for ACL weekend one and had to have me some delicious Austin tacos.   FOOD  I got the breakfast tacos with potato and chorizo  Loved    I ll get this every time if I could      LOCATION  I can t describe this any other way but to say it s SO AUSTIN. There s tons of sitting space and there might be wi-fi because people were out there with their laptops. This place shares sitting area with a coffee shop brewery  surprised  It s comes in clutch when you just wanna order your tacos then head over to the brewery and get yourself a nice cold beer.   SERVICE  It s a food truck... I just ordered it from the guy at the window and that was it 
Veracruz All Natural,371,One of the best breakfast taco joints in Austin. Normally I get BEC tacos but here the play is the migas tacos. Soooo good
Veracruz All Natural,372,This review isn t about the food  but the customer service. I m not one to write reviews or complain but wish I knew this before we went and wasted our afternoon. So wanted to like this place  The reviews were great and I heard good things about the food  We went after kayaking this Sunday and waited for an hour and a half to leave with the guy working handing us a bag of chips and saying  sorry we lost your ticket . AN HOUR and A HALF later. I have worked in the restaurant industry and totally understand this happens but it was so dismissed. The guy honestly seemed he could have cared less that we never got our food after waiting so long. I checked in multiple times on our order and he told me multiple times it was being made and  15 more minutes  about three times until finally I said we needed to leave soon and when it would really be done. Then he found out from the kitchen the ticket got lost  they never got our order and it was actually never made. So  he gave us a bag of chips. It was disappointing this wasn t taken more seriously that we had waited so long to then leave with nothing after spending our afternoon waiting there. Again things totally happen but was handled just so poorly. Really bad customer service the kid working seemed nice but clearly hasn t been trained well on customer service or it should have been brought to a manager earlier when they cancelled our order after almost 2 hours of waiting outside their restaurant.
Veracruz All Natural,373,The steak taco and fish taco are really tasty. Super fresh ingredients and the fish tacos has mangoes in it for an extra kick    The steak was fresh and tasted incredible with the avacados and onions. I also got the chips and guacamole and chips and salsa. The chips were very fresh and didn t taste like regular Tex mex chips. Authentic and def would go again  I went the day after to get the same thing  
Veracruz All Natural,374,Probably ranks among the top 3 tacos I ve ever eaten  and I live in San Diego. Sadly one of the last meals we had while visiting Austin  so we could not eat it again before we left. We will return   If you like chorizo  I recommend ordering the migas tacos with chorizo added 
Veracruz All Natural,375,Awesome migas and la rena tacos   The migas had a combo of migas  tortilla  salsa. The la rena taco has egg  avocado  spinach. Excellent flavor  We had a chance to eat before the rain  limited seating near the food truck. The smoothies were delicious too. The food was definitely worth braving the rain.
Veracruz All Natural,376,Unlike Torchys and Taco deli  the tacos here don t have any crazy names or ingredients. What they do have is fresh ingredients and homemade tortillas. The salsas seemed mild to medium in intensity.  Coming here after a long run  I devoured my barbacoa and migas tacos without even taking the obligatory picture. I can reassure anyone that they are deee-licious though. One thing I want to edit is the number of yelp dollar signs on this business. I think I could eat  15 worth of food here given how tasty the tacos were.
Veracruz All Natural,377,5 stars for me all around. There tacos are incredible I tried almost all of them during my visit. My favorite were the migas breakfast taco and the steak taco. But probably the best aspect about there tacos is the corn tortilla. I highly recommend getting the corn instead of the flour. They have so much flavor and to me there corn tortillas make the whole experience.  Come here for breakfast tacos. Come here for lunch tacos come here for dinner tacos. At Veracruz you will always be satisfied the food is made with quality ingredients  care and love. Please be aware that this can mean a nice long wait depending on when you arrice. Weekends are very busy    Come to Veracruz for all your taco needs
Veracruz All Natural,378,Tacos on corn is a must and these are awesome. Migas are a must in Austin and theirs is the best to be found. I m halfway between their restaurant in the northwest and this one. If it s nice and sunny this one is better. Seating is limited but the pace of the line is enough that there s enough tables to share.
Veracruz All Natural,379,The Migas Originales and the Migas Poblanos are my favorite breakfast tacos in all of Austin. La Reyna is also a fantastic taco packed with healthy veggies. If you haven t been to any of these trucks  then you are missing out on Austin s best taco truck.
Veracruz All Natural,380,Pretty decent tacos with some better than others. The migas taco  which is their claim to fame and featured on  the food network  is a breakfast taco with eggs  cheese  fried tortilla chips and avocado. It s definitely one of those tacos that tastes better as you eat it. And their sauces help a lot  by adding that much needed heat and creaminess.   Their al pastor was tasty but not as good as it looked. It has this bright red sauce all over it but the flavor didn t have as much depth as most a pastor and didn t appear to be slow cooked since the pork still had a bite to it.   Lastly  their Carne taco was just okay. I prefer my carne to be cooked over the grill vs soft and stewed.   The highlight of the meal is the tortilla  it taste so fresh and the consistency and texture was so good. It definitely taste freshly made and fresh tortilla just elevates the taco up a few notches and is probably their saving grace.
Veracruz All Natural,381,OMG  the tacos    I only had the breakfast tacos  but they were awesome  They are so good we went back for lunch   I only had the migas and migas poblanas tacos. The migas were perfect little breakfast tacos. It s kind of like chilaquiles but in taco form. Putting tortilla chips in a taco adds that crunch that elevated the texture of the taco.  The migas poblanas is like the migas but with poblano peppers and black beans. These were great too  but too much stuff in a taco. The filing to taco ratio was off that it was starting to get messy. But the flavors were all on point.  I also ordered one of their berry smoothies  which was nice.  They also have fresh salsas you can add to your tacos. Some mild  the orangey looking one will definitely add a little spice to your taco. All of them really good. If they run out  ask them to replenish.  There s going to be line for these tacos  the length depends on the weather. But you will understand that it is worth it  it was so yummy. Great cheap eats and out of a food truck. I wish they had a truck here on the East Coast 
Veracruz All Natural,382,Some of the best tacos I ve ever had  I wish I lived in Austin so I could get some more often. I used to think that all tacos were about the same  but I changed my mind after coming here.   The tortillas are so important  Veracruz makes their own corn tortillas  which are just sooo much better than normal corn tortillas from other taco places. The corn tortillas here are more tender  less dry and crumbly  and hold the taco together pretty well instead of just falling apart. They actually taste like corn...super delicious. I would definitely recommend getting corn tortillas here  but the flour tortillas are good too   .   The fillings are also generous for the breakfast tacos as well as the street tacos. The bf and I ate 5 tacos between the two of us and we were really stuffed. We tried the migas  fish  chorizo and egg  la reyna  and al pastor tacos. My favorites were the migas and the al pastor. The tortilla strips in the migas taco were still crunchy and added texture to the taco  which I really enjoyed.   The wait was a little long because they make everything to order  but it was worth it. I can t wait to come back again 
Veracruz All Natural,383,I really  really enjoy the food here.  I d give it 5 stars based on that fact alone.    But I have to knock it down a couple of stars for the experience  aka trying to find parking.  I pulled into what you would think is the food truck parking lot  only to get yelled at and berated by the business owner employee in the adjacent lot.  I had no intention in parking in their designated spots but that did not stop him from yelling at me and then staring me down until I left the lot.    At the end of the day  it s not worth the stress to deal with their  get off my lawn  neighbor and there are plenty of other Vera Cruz locations to enjoy their delicious food.
Veracruz All Natural,384,The corn tortillas are amazing since they are made by hand. The guacamole is good and fresh but needs a little lime to add some more flavor in there. The tacos were good. More specifically the fish taco was amazing. The pastor tacos were well seasoned but something about them doesn t seem right like it s missing something. I also got a breakfast taco and that I can say that I would not get again  I know better places for that. Coming from a humble Mexican  I can say this place for the most part is legit even with all the gringos.
Veracruz All Natural,385,The best Taco Truck ever  I was invited there by a friend who was telling me how amazing this place was. I had the Migas Taco and it was great very tasty and good quality I definitely will come back to get more tacos anytime. Place was clean and plenty of space to seat and enjoy your food. This place is always crowded so be prepared to be waiting in line for a little bit to place your order but trust me the wait is worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,386,Destination tacos   Came by here the other morning and was very happy to try it.  I got a couple migas tacos and it was definitely the best migas I ve ever had in Austin.  I even got a bonus potato and bacon taco  which was also delicious  since they made an extra one accidentally and gave it to me for free.    This is now my go-to for tacos and will also be where I bring friends from out of town.
Veracruz All Natural,387,One of my favorite taco places in Austin. Love their breakfast tacos. Everything is so fresh and full of flavor. They also cook the flour tortilla shell slightly which makes it a little crispy  which is a great touch that the other taco places don t do.  Also the aguas frescas are da bomb. You can pick from about 6 different fruit flavors. They are so refreshing on a hot day.  The only downside is the tacos are on the smaller side so will probably need to order more tacos to fill you up.  Can t go wrong at Veracruz All Naturals.
Veracruz All Natural,388,Best breakfast tacos in Austin    Get the Migas poblanos. The orange salsa is super spicy.
Veracruz All Natural,389,Hola amigo  the migas tacos at Veracruz All Natural are nothing short of extraordinary. Upon first bite  I can see why they re consistently at the top of all rankings. Situated in a gravel lot  their converted school bus also churns out amazing agua frescas. The workers are friendly and the food comes out hot and fresh.
Veracruz All Natural,390,There was a lot of hype behind this taco truck but the tacos were just good nothing special. I must say the sandia water was sooo good and the red salsa had the perfect kick to it.  Ps the parking sucks.
Veracruz All Natural,391,Cheap and delicious breakfast tacos. Get a few different types here to try them all. Only negative thing about this place is the birds are addicted to the tacos here too so watch your food carefully 
Veracruz All Natural,392,Amazing  An absolute must do  It was busy on a Sunday at 8am...that should tell you enough. I got the migas and la reyna...so flavorful. I was in love at the first bite  The tortilla was so fresh  soft  and chewy. The avocado and pico de Gallo was fresh  the tortilla chips added great crunch and varied the texture of the dish. The spinach  carrots  mushrooms  bell peppers in la reyna were grilled and charred well...so fresh and delicious. They have sauces on the side for your helping....they are delicious. The extra hot sauce and pico de Gallo is a must 
Veracruz All Natural,393,Really great tacos and great salsa  we got there right around 9 00 on a Sunday  morning and it wasn t bad but it definitely got busy after. Worth the wait 
Veracruz All Natural,394,I love these tacos. Always have to make a stop here whenever I come to Austin. They are definitely worth the wait  Can t wait to go back 
Veracruz All Natural,395,The saying that sketchy places make the best food  holds true for this little place. Its a school bus permanently parked in a dirt lot next to a pinata party place.  You d miss it if you weren t looking for it  and maybe even if you are looking. I passed it my first time by.  All the rave about these migas tacos. I couldn t leave Austin without them.    I went with 2 after the girl s suggestion  if you re hungry get 2 .  They are large and filling  I could have eaten 1 with my coffee and been fine. Although it is a ton of chips  I took a handful out and there was still enough.   The eggs are scrambled with cilantro and maybe some other stuff.  They were tasty on their own.  No dry rubbery stuff.  There were too many chips for my liking but I just took them off.  The salsa was WAY too overpowering vinegar.  Pass the TUMS.  It ruined one taco -good thing I got 2.  The red sauce is hot  but is a nice flavor.  The tortillas are made in house.  I watched these ladies make tortillas at the window as I waited for my tacos.   The tacos were good but I personally would have liked to try it without the chips.  I bet it would have been great still.
Veracruz All Natural,396,Ohhhhh man  this place has the best breakfast tacos that I have ever had. I got both versions of the Migas and wow  Highly recommend  Also  I like that they had picnic tables to sit at. Also  try the salsas  they were all delicious 
Veracruz All Natural,397,Before coming to town  I had heard about this place and made it a must eat for my visit to Austin. So we pulled into town and went straight here for lunch. I wanted to go to the original location  so there we were  in the larking lot  at the school bus  ordering from the window. There was a good amount of seating and the general area was shared with a BBQ truck. The grounds were not kid friendly as there was broken glass everywhere  intentionally . Parking lot was full so we parked a few blocks away. The line fluctuates in length.  Now onto the food. We got a handful of taco  broken down below   Fish - good amount of fish  sauce complemented the meat well Steak - My favorite  Meat was in strips and chewy  flavor was bold Al Pastor - too much marination in my opinion  tortillas on all tacos were amazing  I was surprised they did not have horchata and the salsa bar was pretty basic. We also got a side of chips and guac that was small in size for what you pay. Still a four-star review because the tacos were so good 
Veracruz All Natural,398,Not sure how in the world it took me so long to finally try Veracruz  its been bookmarked for over a year   but I finally did.  I had some friends in town and wanted to get some good breakfast tacos but also wanted to try something new so Verazcruz it was.  We showed up around 11am on a Monday and there were a couple other people sitting at the outdoor tables but no line to order. I ordered the veggie breakfast taco and the migas. Let me start by saying there is rarely a meal that I get with out some type of meat and leave feeling full but that has not been proven all wrong.  Both tacos were extremely hot  as in to touch  and also massive.  Two tacos was the perfect amount of food  although I could have probably ate more.  The veggie taco had so much flavor in there that you would think it wasn t even real. Not much to say about the migas taco that hasn t been said already  its incredible.  I WILL BE BACK   Many more times.
Veracruz All Natural,399,Waited in line for about 30 minutes for the food. Got a migas taco  fish taco  chicken mole  and al pasto. The fish taco was really delicious and I also liked the migas but the other two were underwhelming. Definetly try the fish taco.
Veracruz All Natural,400,This place is AMZING     The breakfast tacos were orgasmic  the sauce soooooo delicious  the mango juice bomb dignity. Definitely recommend this spot
Veracruz All Natural,401,Came in here with high expectations but I think the service ruined the food for me...literally.   I ordered the famous Migas Taco  named one of the top 5 best tacos in America by Food Network  and the Fish Taco  named a minimal masterpiece by Rolling Stone magazine.  Food took forever and tons of people who came after were served before me so I don t know what made my order take so long. When I did get it  it took so long  I had to switch my order to to go. They gave me a tiny paper bag. Not sure why because other people had bigger bags. Then the bag started to leak so I had to get a plastic bag and clean it up. The sauce that leaked  I now see  reading these reviews  was the famous spicy sauce for the Migas Taco. It was incorrectly sealed and placed in the bag by them  not me. By the time I caught it  all of it was gone. The lack of this sauce  when I ate it  might explain why I didn t think it was AMAZING. Good but not amazing. The fish taco was better  in my opinion. Juicier and heartier.   Maybe the Migas sauce would have made a difference but since I didn t know and it spilled everywhere  I ll never know.
Veracruz All Natural,402,I probably eat Vera Cruz tacos 10 too 15 times a month. The food here is so delicious  especially the fish tacos  It s always fresh. And unlike other places   they give you so much food 
Veracruz All Natural,403,I was visiting Austin with my sister and we had to stop by at the Vera Cruz food truck   We were super excited and knew it was going to be good seeing how long the line was and how many people were there. I got a steak taco and a fish taco. I would have to say the steak was very soft and melts in your mouth  However  it was kind of bland to me. The fish taco on the other hand was amazing    The mango salsa that was on there with the cabbage  lime  and red sauce was DE-LISH  I will be dreaming about that taco... great place  Friendly staff  they were pretty fast  and everyone seemed happy to be there too 
Veracruz All Natural,404,Someone needs to sit down with me and explain why breakfast tacos are not a thing in the Bay Area. Breakfast burritos are delicious  alright  but they also make you want to take a nap after instead of beginning your day. Correct me if I am wrong  but isn t the point of eating breakfast to fuel us and give us energy to start the day  Breakfast burritos seem to contradict this logic since I always feel like I do not want to move an inch after finishing one  you can say I could opt not to finish a burrito  but burritos are delicious. Why stop eating    Now that the rant is over  Veracruz is one of the places where we tried breakfast tacos. I read that the line can get very long  but we were lucky as there was only one other guy ahead of us in line when we arrived. Score  The service was incredibly friendly and patient as we narrowed down our choices from everything in the menu to just four.  We ordered the chicken mole  chorizo  migas  and a concoction of bacon  avocado and cactus. Our order took about ten minutes to be ready because they cook to order. But the wait was worth it. All were so incredibly delicious. It was evident that the tortillas and the ingredients were fresh. And my most favorite part  They were just the right size  They gave me enough energy to carry me through the busy day and I did not even feel a drop of sleepiness.   I really wish we had Veracruz in my neighborhood. I am now a big fan of breakfast tacos and they make really good ones 
Veracruz All Natural,405,Well worth the wait if you are a fan of migas tacos  I love eggs and I love tacos so the combination just works perfectly especially the way that they prepare this dish. I do love mole and I was expecting to be blown away by it but it was no up to par to other restaurants I have had mole at. If you want mole  go to Habanero. If you want migas tacos and delicious agua fresca  go to Veracruz   
Veracruz All Natural,406,This review is solely based upon the breakfast tacos  so if you want to know more about anything else they serve  skip my review.    I had the Migas Poblana taco  as well as a basic egg and bean taco  both on corn tortillas.  Pros   Fresh made corn tortillas  Not every spot does that - important  Yum   Lots of tables - all covered with umbrellas or under a canopy - nice place to eat outside if you don t sit close to the street   Very good salsas  Tasted very fresh   Tacos served nice and hot   Parking was easy  They recycle   Tasted fairly healthy - not heavy at all    Beans are made with canola oil instead of lard or pork fat  so no need to worry about this if you or your dining companions are vegetarian  Cons  -Sigh - their beans are  well  just OK  -  this keeps me from wanting to come back for breakfast tacos for sure -Takes a while to get your tacos  that is not unique to this food truck bus  so it s almost a moot point  but you should plan for this when making time to come here -Lacked that special something-something flavor texture that makes me crave coming back for another round tomorrow  like some other places are able to do. There are just too many breakfast taco options out there to settle for less than phenomenal tacos  I guess I have a very high bar for tacos   Overall impression  I ll come back for lunch 
Veracruz All Natural,407,Excellent and definitely worth the wait. The migas was probably my favorite migas breakfast taco I ve had  and I ve had a couple. Just the mix of fried tortilla and egg and peppers was really good  and the tortilla really kept it s crunch. Also the fish taco was fantastic. Maybe one of the best fish tacos I ve ever had  and I ve had even more of those than migas tacos. I d happily go back and try other things  but more likely I d just get more fish and migas.
Veracruz All Natural,408,What looks to be your typical food truck tacos turned out to be some of the best food we had on our whole trip to Austin - and that seems to be the general consensus with Veracruz. From the selection of breakfast tacos to your more standard fare  the menu checks all boxes. I can t even say a favorite because they were all equally delicious and far superior to what we have in Chicago  getting depressed just writing this . My only complaint about this place are the long lines that form relatively quickly each day - choose your time carefully or be ready to wait a little bit before chowing down. Trust me  it s worth the wait 
Veracruz All Natural,409,Bien Bien Bien     Choo choo  I m all aboard the breakfast taco train. I grew up i the southwest and I was indoctrinated to the breakfast burrito from day one. I didn t know the glorious invention of breakfast tacos existed until I visited Austin. Thankfully for us  we stayed right by the best b-fast taco joint in town   I honestly don t know where to begin -  the migas  migas poblanos  la reyna  and adding freaking cactus to my taco    Thankfully there were no thorns in this cactus  but it sure did  spike  my appetite. The migas was probably my favorite and it coincidentally is their most popular taco.   An underrated menu item here is the agua fresca...POW...that s the feeling when it hit my tastebuds. Fresh fruit blended together to create a cool  sweet  and refreshing feeling as you enjoy amazing breakfast tacos.  Pro Tip - Veracruz is very dog friendly and has a good amount of patio seating. Put on some sun screen and bring your pup 
Veracruz All Natural,410,Holy cow man. This has to be one of the best taco places on Earth  Had the migas and the fish taco and they were both out of this world. Migas is so full of flavor just makes you want to have more. Fish taco has a bit of a kick to it which isn t that bad but adds something to take it up a notch. If you re ever in Austin come here. Definitely recommend   
Veracruz All Natural,411,We haven t had the food  we stopped by for some aguas frescas and they didn t fail us. They were delicious. Very refreshing  not overly sweet. Just perfect    Will definitely come back to eat
Veracruz All Natural,412,I m pretty snobby when it comes to tacos after living in Austin for years  but this place continuously blows me away every time I have the privilege to eat their food. The Migas Originales is  dare I say  the best breakfast taco you ll find in Austin. I usually get it on corn because this place makes a fantastic corn tortilla that won t fall apart and will taste incredible. Their other tacos are very good  and I really enjoy the Tacos Al Carbon as well. Their guacamole is unreal  and don t sleep on the sauces for your tacos that they have tucked away in the corner. If you re really feeling adventurous  try a freshly made Agua Fresca which is equally on par to the rest of the menu items. Overall  I wish I could give this place 6 5 stars. If you haven t given this place a visit  do yourself a favor and go. Even if there s a line  it s for a good reason.
Veracruz All Natural,413,When visiting Austin  top of multiple to do lists was getting breakfast tacos. A quick Eater search led me to Veracruz which was a short walk from my hotel.  Short  as in 15 minutes in the Texas heat. The food truck had to be hotter because there was a line about 12 people Deep and packed seating on the picnic tables. I ordered two tacos from the choices--potatoes  eggs  and cheese on both with ham on one and bacon on the other. The potatoes we soft and flavorful. The Cheese was gooey and the eggs fluffy. Pair that with the spicy salsa on the side and I was in heaven. I thought to order the Watermelon Kiwi juice but almost forgot the water. Don t forget the water 
Veracruz All Natural,414,I had a lottttttt of tacos while on vacation in Austin and these were the BEST. They beat Torchy s Tacos for me and I thought Torchy s was amazing too  We each ordered the famous Migas taco  Al Pastor and the fish taco with chips and guac and the freshly squeezed watermelon juice. This juice was so delicious that I was craving more even after finishing the huge cup they give it to you in  theres only one size  . These tacos were honestly life changing and I haven t eaten tacos since I ve gotten back to New York because I know it won t be the same. I can t even pick a favorite because they were all equally so beyond delicious. I wish I went one more time while I was in Austin. If you re in the area  do yourself a huge favor and go get yourself some tacos from Veracruz 
Veracruz All Natural,415,This place is amazing  I love the breakfast tacos  I love the chicken tacos  I will be going back again and again
Veracruz All Natural,416,Sadly  this will be my last time eating here. The tacos are pretty darn good  amp  clean-ish as far as eating out goes  they do use canola oil  amp  no -organic . I wish they would take food intolerances more seriously  I was served flour tortillas after Indicating a gluten intolerance. I also witnessed an employee using a bare hand to dip a chip into the large container of guacamole that is used to serve all others from and then chow down behind the register. From a sanitation stand point this is concerning. This was my third experience and every time my order has had an issue. Every time the ticket has been correct  items have just been made incorrectly or forgotten all together.
Veracruz All Natural,417,There will certainly be a line if its close to lunch time or a weekend BUT its worth it. Try the Al Pastor tacos  migas tacos  or any one of your favorite flavors of  huge  Agua Fresca.
Veracruz All Natural,418,MUST GO HERE. The Migas breakfast tacos are incredible  and filling . I ordered one of those   a breakfast taco with egg  potato and chorizo  super delicious. I recommend the flour tortillas as they are thicker and sturdier than the corn  and keep everything together.  You definitely should try the agua fresca. Never had one as flavorful as this. Not watered down  just straight fruit. Between my friend and I  we had the cantaloupe   strawberry  my favorite   mango  and watermelon. All were delicious  and we went back multiple days. Great for a hot day.  The line can get long quickly  but always found table space to wait under an umbrella. It s worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,419,Solid spot for tacos and juice. Line was pretty short on a Sunday afternoon. Tried the fish  al pastor and migas taco. I quite liked the fish  very tender  although my mom noted that it was very fishy in taste. Al pastor came nicely spiced and meat was very tender. The migas taco was an interesting surprise - I liked the crunch that the chips added to the dish.   The aqua frescas were also amazing. Watermelon juice was refreshing and pineapple was very yummy as well.
Veracruz All Natural,420,Eating the Migas tacos is an existential experience. Like how did life exist prior to knowing the deliciousness of the Migas taco. Ranked top 5 breakfast tacos in the USA and for good reason. Go here. Just do it.
Veracruz All Natural,421,Solid and quick tacos for the price. We got 5 options - fajita steak  fajita chicken  al pastor  fish  and a black bean with bacon and cheese breakfast taco with drinks  and still kept it under  20. Each taco was a nice size with a yummy tortilla keeping it all together. The meat in the pastor and steak was cooked well  not too dry and definitely a lot of flavor. The only one I wouldn t get again was the fajita chicken - the chicken was cut a little too think and chunky for me  but nothing to get too worked up over. They also have a nice selection of salsas - nice big chunks of avocado in the mild one  which I was a big fan of
Veracruz All Natural,422,After reading Yelp reviews  and noticing Veracruz was mentioned by Food Network as one of the nation s top 5 tacos  I was intrigued. I came here on a weekday around lunch with my boyfriend. There was not a long wait at all  but plenty of people coming in and out.   During lunchtime  they were still offering breakfast tacos  and since Yelp raved about the  Migas  taco  naturally  we ordered two. We also had the al pastor and the carne taco  with an order of watermelon agua fresca.   The ingredients in the Migas were simple  but fresh and worked perfectly together. The tortilla chip crunch with the soft handmade corn tortilla was an excellent and delicious play on texture. Overall  a solid taco that I would get again. 5 5.  Both of us agreed the carne taco was better than the al pastor. The beef was great.   Don t forget to try the three sauces salsas. The two sauces are both pretty spicy  but I don t like spicy  so try it anyway bc they re still great   and the salsa has real and big chunks of avocado in it. WOW. This was all included at the area near taco pick-up window.  Overall  MIGAS taco is a must here  and the agua fresca watermelon was HUGE and worth the   to wash down the delicious  homemade lunch we enjoyed here.
Veracruz All Natural,423,We found this gem while in Austin  and I kid you not  we went twice in one weekend. They are that good. I m Mexican by birth so I hold a high standard for tortillas. To me  they are the base of a taco an thus an important part. Veracruz tortillas are excellent. No two ways about it  if you arrive mid morning  you will stand in line and your tacos will take a while. Well worth it  and I don t wait for much. Just come prepared to wait but to know that the Migas taco  the fajita taco and the mole taco are well worth the wait. The mole taco is not something I would order regularly but this one was delicious  Don t skip it  if you are a mole person like me.
Veracruz All Natural,424,The food is really great. The service was really really slow  especially compared to other places we went to that day. The drinks options were plentiful and very much needed on a hot day. Definitely would go back 
Veracruz All Natural,425,Have to try migas tacos    3 taco but they are the size of a breakfast burrito  Have 2 of those and you re set for the morning. Salsas are amazing  green  red and mild. Wish I could try all their menu  Might go back for more soon  Tortillas are fresh and the chips are soooo yummy  crunchy and freshly fried  Can t go wrong  A must try in Austin
Veracruz All Natural,426,We ordered carry out for the breakfast tacos. The amigas were delicious and my friend enjoyed the bits of nachos in them. I liked the steak fajita tacos because they were cooked appropriately and were seasoned well. We ordered about ten various tacos. However  the restaurant would do well to mark which tacos are which  maybe premade stickers or just simple abbreviations . Someone in my party has an allergy to some ingredients so we had to open each taco to see if it had those ingredients  which was inefficient  difficult to tell  and potentially dangerous for her.
Veracruz All Natural,427,The long line and wait are quickly forgotten after the first bite.  These are supreme tacos.  Cannot go wrong with the fish  al pastor or the migas originalles     Watermelon Fresca is ice cold and refreshing and the perfect chaser   the hipster parade and overheard conversations  in line  make for good amusement while waiting in line  but once your order is called  prepare for transcendence.  Enjoy  
Veracruz All Natural,428,Migas taco was really good. I regret only getting one. The taco ingredients were really fresh. Took a while to get our food even though we were one of the only ones there on a Saturday morning.
Veracruz All Natural,429,Crazy good tacos. Be patient with the line though - I recommend coming with coffee if you re there for your Sunday hangover cure.
Veracruz All Natural,430,Took a RideAustin to get to this parking lot food truck... next to a Shell gas station so a really weird location. Not near much else. 35 degrees outside and I had all my luggage  having just flown in. Tired and cold. But. So. Worth. It. Ordered the 2 versions of the migas tacos and the pineapple agua fresca. They had a heated tent but I wanted to eat in private so braved the outside picnic table. Those tacos were amazing. You need at least 2 because they are small. I used the corn tortillas and they came wrapped in foil -- opening it and each steaming bite in that cold November weather - the avocado  the sauces  everything mixed in  too cold and hungry to really study all that care that went into it ... flavors melded together. I loved the crunchies added in there also. Need to eat right away to keep that crunch. The sauces were also great. Agua fresca so cold but en pointe to balance the tacos. Would definitely go back again and again. I can see how they do so well  even in a weird parking lot location.
Veracruz All Natural,431,I went to seven different taco places during my four day stint in Austin and this was my favorite  This little food truck is an amazing place for fresh food. I loved my al pastor taco but the fish taco was the real show-stopper. The mango salsa and avocado topped on the fresh grilled fish was the perfect combo  I also ordered a watermelon agua fresca which was so perfect. The portion are huge  both tacos and beverages   so I left very full given the fact that my bill was only  10.  I came here with three of my friends so sitting down was a little hard in the prime lunch hours but I definitely thought it was worth the wait   30ish minutes from waiting to being served . The outdoor space that they have set up is great and perfect for a sunny day 
Veracruz All Natural,432,Food in Austin is just too good. I m only knocking off a star because the food took 20ish minutes  though she did warn us that it would  and the steak taco was just so-so. The migas were above average. But the star  the star my friends is the al pastor taco with the works.   GET THE AL PASTOR TACO.   Okay  my work here is done.
Veracruz All Natural,433,I m coming back to Austin simply because I want more of their breakfast tacos. Being from Los Angeles  these tacos are unlike anything I ve ever had before in. my. life.   At first I was against breakfast tacos  but I tried it and wanted to go back to Veracruz the next day for more. Next time I m in Austin  I ll be at Veracruz grabbing breakfast 
Veracruz All Natural,434,OMG     Worth...the ....wait  I ve tried so many migas tacos and this one is life changing. Lived in Austin for 4 yrs and currently live in SF where there s no such thing as a breakfast taco. I come here at least three times within my Austin visits and it s amazing every time  Thank you Veracruz  y all really know how to do migas right   
Veracruz All Natural,435,Ok i just e scootered 10 minutes back to my east austin hotel room  washed my hands and face  then got down to my undies amp  turned off the lights- so i could rely only on my tastebuds. I began putting the most delicious flavors in my mouth. One mouthful after another i have never tasted anything so  perfectly tasty- salty  fresh  zesty  so satisfying. These are the best Tacos. I had all the tacos on their menu and washed it down with some sweet pink juice  watermelon. Jeez we  can t say anything these days. Take it easy 
Veracruz All Natural,436,What a great place that represents the best of Austin. Great food made from natural ingredients served from an old bus with a vibe unmatched. If downtown this is a must.
Veracruz All Natural,437,This place was absolutely great. The tacos are phenomenal and the staff was super friendly. Really great green salsa and red salsa options. We had everything from breakfast tacos to regular tacos and all of the options were A . Would definitely go back again.
Veracruz All Natural,438,We came here a little bit before noon on a breezy Thursday. They are located near the shop with hanging pinatas and another food truck nearby. The lot looks sketchy but just park and walk toward the white school bus. Their menu is pretty big  you can customize certain tacos. The prices threw me off because it s pricey for street tacos but you ll see why in a little bit. I asked the lady how big the tacos were since one taco was about  3  and she made them seem like they weren t too big. I ordered two with the thought of coming back and ordering more if I was still hungry. Man  was I wrong.  I ended up getting 2 al pastor tacos on flour. Another perk about this place is that they don t charge you extra for flour. They don t charge you for not eating it authentically  They give you a beeper and you can wait and eat at picnic tables nearby. There are even porta-potties so don t stress that you re eating at a food truck. It didn t take too long  once it beeped  you pick up your tacos at the other end where all the sauces were. The tacos were HUGE. They were each wrapped in foil paper to keep them warm and I didn t even time to take a picture after opening up the foil. These tacos were the biggest street tacos I have ever seen and the size of the pieces of pork were giant cubes. It is definitely worth the  3. The al pastor does stain your hand so have hand sanitizer handy or you can grab some near the sauce. This place looks out for you.  They also have a wide drink menu. We tried cucumber juice which is super fresh and light. We also tried the mango juice and strawberry smoothie. They all tasted super good and come in large containers. I would definitely come back to this place and I recommend it to anyone visiting Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,439,Super delicious  Get the migas  the juices are so big  You can definitely share one with a person  Sooo good 
Veracruz All Natural,440,I stopped early for breakfast one morning to try their breakfast and migas tacos.  Their trailer is located in the trendy  hipster  eastside.  Along with the tacos  I ordered the ubiquitous Topo Chico mineral water to wash it down. Neighboring the trailer food park  is a craft coffee spot where I picked up an Americano.  It took a long while to receive the order. I would hope that the reason was that they were making my tortilla fresh to order. There weren t that many people ahead of my order.   One bite and I was in breakfast taco food heaven.  Of the two tacos  my favorite was the migas tacos. The portion size for each taco were larger than your average street taco. I loved the combination of the crunch inside the taco and pillowy softness of the fresh tortilla on the outside. I was sad that I didn t have to revisit this place again or try other breakfast tacos spots during my visit to Austin to compare.
Veracruz All Natural,441,Can we please taco bout this food truck   Hands down the BEST breakfast tacos in Austin  and I ve had my fair share of them . Fresh  authentic  always piping hot ingredients   amp  fluffy  thick  homemade tortillas make for absolute PERFECTION in the form of taco. The tacos here are reasonably priced  especially for the great quality and decent quantity of their fillings.  Aside from their awesome build-your-own breakfast tacos  I enjoy potatoes and egg   their migas taco is fresh and flavorful  and their fish taco is AMAAAZING    You know how at some places the fish inside of their tacos are overcooked and way too fried crunchy  There is none of that nonsense at Veracruz. The tilapia is wonderfully tender and fresh and MELTS in your mouth  the mango pico adds a lovely sweetness that contrasts with the tanginess of the lime  and the chipotle cream sauce adds a flavorful kick. The cabbage is super crisp. The fish taco is a wonderful blend of flavor and texture  I think probably the best fish taco I ve ever had     crying tears of joy because delicious   Boyfriend and I have ordered the watermelon agua fresca in the past  and it tasted great but was a little sweet. Although it is pricey and definitely a treat  it s a perfect ending  or accompaniment   to a wonderfully-seasoned and flavorful taco  or two...or three .
Veracruz All Natural,442,meh the ham and cheese breakfast taco was okay but the carne asada and pork were blegh
Veracruz All Natural,443,Austin  stahp with the amazing food. I can t handle. So much indulge. Veracruz blessed me with the BEST FISH TACOS I ve ever had. So good we went back for seconds.   The mango juice was also so fresh and not from concentrate. Not to mention it came in a huge 32oz cup  their only size  thanks Texas  
Veracruz All Natural,444,Pros  Really really good taco. Cons  Wait times.  I had some of the best Breakfast Tacos of my life here. The Migas Poblanos is glorious esp. if you add their salsa to it. Not doubting their claim about being one of the nation s top 5 tacos -- so good 
Veracruz All Natural,445,Unwittingly stumbled upon Veracruz for our first meal in Austin on a recent trip  and ended up visiting a second time for a final breakfast taco before flying out of the Great State...two visits in two days was very necessary.   This unassuming food truck nestled next to a Shell and a pinata blow-out store  could anything be better   was a veritable extension of Austin International Airport before our flight out. Three-quarters of customers had luggage in tow before flying out of ATX  and we brushed shoulders with most after reaching the airport.   Pro tip - order the fish taco with mango pico de gallo  but eat it last. Anything that follows just can t compare. Breakfast with the migas  rated the best breakfast taco in Austin and one of the best in the country  or poblanos helps after a night of heavy drinking for an easy  3 a pop.
Veracruz All Natural,446,They hype is real. I m a first generation Mexican immigrant I know tacos. I was raised on tacos. I make my own tortillas  salsa  all that shit. Veracruz is legit  authentic  and freakin delicious. The tortillas are made to order I had a taco that was a little fuller and that tortilla for that taco was a little bigger and thicker. They get it. And YES the migas taco is one of the best I ve ever had. Everything else is good too. Mole on point  fajita is lit  pastor to die for  and the salsa is a masterpiece. Give these guys your hard earned money  they won t disappoint.
Veracruz All Natural,447,Overhyped in my opinion. The tacos were good but not amazing. There are just so many other taco places in Austin that I don t think I d come back again. Maybe I just had high hopes for the place  Or maybe I didn t get the right tacos  The tortillas are okay but not the best I ve ever had.  I got a chorizo and egg taco and the chicken taco. My fianc  got a steak and a chicken taco. The chicken taco was pretty flavorful and everything overall tasted good. My fianc  said the steak was really tender but didn t have a lot of flavor. I really like that the tacos come with avocado  but overall everything seemed kind of pricey for a food truck but I don t know maybe I m just cheap. Hope with their new brick and mortar location the prices don t increase by much    We also got the watermelon aguas frescas  good but again overpriced.  4 for a cup of aguas frescas  I think I d rather go to mi tradicion for aguas frescas where it s less than  3 for a large cup and I can get a variety of foods.   SUMMARY  way better than torchys yes  and it is very authentic. I have no regrets about coming here and recommend checking it out  but for me I didn t find the best taco of my life and wasn t all that impressed. I d rather try another taco place I haven t been too then come again.
Veracruz All Natural,448,This place was highly recommended to us before our first trip to Austin. We stopped for breakfast one morning and it was better than we ever could have dreamed. Bestttt breakfast tacos in town and the guac is sent from heaven  We would go back to Austin just for Veracruz.   4 minute drive to Convention Center  Parking on site Very cheap  very delicious
Veracruz All Natural,449,Migas Poblano all the way. Their fish tacos are pretty good too.  Although their Agua Fresca s are pretty good  they are way overpriced.
Veracruz All Natural,450,The Migas tacos truly are one of the best I ve had   The migas are hot and always fresh and has the right amount of crunch  The line is always pretty long so be ready to wait. The choose two tacos are also good. Make sure to get some of their homemade green salsa.
Veracruz All Natural,451,Hands down the best breakfast taco I ve ever had. And them s fightin  words  I know.
Veracruz All Natural,452,After lots of research before heading over to Austin  TX on where to go for Austin s famous breakfast tacos  I have concluded that Veracruz was the spot to go to. I tried the Breakfast taco with Sausage and Chorizo  but it was only after I got back to LA  that I realized that I got the wrong breakfast taco... The breakfast taco I had was pretty good  but nothing special. I will definitely be back to try the correct taco next time.  Helpful fact  get the Migas taco  voted top 5 in America 
Veracruz All Natural,453,Beef cheeks and lingua were amazing over corn a la dente amazing  Good ppl up front too 
Veracruz All Natural,454,Won t say I m a taco expert  but boy are the tacos good here  Veracruz was just two blocks from where I m staying at Austin  and naturally given I live so close by and all the rave reviews I ve been hearing  I HAD to make a trip here. We had the El Pastor  fish taco and guac  amp  chips - all were excellent. Wish I had room to try out more tacos. We went to a highly-rated Mexican restaurant for lunch that day and Veracruz was much much better. Don t believe they open for dinner so definitely come earlier in the day for Austin s best tacos 
Veracruz All Natural,455,I don t know what I liked more about Austin  how much their people love their tacos  or THESE tacos themselves   After walking back from the ACL fest  my friend and I decided we needed to eat something nearby our hostel - what better than the truck down the block  I ve never seen this type of establishment  a food truck that seconds as a pop-up restaurant and semi-permanent where it s located.  Hands down  the best tacos around  and probably ever.
Veracruz All Natural,456,Wow  this place is as good as all the reviews say.  Mia  Fish  and made my own chorizo egg and cheese on corn tortilla.  Worth eating here.  It s in a little food truck park with minimal parking.  Worth the wait.  I was not a fan of the smoothies.
Veracruz All Natural,457,One of my favorite taco places I have ever been to  This is a MUST try when coming to Austin  TX. I have tried several things and all have been amazing.
Veracruz All Natural,458,O M G  This was probably the best breakfast tacos I have ever had  I want to move to Austin just for this  Trust me  just go and try this out  You won t regret j
Veracruz All Natural,459,We hit up Veracruz and it was truly one of the best taco food trucks we ve had on our trip. I highly recommend eating here  we also really really enjoyed the Aguas Frescas try the strawberry banana    The tacos were packed  and super delicious. I m sad that we only experienced this once  but we ll definitely be returning. Also the chips and salsa were bomb    Great service the staff were really nice too 
Veracruz All Natural,460,Ho-ly SHIT this place was amazing. I should ve read more reviews before I went because the tacos were HUGE   we ordered 7   chips guac for 2 people and ended up taking 2 home.  The tacos are all delicious  cooked very well  amazing seasoning toppings and as noted below are OVERFLOWING. My first impression was the tacos were expensive   3- 4  but after seeing how big they are a great deal. Each taco is definitely twice the size I expected.  MUST TRY  Al Pastor Taco - flavor was amazing  the pineapple and avocado were also delicious with the super tender pork Fish Taco - HUGE fish portion  very fresh tasting  loved the mango pico Salsas - try both. They are craveable.  Agua Fresca  watermelon  - some of the best i ve had. Not overly tart or sweet. and a HUUUGE portion as well  so while  4 seems like a lot you are getting almost 2 portions really. I guess everything is bigger in texas   We also had the migas poblano which was very tasty. And we have yet to eat our steak because we are so full    I really want to try more places in Austin  but I could also eat here every day   
Veracruz All Natural,461,Unfortunate wait time still does not compensate for their amazing migas tacos.    Went to Veracruz last weekend for breakfast.  The good  Their migas tacos are pretty damn good. The bad  Their salsas are kind of  meh  the pastor as well The ugly  Their wait times    45  minutes for some migas tacos... What s going on here   I m not sure what is happening inside the trailer but natural selection should have removed Veracruz from existence a long time ago.  Their saving grace is a cult-like following and lore for their migas taco  which  by all accounts is very good.  Velvety eggs and pillowy fried Tortilla chips  wrapped up in a handmade corn tortilla -- You get it.  Tasty.  However I m pretty sure that  everything  there is hand made including growing the corn for my corn tortillas.  I understand  this is not fast food  however somehow all other restaurants manage to turn out tacos in a decent amount of time.  ...  It s not even like there was a huge crowd waiting for tacos.   A handful of people   Operationally  Torchy s and Tacodeli put this place to shame ... but there always is the migas taco.  I was quoted for 10 minutes for coffee because everyone was busy and instead I ordered an agua fresca.  You know how long it took to pour   ... 10 minutes.  Pro tip  Call ahead  be less disappointed.
Veracruz All Natural,462,There s a reason this place is known for the migas. Best migas tacos I ve ever had. Don t get me wrong the rest of the tacos are great too  but you must get at least one migas if you come. This food truck has a decent amount of seating and is located just off 35 so it s not too hard to find. The staff is friendly and proud of their tacos- as they should be. My friend got a fresh cucumber drink that was delicious and it looked like everyone around us had some sort of fresh fruit drink that I assume were also great. Also  the line moves fast and tacos will come out quick  so don t let that scare you.
Veracruz All Natural,463,Came in after a night on 6th street  except I was the DD so I guess that doesn t mean anything haha. For everyone else who was aboard the struggle bus  the Migas Tacos  the avocado slice makes the difference  seemed to bring them back to life. I also got a breakfast taco that was ham and egg and I could eat 4 of them with the sauce that was in the metal container. I would want to definitely try different variations of the breakfast Taco s though because I usually have breakfast burritos  not tacos so this place claimed my breakfast taco virginity.   I think I got the one that was strawberry banana blended with OJ  may be called the feel good  and that was delicious  I wished I had order the large instead of the regular.    The day that we went it was freezing but they had a tent with a heater inside and a picnic table to sit on so that was really nice while we waited and ate our food.
Veracruz All Natural,464,I ve been here a few times but only ever gotten the migas tacos  so I m only reviewing the tacos and the incredible wait times.   The migas are super delicious  The egg is the right consistency just before you hit dense  the corn tortilla tastes like a homemade grandmother s  and the slice of avocado is  the perfect amount. There s really no reason to eat anything else here. The red salsa pairs with it really well. One taco also fills you up. It gets seven stars out of five.  The wait times are super ridiculous  One star bad  Y all  That s BAD   Delicious  had never been before Thanksgiving weekend  so we phoned in our order ahead of time and were given a thirty minute estimate. Fine  not El Chilito s 5 to 10 minute normal estimate  but way better than the 45 minutes I ve waited before for a breakfast taco  so I ll take it. We asked for coffee when we arrived and was told that there would be a small wait. I asked exactly how long and was told ten minutes. Y all  Ten minutes to brew coffee   Do you have to buy the machine first  WTH  Also  the couple we sat next to complained that they d been waiting over an hour for their order. They eventually left with three bags of tacos  but seriously  very very little is worth that kind of waiting time. Orgasms and iPhones. That s probably it.   I don t think I d ever come here spur of the moment  and every time I try to call in an order and the phone isn t answered  I rule out Veracruszfor the day. But if you can place an order over the phone  this place s migas tacos are well worth the try.
Veracruz All Natural,465,Two words... BREAKFAST TACOS.  My bf and I visited Austin for the first time in September and Veracruz was one of our favorite places. The truck was super close to our Airbnb and so we would start our mornings here. Since we re from Socal  we re used to breakfast burritos and really good Mexican food. Veracruz does not disappoint. I wish we had breakfast tacos in LA   SD  I loved the bacon breakfast tacos and he loved the Barbacoa  only available on the weekend . We both really liked the al pastor. Honestly  I m sure everything on the menu here is delicious. The food comes out in a timely manner because it s all made fresh. There is a good-sized seating area and the prices are decent. Most of the people dining here are locals so you know you are truly eating delicious food   I highly recommend Veracruz if you are in Austin 
Veracruz All Natural,466,Will not be back .  I Ordered the vegan taco and it came out with all veggies and egg  I took it back up and told them no I can t eat the egg .  Got called up again for my new Taco and low and behold this one was nothing but a handful of cheese and veggies .  Took it back another time to say I cannot have the cheese .  Finally got called up once more and this one was just drippy oily spinach and nothing else . No other veggies or anything . I took one bite threw it away and left . Not only that but they were out of every beverage . Nothing to wash down the oil they heavy hand pour on everything .  I had high hopes for this place coming in and I left really disappointed .
Veracruz All Natural,467,Not sure what to do for food .. not a bad option here and the quesadilla is on point  Breakfast tacos are on another level too ..highly recommended 
Veracruz All Natural,468,Best fish tacos in Austin and I love fish tacos and try them all. Best salsa      The one in the scoop it out yourself big pan. I want to drink it like Gazpacho. My daughter also loves the fish tacos as much as me   She s 11    yum yum yum and yum
Veracruz All Natural,469,An early morning walk took us to Veracruz for some breakfast tacos. I tried the Migas and Migas Poblano. Both were very good. The three salsa options were able to add some freshness and spice to the tacos and really brought some flavor 
Veracruz All Natural,470,My boyfriend and I visited Austin last week and breakfast tacos were on our to-do list. Veracruz was highly recommended to us by a friend that lives in Austin  he hyped it up and we decided to try it our last morning there.   The tacos and juice were worth every minute we waited in line under the hot Texas sun   20 minutes to be specific.  We ordered 4 tacos  chips and guac  and one watermelon juice. I think we would ve been okay with just 2 tacos  chips and guac. The tacos come full packed with avocado  chicken  cheese... just delicious  The guac was very simple  which to me is the best. The watermelon juice was one of the best I have ever had  very refreshing also.  Only con to this place is that it is outside so during the summer you do get a little hot but it s worth it. I will definitely be back.
Veracruz All Natural,471,This little school bus makes magic in a tortilla  Chips and guac are made fresh. The guacamole is more of chunky consistency than smooth aka the best kind. The mango fresca was hands down one of the most delicious drinks I ve ever had   Even if you re not a mango fan  which would be weird   grab one of their frescas    And for the tacos....heaven in a rainbow blanket. I ordered the migas poblanas and chorizo egg. I normally don t even like peppers but that poblano though...grilled to perfection  You can order your tacos with either corn or flour tortillas  but if you like tasty food  go with corn.
Veracruz All Natural,472,Damn good tacos.... but only if you can avoid the wait. I went one day and there was at least an hour wait... line was barely moving. No thanks. I don t like to wait hours for food.   I came super early another morning and still had about a 10 minute wait. We got the migas and al pastor tacos. I thought migas was the star  everyone else does too .   These were not life changing tacos but tasty options.
Veracruz All Natural,473,Like many others in Austin  I am here to say that the tacos at Veracruz are the best tacos in the city. What separates them in my eyes are three fold. 1.  Their corn Tortillas. Every great taco starts with a great tortilla  and the corn tortillas are the best I have had in Austin so far. 2. They have the freshest ingredients  and you can absolutely taste it. 3. The quality of their meat and how tender and flavorful the meat is....is unbeatable. The meat here separates its from the rest. I have had all of their tacos  and their migas taco is award winning  but I find myself ordering the pork  Al Pastor  and steak tacos...even at 8 00 am. i just cant get enough of them.
Veracruz All Natural,474,Very good tacos. The pastor had the texture of a pulled pork with little bits of pineapple and was both light and tangy. The migas were highly touted by food reviewers and held up as a rock solid rendition of eggs  potatoes  poblanos  cheese  and avocado perfectly mixed together. There s a coffee stand inside that does good work. You can come here and eat a healthy and large meal and get great coffee.
Veracruz All Natural,475,Closed at 1 pm     No phone number to contact.  What a waste of time and gas.  There was no explanation as to why they were closed at 1 vs 3 pm like it says online. NEGATIVE STARS ON MY END.
Veracruz All Natural,476,This place is amazing  Best tacos  breakfast and regular  that we ve ever had. Our favorites were the Migas and el pastor. Their fresh juice was good too 
Veracruz All Natural,477,The tacos were good but I felt like this place was over-hyped.  I had a miga breakfast taco  chorizo taco  and fish taco. They were all good  but the service was really slow and unorganized.  I get that it s a food truck  kind of  but it has 2 windows and clearly they have a system down.  One of my friend s orders was so messed up  she ended up having to order 3 times to get it right.  Once she got the receipt in her email it was like  ok that s not what I said....And then when I went to get my food  I got someone else s order and we had to figure out that mess.  The wait was fairly long  maybe close to 30 minutes.  For tacos.  I was just visiting so I am no expert on the tact scene  but it s Texas there are lots of taco options right   But they weren t as overpriced as food trucks usually are  so if you re in the neighborhood and the wait isn t crazy  go for it.  The tacos were way more filling than I expected  I just tasted me 2nd two tacos because I was full but wanted to know how they were.
Veracruz All Natural,478,Best. Breakfast. Tacos. Ever  Came to Austin for the weekend and left so satisfied    Got the migas. Changed my life. I ll never be the same woman after these tacos and they gave me all the energy I needed. The freshly squeezed orange juice was divine.   Overall  just incredibly delicious. If I was a local  I could certainly eat here multiple times a week.   TRY THE MIGAS 
Veracruz All Natural,479,Came in late Sunday morning with a bunch of friends  craving breakfast tacos on our last day of our trip in Austin. Ordered two tacos for myself  and tried cactus for the first time. YUM. It wasn t as crunchy as I had expected  but it had absorbed all the juices from the chorizo that I had ordered it with.  The line was a little long  and the wait for food was even longer. I suppose this is to be expected as all food is made to order. We did see many people before and after us ordering watermelon drinks  which sounded delicious in the summer heat  but I just didn t want to wait in line again. Turns out drinks come out a lot faster than food  oh well...
Veracruz All Natural,480,The migas breakfast taco is hands down the best breakfast taco I ve ever had in my life. The tortilla is never soggy. The tortilla chips inside are always crunchy. The cheese is always melted perfectly. The peppers  avocados  and onions all taste so fresh. I ve eaten at this Veracruz and the others  and I have never had a subpar migas breakfast taco. Sometimes I get the migas poblanos  which is also great. The poblano really adds another layer of sweet crunchiness. I love all three salsas  but my favorite is the spiciest one.
Veracruz All Natural,481,Authentic and delicious Mexican food. Hard to find here in Austin.  rale   Lot of love put into everything.  Thank you 
Veracruz All Natural,482,Sunday morning and waiting 45 minutes for our tacos once we placed our order.... Ordering online requires you to create an account and password.  Clunky and painful process just to get a few breakfast tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,483,In from out of town and the wanting true Austin breakfast tacos  the Yelp guided us here last Saturday. We were not disappointed.  Between the two of us  we tried a chorizo  pastor and steak taco. All were good  but the pastor was amazing. I usually order corn tortillas  but opted for flour. A serendipitous change  as their flour tortillas were spectacular.  If I had to guess  I would think they were made to order.   The hot sauces and salsa were a great accompaniment and the guacamole was perfect.   Took some restraint to not go back on Sunday.
Veracruz All Natural,484,We had Migas originales and poblanos. Also had chille relleno. Loved it all. They could with little less sodium  that s the only thing. Everything else- hygiene  decor  staff  wait time etc. was very good. I recommend this place.
Veracruz All Natural,485,Some of the best food I ve put in my mouth   Be prepared to wait but so worth it   Migas taco a MUST 
Veracruz All Natural,486,If you need your taco fix this is definitely the place you want to go. The ingredients are fresh and the flavor is bold. There may be a long line but it goes fast and is worth the wait. Pictured is the migas and the fish taco  both were amazing but if I had to choose my favorite it would be the fish taco . Also had the Al Pastor and chorizo and egg. Cant go wrong. They also have fresh fruit juices and smoothies that looked refreshing
Veracruz All Natural,487,Honestly  I didn t think it was possible. When something has been so overhyped and your expectations are so astronomically high  you always have that tiny voice in the back of your head saying  prepare to be let down . Even when you temper your expectations because you re a food-realist  you still can t shake the opinions of throngs of hipsters  foodies  and bloggers who stake their reputation on this particular hill. As it turns out  I have now been to the mountaintop  and it was  better than  good.   In all seriousness  these were potentially some of the best tacos I ve ever tasted in the US  rivaling the best I ve had in San Diego  San Antonio  and Chicago  side note  if anyone tells you San Francisco has the best tacos  just walk away  there s no known cure for sure delusion . Honestly  I couldn t find a single flaw in Veracruz All Natural s taco game. The tortillas were doughy without being undercooked. They had the perfect pliability. The size was right. You didn t feel like they were throwing street tacos at you to mask cheating you out of tortilla. But  you also didn t feel like you had to tuck the ends to keep from having leftover tortilla butts. The content was proportioned right and cooked perfectly. The migas poblanas did an excellent job of ensuring the chili didn t overpower the eggs. The la reyna blended the ingredients well  ensuring you tasted the flavor combinations instead of tasting something different in each bite. Even the make your own combination couldn t miss.   The only real critique I have is that the wait was ridiculous and the patio space was gross. They really should hire someone to just maintain the outside  clear tables  restock salsas  sweep the patio  keep away birds  etc . But  the food was that good  it s easy to forgive the lack of general maintenance. If you want the best breakfast tacos out there  give this place a try.
Veracruz All Natural,488,We arrived before they even opened and were expecting a long line but we were the only ones there. We order the migas which were pretty good but not as amazing and awesome as we had been expecting. A bit bland and a bit over priced.
Veracruz All Natural,489,Don t click on the map because it gives the wrong pinpoint   Anyway  after going in circles to different locations  we finally found the place.  Line isn t so long and is worth maybe a 10 minute wait.  Since it is a truck  you ll be seated outdoors.  There s shared shared tables  around but the majority seems to be near garbage and dumpsters.  So you will have flies around you while eating.  Other than that  all tasted great.   35 for 3 tacos  a special  agua fresca  coffee  and bottled water.  The al pastor was my favorite among the tacos.  The watermelon fresca was good too.
Veracruz All Natural,490,Yes  the tacos  the tacos -- but have y all tried their chicken quesadilla  It is huge and giant. You can split that and a giant aqua fresca  so good  so freaking good  with a friend and call it a meal.   I don t understand people who complain about the wait. Why is it OK to wait 15-20 minutes for your food at a sit-down restaurant but not a food truck  I don t expect food trucks to be like fast food. In fact  I don t want them to be like that.
Veracruz All Natural,491,All I can say is having lived in Austin 10 years and eaten taco nearly every day  Veracruz is by far and away my first choice and favorite spot. Their natural ingredient tacos are better than homemade.
Veracruz All Natural,492,Stopped here with my family as we were on our way back to Dallas and omg  Best decision ever  We happened to run into it and we said what the heck let s try it. My fiance is from San Diego and the whole vibe around here made him feel like he was back in Cali  The food and the aguas frescas were amazing  We had the Taco al Pastor Fish Taco Steal Taco and some chips and guacamole. Everything was superb  I even took another Sandia Agua to go  Will definitely be coming back here again 
Veracruz All Natural,493,I have been on Austin for 6 years now and this has by far been my Favorite place for tacos  I know strong to say but best tacos in Austin  Always fresh  great flavors  great sauces  I could live off of their tacos everyday all day 
Veracruz All Natural,494,These tacos are as good as people say they are    On my third trip to Austin I finally had the opportunity to grub on some Veracruz  the other two attempts were made on a weekend and there was no way I was waiting in the crazy lines . We came on a Monday around 11am and there were only a couple people in line. There are a few parking spaces in the adjacent lot but street parking is probably easier.   I had a migas taco and an al pastor taco. My husband had a migas and a egg cheese chorizo. They were allllllll soooooo goooooood. That migas  man it s tasty    I feel like there s sazon or some kind of msg-something it in cause the lingering savory flavor in your mouth is not of this world. Thinking about it now  I wish I had 6 in front of me    I recommend 2-3 tacos per person. I wish we didn t have a juice somewhere else before we arrived cause the frescas looked oh-so refreshing. Next time....
Veracruz All Natural,495,I was in Austin for a weekend and had read that I must try the migas breakfast taco here. BOY AM I GLAD I DID  Truly the most delicious taco of my life. It was so full of flavor and seriously the perfect combination of spice and ingredients- eggs  pico  avocado  and oh goodness those tortilla chips  Literally oozing with flavor. Now if only they could bring this tastiness to Los Angeles 
Veracruz All Natural,496,The truck has finally landed on Manchaca  And all I can say is that I wish it were closer to me.  But it sits right next door to my cousin s place on the lot of Radio Coffebar and that s a good thing. Radio and Veracruz make great synergy  A match made in hipster heaven.  Just imagine the best tacos ever with some cool coffee people right next door. OK  if that isn t specific enough  the roll this in your tortilla and drink it....  The Migas taco  Perfectly textured and tasty.  The Chicken Mole taco  Earthy and streety. The corn tortillas  Fresh and toasty. The salsas  They have that really authentic pale green stuff that rocks  Absolutely Rocks. I wish I knew what it was called. And their red. Ohh...almost tastes garlicky. Very cool They both mix mex exceedingly well.   In addition to those tacos I also accidentally took receipt of a chorizo taco. The idea of eating chorizo by itself is...strange...to say the least. Not sure what to say other than  I didn t ask for or pay for it so....thanks  .  I would say that 2 and a half tacos make a very filling meal.  You will not find a huge selection of meat options such as lengua  but what you do get is very fresh  very hot and very tasty. I have decided that I WILL sit out under the hot summer sun in South Austin to enjoy it. Time and again. Oh  and the hibiscus mint tea next door is great too....but that is another topic for another day.
Veracruz All Natural,497,Every time I go the employees are so rude to me. I don t care how cheap and good something is. I don t need to be talked down too. Atleast this is the Round Rock Store.
Veracruz All Natural,498,So  I tried 3 tacos  the Veracruz Migas didn t really move me. I found it dry and while I liked the crunch  it was pretty bland. You shouldn t need salsa to make a taco have flavor.     I did enjoy my combo breakfast taco that I stuffed with all sorts of fillings. I also got the Al Pastor -- those were my favs and I left the Migas uneaten.  Pretty straightforward  they have a few tables next to a gated up plot of green land so it s a bit picturesque. It can be tough to get into out of the driveway given traffic and it s only a 2 lane road. Parking lot is a dirt patch with a handful of spots so  it can be a little tight. Pricing is pretty good.  The buzzer system is weird -- sometimes it buzzes  sometimes they call out your number. And  the condiments -- were not checked up on   kept tidy and they were running out  scraping the bottom of the containers running out .
Veracruz All Natural,499,Both the fish taco and the steak taco were amazing here  The steak wasn t over cooked and tasted really good with the light green salsa that had a good kick to it. The fish taco had some chopped up mango pieces and it was super fresh  10 10 recommend
Veracruz All Natural,500,The wait for well worth it. The tacos are wholesome and delicious and the Agua frescas  I had cucumber  during the summer was a godsent   Must go 
Granny's Tacos,1,Great tacos  Nice size  Great taste    The wait wasn t bad when I got there. There was a family in front of me that didn t know what to order so that took 10 minutes for them to decide. Please know what you want before you step to the front.  Lady taking orders looked annoyed at folks that didn t know the basics  like salsa.  What salsa do you have   Sign is up front bud. And guess what  Usually it s red or green.   After ordering  it did take some time to get the food  but I didn t mind. Probably 20 minutes for 4 tacos  but probably because that family in front ordered a lot.   Will be back.
Granny's Tacos,2,One of my favorite breakfast tacos ever  It s quick service  has a good amount of outdoor seating  and absolutely delicious food.   I got the Machaca Taco and devoured all of it. It was packed with flavor and filling for a morning bite   Highly recommend stopping by one of their two locations.
Granny's Tacos,3,Reminds me of the food my nanny used to make in Mexico City  Comforting  very homemade stewed meats served up with tortillas. Greasy. Warm. Seasoned with the knowledge and wisdom of her ancestral cooks.   Granny s Tacos may call one of their offerings  al pastor   which it most definitely is not. Rather  it is another Mexican delicacy - cochinita pibil - pork cooked with achiote  an exquisite paste featuring the annatto seed from the tropical achiote tree. Wish they served them with the traditional red pickled onions  too.   The Granny taco is another kind of stewed pork  served with a heap of onions  pico de gallo  a slice of avocado and lime.   This food truck must serve up half an onion with each taco and that s delish.   Their handmade corn tortillas are a mess  though. I don t know how they can even call them tortillas. They re more like thin  wet  flavorless focaccia.   I inhaled the taco fillings and dumped the offending bread.
Granny's Tacos,4,Soooooo yummy  Worth a trip to Austin. Mole breakfast taco... whaaaat   My only regret is not getting more.
Granny's Tacos,5,Decided to try Granys Tacos  went on weekday morning  so not much crowded  Ordered chips with guacamole and salsa  Migas  shrimp taco and Rico taco. Loved the chips  they were thick and nice  not like thin  the one you get it in supermarkets. Migas and shrimp were good  my son absolutely love mole sauce  so obviously he got Rico taco  but he said it s too dry and more than that  way way too salty  so dint wanted to eat after a bite  hubby took a tiny bite and confirmed it  so that was absolute waste. Guy at the truck was good  if you re in the area  give it a try   
Granny's Tacos,6,Granny s Tacos has been our go-to place for our taco fix.  Sometimes they are out of our favorite green salsa. Sometimes an ingredient or two gets forgotten  like a slice of avocado or bell peppers or jalape o. But they ve been pretty consistent lately  and everything has been on point. Tacos are generouly stuffed and very messy to eat. All is right with the world.  Today I remembered to take photos before we started our feeding frenzy.
Granny's Tacos,7,Had the abuela  shrimp  and Birria. All were really sauce and tasty  Really enjoyed the sauciness 
Granny's Tacos,8,Such a hidden gem in the outskirts of downtown Austin  I found this place as I was searching for a place to get some breakfast tacos nearby Franklin s BBQ as I waited on the ridiculous line for 5 hours. I stumbled upon Granny s Tacos which looked pretty legit online so I had to try it for myself. I was not disappointed  In fact  it ended up being my FAVORITE breakfast taco    I only ordered one breakfast taco since my wife and I were going to have a heavy lunch at Franklin s. Omg I wish I had some more the next day... it was so delish  Juicy  flavorful  the salsa was fresh and citrusy  and spicy. The lady at the window recommended the Machaca breakfast taco which came with braised beef  eggs  avocado  onions  tomato  and cilantro on a flour tortilla with your choice of a side of salsa. They have mild green  medium roasted chili  and hot red. I got the roasted chili which was orange in color - so delicious   5 5 solid food truck serving up the BEST breakfast tacos  in my opinion. I d definitely come back again.
Granny's Tacos,9,Fresh overflowing breakfast tacos. Totally no frills but so tasty. My wife got the mole and it was balanced and tasty. The eggs were clearly fresh and well seasoned. The corn tortillas were nicely chewy.
Granny's Tacos,10,Y all  Ray hooked it up and took us to flavor town with his delicious tacos  I had the chicken which was  chefs kiss  and the Al pastor which was also delicious. Him and his son are so kind and holding down the tacos in ATX. Everything was fresh down to the chips and tortilla and the quality spoke for itself it was 10 10. I had them at Blues on the Green but will definitely be heading there after some bailando on East 7th.
Granny's Tacos,11,I feel like these tacos are larger than usual. You really only need two and I couldn t really finish my third. I got the migas type one that also had chicharrones  incredible  along with a picadillo steak one and a custom breakfast one. No real complaints. Everything was quite good. I wish they gave you more salsa.
Granny's Tacos,12,Breakfast Taco was one of the food on our list in Austin. Everyone said we must try breakfast taco coming here so we did   Granny Taco is a food truck located on a busy street. There is street parking available and few spots in the parking lot.  We got the breakfast taco  Ranchero and Mexican coke  There was some hiccups with our order. We wanted only egg and turkey sausage taco but got charged for chorizo as well. The guy who took our ordered insisted that we did order chorizo. There was no avocado in the ranchero because they were out. It would be nice if they tell us about any unavailable items before we order foods. Anyway always check your order and make sure it is correct. Lots of people ordered before us also got their orders wrong. Maybe it was an off day.  There is outdoor seating near the truck and condiments are available upon request  There might be better breakfast taco place out there so I would probably explore other options 
Granny's Tacos,13,Get here early to avoid the lines    We waited in line about 30 minutes and luckily by the time we ordered our food  some of the people were getting up so we d have a place to eat. I got the abuela taco  al pastor and a brekkie taco with egg and potato. The egg and potato taco was ok  but the abuela was our favorite. It was so freaking flavorful with the pork adobo   It came with pico and avocado. I really wanted to try the Rico but they didn t have mole    overall  I think it s comparable to the other taco places in Austin  but that abuela taco def stands out from the rest  Street parking is avail where you can find a spot 
Granny's Tacos,14,Everything we got was delicious. The favorite was the Migas  but the Machaca was good as well. My daughters shared a torta. We also got a steak burrito which was enormous  it felt like it weighed 5 pounds. We were there around 11am on Sunday and our order was ready in about 20 minutes. I also walked to Revelry around the corner to get a latte which was good too.
Granny's Tacos,15,And now for the actual  very first taco joint we visited as part of our Austin swing... Picture this   It s 9 30 in the morning. And there s already a long-line of disheveled millenial and maybe even younger looking patrons  yawning- patiently waiting for their breakfast taco fix. From this  their locally favorite taco food truck.  The best thing we had here was their shrimp taco. I wouldn t put this place in my top 10 taco stands in Austin. But it was pretty delish.
Granny's Tacos,16,GET THE SHRIMP TACO   It was the highlight of the meal and so friggen good. A must get   We also got two steak tacos which were super salty and overcooked    The meat portion was huge though. The birria taco was decent but nothing really special. Overall  I would come back for the shrimp tacos but everything else we tried wasn t worth it.
Granny's Tacos,17,Why 5 stars  Because I think I may have just eaten the best tacos of my life.             Everything was going against me in this situation.  I had just driven about 2 hours and 40 minutes from Houston.  I had to pee pretty badly at the halfway point but elected to ride it out to the end.  When I arrived in Austin  my bladder was approaching a Level 7 emergency  there are only 5 Levels .  Of course  Granny s is only a food truck with no attached toilet for your convenience.  I attempted to park in the nearest lot. When I swiped my credit card  the machine just said  Please wait  in perpetuity. Perpetuity in my case was probably 90 seconds  but it felt like 3.5 months before I just gave up and drove away. Chances of fraudulent charges hitting my account any day now   87 .  I looked around for street parking. Finally found a spot that looked halfway legit. A nearby sign said I could swipe my card or download an app. It felt like the end was near for me  so the amount of time it would have taken to download an app and set up an account made that option a non-starter.   I quickly swiped my card  only for the machine to act like something happened  followed by it immediately returning to the main screen. Identity fraud  2 coming right up.  Eventually  the machine worked. I somehow walked to Granny s  and then just past Granny s to a coffee wine bar. I apologize to the owners here for using your restroom without making a purchase. Your plumbing saved my life on this day.     Now that you know I lived  time for the actual Granny s review     I was studying the menu  when the guy opened his window and asked what I wanted. I was overwhelmed and felt not quite ready  so I had to wing it. I knew that the Abuela Taco was the  1 highlight  so that s all I was certain I needed to order. I clumsily blurted out three others. Let s talk about them all   Abuela  Ironically  this is the only one that I was unimpressed by. It was fine  don t get me wrong  but I wouldn t need to order it again.  The other three  I could eat them every day for the next 50 years.  The Shrimp  the Campechano and the Acambre. Sadly  I am not even 100  sure which was which between the latter two. I  think  The Campechano was my favorite  but I kind of got confused which was which. It s the one on the top-right in my photo.  Either way  all three of these were just incredible. Every bite. Why do all tacos not taste like this  What does Granny s do differently  I have no idea.  All I know is that a 5-star average with over 400 reviews as of my visit is well-deserved. It s going to be hard to come back to Austin again without stopping here.  EDIT  Came back again on my last day in Austin. Ordered a migas and a breakfast taco with eggs  bacon and chorizo. All other tacos that I eat for the rest of my life will pale in comparison to Granny s.
Granny's Tacos,18,Lived up to the hype  Amongst the plethora of tacos I ve tried in Austin  this place has cracked my personal top 5. Mostly because of how well they season and cook their proteins. Green sauce is delicious. It reminds me of the do a at Tacodeli  which is easily the best part of that chain.  Shrimp taco is an absolute must  as many have mentioned. Light and delicious. The shrimp is seasoned and cooked perfectly. So easy to overcook shrimp but no  theirs were plump and juicy. All of the toppings worked so well together. No salsa needed   Abuela was also very good. Fatty and unctuous but don t be alarmed by all the braising liquid sauce  it s not as heavy as it looks. Meat is melt in your mouth tender  unlike some shredded meats that can stringy and tough. Pour a little of that green sauce to cut the richness and you get the perfect bite.   Ranchero was slightly disappointing. I love chicharron but it kind of got lost in the taco  or not enough of it. The corn chips are a nice touch but a bit overpowering. I should ve ordered the Machaca instead.  The guy taking orders was very efficient  yet patient and friendly at the same time. Few people ahead of me and all of our orders came out in a timely manner. Everything is reasonably priced. 100  recommend.
Granny's Tacos,19,Came down to Texas to visit Austin and I knew the food seen was amazing. I did my usual yelp search to try to find a great taco spot. This place did not disappoint. I was easily able to pull up and sit at one of the many picnic tables they had. They had a variety of different tacos to choose from. I had gone there for breakfast tacos but I got a variety of different kinds to eat with my husband. The tacos were actually really big so I could only finish two. The tacos were so flavorful and unique compared to the taco trucks we have in Alabama. I had a breakfast taco which had egg cheese chorizo. I also ordered a chicken mole. We dove in when we got our tacos  It was so delicious.
Granny's Tacos,20,Slap a lap. This place ain t joking around.  Machaca. Alambre. Standouts for sure Ranchero.  Birria. Also good but not quite on that same esteemed level as the aforementioned tacos.  Friends said the Migas was incredible as well.  Slightly messy  but I mean... what kind of the best tacos are not   With that being said  they were out of chorizo and Abuela tacos at  11AM on a Saturday  Disappointing but just a reason to come back. Not my favorite hot sauces anyways but those tacos arguably don t need the flavor  but I like my spice so put some on.  Outdoor seating is what is available. Nice coffee shop next door.
Granny's Tacos,21,Visiting Austin and we decided to go on what we are calling a  Taco Tour.  We stopped at many different taco shops trucks in the downtown area. While there are too many delicious options to count  Granny s came out on top as my ultimate favorite  WOW   Such a hearty  delicious  flavorful taco. I went with the Picadillo and was blown away. My only regret is not trying more tacos from the menu. Everything looked so good    I also loved the atmosphere and vibe. The staff was so kind in recommending tacos and helped us to have a great experience.   Will for sure be back anytime I m in the area 
Granny's Tacos,22,We decided to try this restaurant for lunch.... Ok.... It s a good truck but keep in mind they close early.. there is outdoor seating  but the heat is brutal even with umbrellas..  the ordering process was easy  They have a few selections on the menu... The food took maybe 20 minutes or less to come out..  I ordered a shrimp taco and chicken taco  my husband ordered the Birria Taco  my son- chicken quesadilla and my daughter a chicken taco.. we ordered nachos as well..  chicken taco was average  but the Shrimp taco was FIRE    It had the perfect amount of spice and the shrimp was flavorful.. I could ve done without the cooked onions  but it was ok..  The Birria Tacos based on my husband s input was average.. the quesadillas were cheesy and overstuffed  but it did have good flavor..  couldn t really enjoy is because it kept falling apart...the nachos ehhh... the chips were buried under all beans  chicken and cheese. They topped it off with sliced hass avocado  which were brown on each side and not brown because they were cut in advance  brown because they were going bad and it also had the sour flavor.. and not a sour flavor from the lime juice.. So for the drinks we ordered Jarritos... Imagine being in 99 degree weather and being handed warm drinks...after waiting outside patiently for your order to be ready... my husband asked the lady inside the truck if the had ice  she replied  Rudely   we don t have no ice.   And closed the window.. Not really impressed with this 5 star rated food truck... The location we went to had Portable Bathrooms right behind the truck and the smell was awful.. we moved a few tables away and didn t smell it anymore but the closer you are to the truck  the worse it is...  So to be honest  There is room for growth here  starting with the basics... Cold Drinks... I mean c mon  Austin is HOT and you re handing people warm drinks... hmmm...  Overall  average tacos  service is ehh...
Granny's Tacos,23,Let me tell you about their tacos. They taste amazing. I got the Machaca on corn  so that the tortilla soaked up all the delicious flavor from the meat juices. The shrimp taco was made with fresh thick shrimp and seasoned to perfection.   The salsas were negligible since each taco was already balanced in flavor.  So why not 5 stars  Well the salsas were not great. The chips and guac were bland. There s seating but you ll have to fight the grackles for your food. The parking is paid.  A phenomenal taco food truck that I ll be back for if I m picking up some tacos on the go 
Granny's Tacos,24,Amazing tacos  Fast and friendly and fantastic tasting.    Stopped by here on the way back from a tough day at the airport. Was rewarded with a very tasty breakfast taco    Very popular place...easy to see why.
Granny's Tacos,25,This is an awesome tucked away gem. Staff was great  there s some outdoor seating  and the tacos were the best in Austin in my opinion.  I had a chorizo egg cheese and migas. Both were awesome  Definitely worth it to go if you re in town.
Granny's Tacos,26,We stopped here first on our self guided taco tour of Austin. We tried the sausage and bacon tacos. The sausage was cut up hotdog  maybe this is a normal type of sausage here  but we were surprised as it wasn t what we are used to . Bacon was cooked to perfection. Very filling breakfast tacos but somewhat bland. The rojo side sauce was a great addition to spice them up.
Granny's Tacos,27,Wishing I could wake up tomorrow and it was Sunday morning in Austin all over again.   Being Hispanic and living in San Antonio  I have eaten my fair share of breakfast tacos  so when I find tacos that stand out  I am always nicely surprised.   Granny s came to play  First  the service was excellent. Prompt but not rushed. Cashier helped me make my decision of the Alambre with chicken  which was delicious. My partner chose the chillaquilles with green salsa. I am usually let down with most chillaquilles I have eaten  but these were by far top 3 I have ever had. I wanted to dump out her taco s contents  throw some shredded chicken  and an egg on top.   Prices  with the exception of the Mexican coke  were very reasonable. So many other breakfast tacos to try in such little time  but I will definitely be back - sooner than later.
Granny's Tacos,28,Pretty much the best breakfast taco I ve ever had in my life   I got the chorizo  egg  and cheese breakfast taco and it was honestly amazing  It was so good  that it turned back around and ordered a second one right after finishing it.  I also ordered the Picadillo taco with steak and potatoes which was delicious and the Abuela taco  which was also good  but I m not as much of a fan of marinated pork.   The tacos are pretty hefty  so I think 2 would be adequate if you re not too hungry and 3 would be a good number if you re hungry 
Granny's Tacos,29,amazing tacos in austin texas  i always get the shrimp one and it s so delicious. the flavor  portion size  and freshness is all there 
Granny's Tacos,30,Came here for some breakfast tacos and they were great  I love that they have covered tables here - we were able to enjoy both the wait time and our tacos here. Our table enjoyed the Machaca and Veggie Breakfast Tacos.   For parking  we parked on the street near by. There isn t coffee offered here but it is located right by Revival Coffee so it was nice walking over there after and getting a nice coffee from there too.
Granny's Tacos,31,Granny s is probably the best tacos I ve had in Austin  A group of us swung over here for a late lunch. PSA  they make everything fresh but also make each order individually  instead of bulk making certain repeat orders  so it could be a decent wait to get your tacos esp if you re in a large group. I think there were 5 or 6 orders ahead of me and I waited 10-15 min. That s really my only complaint  the wait time.   Onto the food...I ordered the Alambre  steak  bell peppers  chorizo  bacon  avocado  cheese melted over top   the Abuela  marinated pork  pico avocado   and the Al Pastor. My favorite by far was the Alambre  a little oily but the steak was quite tender and the mix of flavors with the bacon and melted cheese were to die for. You can also get it with chicken instead of steak  was their recommendation  so I would try that next time. Al Pastor was my  2 - succulent pork with nice sweetness from pineapple  this was also pretty messy so come prepared with napkins and a fork  Finally  the Abuela comes in at the end of the best for me. The menu says  marinated  but it didn t really hit the spot. The pork was also pretty dry  especially when compared to the Al Pastor. I wouldn t get this taco again.   Overall  fantastic food being served from this taco truck  This is a must have the next time I m in Austin. My friends also gave the breakfast tacos rave reviews  so I ll have to try those too 
Granny's Tacos,32,Hands down the best tacos in all of Austin  with plenty of options for everyone  As a vegetarian I have yet to be let down with their breakfast tacos or specialty tacos. They offer plenty of dining options including ordering ahead or delivery with Favor or dine in at their food truck.   Highly recommend trying the chicken mole to get something different  amp  flavorful.
Granny's Tacos,33,We have family in town and she was wanting something new and different. I wasn t sure what to look for but just started browsing. I came across Granny s and seen they had multiple different yummy options to choose from and I recognized the area from the Trending Machines event by Revival coffee  I chose that spot because it was a short ride and knew there was parking for that area.   You pull up and park right by the food truck and there are picnic tables with umbrellas outside if you wanted to eat there. Your order your food and they give you a ticket number.   I ordered the steak torta and family ordered 2 tacos  Abuela taco  amp  shrimp taco . The torta is huge so its worth the price and everything tastes fresh to order. Bread was soft and warm  the steak was tender  amp  they put just the right amount of cheese. The torta was very good  full of flavor and I was told the tacos were delicious as well along with the salsas given with the food. He puts a good amount of shrimp in the taco and they are a good size as well. You are getting your money s worth.   I highly recommend this food truck and I will come back for more and make this my torta spot. It tastes like you just had abuela s food at home. YUM YUM 
Granny's Tacos,34,Way tastier than it looks. There s a reason why this place is so busy and often runs out of meat...it s that good   My boyfriend and I came on a Saturday afternoon and ordered a chilaquile taco and a marinated pork taco because they were out of beef. We had to wait a bit for the tacos  but they were so worth it   The tacos were super flavorful and yummy. Definitely the best tacos we had in Austin    Come early to enjoy all that they have to offer 
Granny's Tacos,35,Taco truck in Austin that I wish I had known about earlier  Friend recommended this place and I was blown away by the quality of it.  Abuela  marinated pork  pico  avocado  - this taco is singlehandedly the most delicious thing I tasted when I was in Austin. packed full of flavor in every bite carne asada taco - just plain and boring compared to the abuela
Granny's Tacos,36,Tacos are almost a religion in Austin and according to the reviews it seems that Granny s Tacos may be one of its holiest places. With only one day in the city I had to make a pilgrimage to this mecca.  It seems that just like the actual pilgrimage to mecca  getting to Granny s is a perilous journey filled with staggering highs and depressing lows. We easily spent 20 minutes searching for parking that wasn t ridiculously priced. We prowled side alleys  crawled past full lots looking for open spots  and even debated a quick and dirty illegal maneuver. In the end  we squeezed ourselves against a sagging fence  between a telephone pole and another precariously parked vehicle  several blocks away.  After we found a safe-ish spot to stow the car we were finally able to taste these legendary tacos. We ordered an abuela  a shrimp  and a steak taco to give us a good variety to sample. Washing it down with jarritos is almost a requirement.  I ll tell you one thing  before even putting a drop of sauce on any of these tacos the flavor was fantastic. The proteins were cooked perfectly with incredible seasoning across the board. Sauces were a nice touch if you wanted heat or a little something extra  but I honestly didn t need them. The tastes were powerful all on their own.  Surprising no one who reads these reviews  the shrimp taco was the MVP of the group. Huge pieces of shrimp that burst with flavor when you bit into them. If I swing by again I m ordering two of those bad boys.  Now you may wonder why the 4 star rating. Honestly  the parking situation wa so atrocious that incredible tacos can t make up for it. They could ve been gold foil tortillas and gem encrusted fillings and it still wouldn t have made the grueling hunt for parking worthwhile. It s a shame  but at least I got to try them once and see that  most  of the hype was correct.
Granny's Tacos,37,The Abuela Taco was so good and PHAT   1 order was plenty. It s loaded with rice and chicken.  Quick way to get your mole fix in.  Also had a side order of guacamole and chips. The guacamole was chunky and so fresh I got the little bellybutton part of the avocado lol chips  were perfectly crunchy  not stale at all.  3 salsa options. Worth trying them all.  I still think my mom s salsas are better  but this place beats most I ve tried in Austin so far.   Luckily got the there  before noon  so it wasn t busy yet. My order was ready in less than 5 minutes.
Granny's Tacos,38,Looking for the BEST breakfast tacos in Austin  Look no further  Ever since I discovered Granny s I recommend it widely to folks traveling to the Austin area. After stopping for coffee next door  breakfast tacos was my next move.   I had the chicharr n and steak breakfast tacos. They were both delish. The chicharr n was crunchy and abundant. Hoping to stop one more time here before I head back to Boston.
Granny's Tacos,39,This was one of our last stops on our way back to Houston  We wanted some breakfast tacos before we hit the road and I had this place saved to my list of food places to try  We re from Houston so we have a lot of good taco trucks down there but this is the first I ve ever seen that had five stars so I had to try it  I ordered the shrimp taco and the Machaca taco which were both suggested to me by the lady helping us since it was our first time she recommended the shrimp since I like shrimp and I wanted a steak egg and cheese taco which was pretty similar to the machaca taco so she recommended I try that one as well. My boyfriend ordered 2 chicken tacos. The shrimp taco was to die for it was so good and the shrimp were huge usually with shrimp tacos they don t give you enough protein but they definitely made sure you would be for field with this taco I wish I ordered two it was so good I almost wanted to turn it back around but we had somewhere to be by a certain time  My boyfriend loved his chicken tacos which he didn t get to eat until we got back to Houston they were still good we just reheat them in the air fryer and it was magnificent  Anytime I go to Austin I have to stop at this taco truck now highly recommend the ingredients were so fresh and veggies crisp I ve never had tacos to where the vegetables just melt in your mouth with the protein so even if you re not a veggie lover please get the veggies on it because you don t even notice they re vegetables so flavorful and the salsas add just the right amount of spice depending on your liking. They have plenty of vegetarian and or vegan options as well
Granny's Tacos,40,I have to say it again.  Where would I drive 35 minutes on Sunday morning for a taco   Granny s. Migas and Rico never disappoint.  I ll try other places during the week  but Granny gets me on Sunday.
Granny's Tacos,41,Just no. Don t do it. First  VERY SALTY. lacking flavor and just tasting salt. I am sorry to say  this is the worst taco I had during my seven day trip to Austin  and I ate an embarrassingly amount of tacos .   I had the mole taco and shrimp tacos. Shrimp tasted rotten and I had to send back. It was also strange that the shrimp was not even cut up but thank goodness because maybe I would not have been able to identify that it was not a good piece.  The person behind the counter asked what was wrong - and I tried to whisper my experience to not tell everyone around. I ordered a chicken taco that was better than the mole chicken taco. The person behind the counter replaced it quickly.   Each taco is wrapped in aluminum and because it s so hot  it makes it very soggy even for just a minute. I was not asked if I wanted a corn or flour tortilla  and read to ask for the corn if you are familiar. The tacos are really messy when they are opened and should probably not serve this unless asked for this.   My love ordered the chicken burrito and everything was able to fall out easily. It was definitely wrapped incorrectly.   We ordered and paid for a Coca Cola and five minutes later told they were sold out and we were able to opt for water. Honestly  I don t like that. We ordered something  you either have it or you don t and just refund the money first. This seems to be a trend.   The tortilla chips were good and guacamole ok.
Granny's Tacos,42,Granny knows how to make some good freakin  tacos  Stumbling upon this taco truck on a hungover Sunday morning might be the best thing that happened to me during my visit to Austin. Plenty of picnic table seating available and tons of options on the menu. My taco was super flavorful and bigger than I expected. If the line hadn t been so long  I would ve hopped back in for about 50 more of them 
Granny's Tacos,43,Unpopular opinion...Granny s did not live up to the hype. I live nearby and always noticed the long line so I was eager to finally try Granny s Tacos but was honestly let down. My boyfriend and I tried a few of the breakfast tacos. He didn t mind them but mine had an overwhelming taste of onion  however  I ordered a bacon  egg  and cheese taco that didn t have onion on it at all. It s a food truck  so I m sure there s lots of overlap with cooking surfaces but I just couldn t get over that onion-y taste. Also  there were crows literally everywhere because the trash was overflowing so not the most welcoming eating environment.   COVID Precautions  It s outdoors  so minimal. Nobody was really wearing masks or enforcing social distancing.
Granny's Tacos,44,I ve been heartbroken by Granny s for the last time  I went 2x when I first moved to Austin and LOVED it. The breakfast tacos and thick greasy chips and guac were amazing. If anybody visiting Austin asked for food recommendations  Granny s would be on the list.  In the  like  5x I ve gone since  the tacos have just not been good  sloppy  sometimes undercooked  sometimes overcooked  and they  never  have chips and guac. They are also always out of drinks.  We started going to other breakfast taco trucks instead.
Granny's Tacos,45,As a vegetarian I am always eager to find a GOOD taco truck that doesn t skimp on the flavor if you don t eat meat. I noticed this spot on a walk down 6th and loved the sweet service from the employees. I came for lunch and was not disappointed. I ordered two tacos which  with white flour tortillas grilled to a crisp  were more then enough. The Chicagoan in me was expecting corn tortillas. The mole was outstanding and I loved the layers of flavors nuanced in each bite. The veggie taco was a solid bite as well  although I could have done without the big chunks of soft potatoes. At a fair pricepoint however I could see how this spot would quickly be my go-to if I lived here. Will definitely come back.
Granny's Tacos,46,Oh man this truck was the perfect spot to end our trip to Austin  We have killer tacos and I would eat every day if I could. Breakfast tacos included   cactus  egg and cheese Chicken mole Chilaquiles Marinated pork with avocado  amp  pico  I couldn t have asked for a tasty send off
Granny's Tacos,47,Yep  those 5 star reviews are right on the money. These tacos are fantastic  I ordered an al pastor and an abuela taco. Both were good but the simple al pastor with pico was my  1. The meat was perfectly tender and well seasoned in both. I like al pastor seasoning a tad more than adobo  but would definitely order both again.  The tortillas were fresh  soft  and had some elasticity to them. No booze here  FYI. Enjoy your meal with plenty of napkins on their umbrella covered picnic tables or take it to go.   The gentlemen working were kind and helpful. Service was just perfect so you knew your order was made fresh. Definitely a winner.
Granny's Tacos,48,This place is amazing. They truly might serve the best tacos I ve ever had. We got there on the earlier side of lunch on a weekday so there wasn t much of a line or wait.    We Ate  - Apple Soda - Delicious  tbh it s better than coke - Topo Chico - I m white  of course I love this - Chips  amp  Salsa - Chips were super crispy and still a little warm so you know they re good - Al Pastor Quesadilla - A tiny bit greasy but really flavorful - Veggie Taco w. Egg - Needs salsa but otherwise great and filling  - Chilaquil Taco w. Mole - Tied for the other chilaquiles taco for being one of the best tacos I ve ever put in my mouth - Chilaquil Taco w. Verde - Insane. You have to get this.   I legitimately cannot wait to come back here and will dream about their tacos until I do.
Granny's Tacos,49,We came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast. We arrived around 9 30 in the morning  and seem to have beat most of the rush. We ordered five tacos in total  with three of them having corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.  We honestly couldn t tell you what four of the five tacos were  but the one that stood out to me was actually the one that I customized myself. Highly recommend ordering a  pick two  taco with chorizo  eggs  and potato. Douse it with some hot sauce  and you ll be a happy camper  We would definitely love to come back.
Granny's Tacos,50,Delicious food  It s a small food truck but I always say it s not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of fight in the dog and granny s tacos has got a lot of fight   Delicious tacos and quesadillas  I loved the ranchero and the shrimp taco and the chicken quesadilla was delicious  Also don t forget to check in because you ll get a free order of street tacos     Overall  4.65
Granny's Tacos,51,OMG  Wow  What a find   So this is one of Austin s many taco trucks and it doesn t disappoint. We went for breakfast. I ordered two tacos but maybe should have stopped at one. The Manchaca and Migas are the BOMB  OMG  They have picnic tables for outdoor seating. It was a little hard to find but Soo worth it.
Granny's Tacos,52,Pretty much the best street tacos I ve had in a long time.  This place is really hard to find if you re not from around here  so be aware that there are actually talked behind another store. Plenty of other reviewer s have commented on how to find them so I won t repeat the details here.  I was impressed when I placed my order that the tacos actually took a few minutes to come out  which told me they were being made fresh on the spot.  When I took my first bite I know my instincts were correct. Fresh soft tortillas  piping hot meat  and perfect accoutrements.  The seating was pleasant and enabled me to enjoy my meal in comfort.  Two tacos came to less than  10 and for food of this quality it was definitely worth it.  I have no idea if I ll ever come back  as I m from out of town  but I d sure love to 
Granny's Tacos,53,Tacos were great. The line moved fast and food came out quickly in case you go and it is busy. Highly recommend getting the homemade corn tortillas.
Granny's Tacos,54,There are taco trucks and then there s AMAZING TACO trucks. We went to try their meat tacos  shrimp quesadillas  and chips  amp  guacamole. For drinks  we splurged on a mandarin Jarrito and a Manzana Sidrat  apple .   Each of the meat tacos  marinated steak  chicken  or pork al pastor  had double corn tortillas with cilantro and diced onions. The first bite was like a free trip to Mexico  maybe a marketplace in Nuevo Leon  or your granny s house in the valley. This ain t your Tex-Mex. This is the real deal.  We tried the green salsa  mild   the red  medium hot  and roasted red  medium . The giant shrimp in the quesadilla were a meal on their own. The quesadilla was three very cheesy pieces full of red bell peppers  sauteed onions  and other items with the giant shrimp. They were served with some lettuce  diced tomato  and sour cream on the side. Ok  so there is cheese and sour cream  but your abuela might like it. We made ourselves save it for another day and it was still delish.  Everything came with sliced limes. The chips were thicker than your normal store bought fare  with a satisfying crunch and no greasiness.   In all  we would love to come back here and try everything on the menu.
Granny's Tacos,55,The Al Pastor taco is TO DIE FOR    Honestly  I haven t had a good taco in a long time and this was the best I have ever had. The chilaquiles mole taco was not my favorite but the AL PASTOR made up for it. I was so juicy and flavorful and the tenderness of the meat was absolutely amazing. Service was great and fast. I highly recommend to get these tacos  I will be coming back for them Al Pastor Tacos
Granny's Tacos,56,My granny was big on homemade ranch so I didn t grow up with tacos like this and let me tell you  as much as I love creamy buttermilk ranch  I would have traded it in an instant for one of Austin s top rated spots   From breakfast to lunch  you honestly can t go wrong. I d say the size is kind of perfect...you could have one and be tied over until a more sizable meal presents itself or order a few and walk away completely satisfied but not bogged down for a few hours.  I liked the pastor and pollo but I LOVED my chorizo  egg  potato  and cheese   In case you re not in the know...food truck in an alley between 7th and 6th  across-ish from Austin Body Works. There are a few lightly covered picnic tables to enjoy them on the spot but I m pretty sure most people get them to-go  though  I m guessing they become car tacos because there s no way you could handle that delightful smell to wait until you got home 
Granny's Tacos,57,Oh boy  What a find. Wait was a little long  but it was a Saturday mid-day in August so no surprise there.   No buzzers or text notifications so don t go too far. There are a few shops and places to look around while you wait. It was about 20 mins for a couple of tacos. They ll hold the bag until you re back.   There are a few picnic tables and the crowd does clear out quickly. Not too much lingering so you don t have to wait too long for a seat.   The green salsa is yummy. I had the Migas taco  a chicken tinga  I think  and an al pastor. All great.
Granny's Tacos,58,RUN DONT WALK  We just spent the past weekend in Austin and I randomly stumbled upon this taco truck on our first morning in town. We ordered three tacos to split between my friend and I and that was enough to be satisfied. We ordered a migas  red chilaquil and alambre the first time and all were ridiculously good. The stand out star was the migas taco.   Over the course of our trip we tried another  very well known   award winning  taco truck with store outposts around the city and we had high hopes. Nevertheless granny s blew them out of the water for a fraction of the price. The tacos here are filling and well worth your money. We loved them so much that we actually returned as our last meal of our trip . This time my friend and I each got two tacos  and we were stuffed   All of them were out of this world. Do not miss granny s on tour next breakfast taco craving. obsessed.
Granny's Tacos,59,3 Mexicans and a Filipino go to a taco stand  and we leave full but with mixed feelings. This place has great service and a friendly staff. If you speak Spanish I suggest a conversation with granny. She is a delight.   Unfortunately  this taco truck failed in one of the most important parts of the taco  you guessed it  the tortilla. It tasted store bought which lowers the quality of the taco to the point that you need to use the salsa to mask the flavor.   That being said the tacos were still good. My main suggestion is order either the breakfast tacos  the abuelita or the shrimp but don t forget the salsa it helps.   I would normally review this lower because of the tortilla quality but I can feel abuelitas chancla slap me across the head if I reviews this any lower.
Granny's Tacos,60,I never liked Mexican food because of its salty  greasy  cheesy and carby taste. But my ignorance got all overturned today at Granny s Taco.  I enjoyed my very first Gringa and steak taco  minus the taco shell .   People working in the truck was genuinely sweet too  which doubled our enjoyment and enriched my son s impression of Austin on his 3-day spring break.
Granny's Tacos,61,The line was a little long on a Sunday morning after church  but it moved really fast. This is the best taco food truck I ve been to. I ordered the shrimp and abuela tacos  which were amazing. I liked the shrimp the most. I was surprised two tacos left me uncomfortably full because they don t look that big but are very filling. Parking is along the street.
Granny's Tacos,62,Yum     Tex mex tacos at its best. We came here for breakfast tacos and granny s did not disappoint. Although the breakfast tacos were BOMB  what stole my heart was the picadillo taco. Removing one star because the wait is soooo long  good things comes to those who wait  .  Also keep in mind these are TEXAS sized tacos and are MASSIVE. One taco can be a whole meal for someone with a small appetite.
Granny's Tacos,63,Decent tacos  but no Cuantos Tacos. Seems to have achieved notoriety through word of mouth and there were several convention-going visitors there.  But  while Granny s is a 5 on a 1-11 scale  I would put Cuantos at a pure  11.  Now  the Granny s tend to be larger than Cuantos  so they have that going for them.
Granny's Tacos,64,Updating my original review   I ordered a shrimp taco today and it was very good. Unfortunately  I asked for a corn tortilla  but was still given flour. Nevertheless  the flavor was great and they were generous with the shrimp.  Previously  I d only had their breakfast tacos  which pale in comparison to the taco I enjoyed today.
Granny's Tacos,65,Been dying to try this place for so long and finally made it before they closed  which is at 3pm everyday .  Asked the guy working what the most popular tacos was so went with his recommendations of an Abuela  Picadillo and a chorizo egg and cheese because I can t try a new taco place without trying a chorizo egg and cheese. This is my way of truly comparing them and honestly just judging them bc they better have a damn good chorizo egg and cheese for me to come back. And these guys did.  The abuela was delicious and very different than the usual tacos I ve had so would definitely recommend this.  The Picadillo was kinda bland without the sauce they provide you so once I drenched it in that spicy chipotle type sauce it was so good.  I can t wait to come back here and try out a bunch of others. Honestly you get a lot in your taco for the price - worth it  
Granny's Tacos,66,i got the birria tacos and they were super good. i was visiting from oklahoma city to go to a concert at the moody center and this was one of the closest taco trucks near the Hotel Van Zandt that was open at 10am. loved it thought it was great and the meat was so tender and the consome was smack. The lady who helped me out was great and the food got out pretty quick for how busy it was when we got there. My only complaint is parking but that s Austin for ya. will def go again whenever im visiting austin 
Granny's Tacos,67,Delicious tacos made with care  The Birria taco is ut of this world and comes with the best sauce.. you could drink it.
Granny's Tacos,68,I was so excited to try out Granny s  but unfortunately was very disappointed. I ordered the Abuela and Shrimp tacos   4.25 each   which I consider to be slightly on the pricier end for their size even though they were pretty filling tacos.   As I was eating my Shrimp taco  I noticed that the piece of shrimp I was chewing didn t have the right texture and when I looked at it closely  I could see it was still raw. Then I checked the other pieces of shrimp and they weren t fully cooked through. Needless to say  I couldn t eat any of the shrimp and because of the piece of shrimp I did eat  my stomach was quite upset the following day. Even if the shrimp had been fully cooked  I think the amount of the sauce on the taco was overkill and it was pretty drenched. And the Abuela taco did not make up for it - it was very salty. I sadly cannot recommend this place.
Granny's Tacos,69,Had the chilaquil taco with mole on flour tortilla and apple soda and it was a wonderful afternoon treat  The jalape o is pretty spicy so asked for it without if you are sensitive to spice. Locals and the staff recommend flour tortilla over the corn 
Granny's Tacos,70,This has to be one of my favorite  if not my favorite  taco spots in Austin  I love their quesadillas and tacos plus it s around all the great bars on the east side.
Granny's Tacos,71,This is the original location and has a nice seating area. The wait is a little bit longer  so I prefer their new location that has more convenient parking and quicker service.   Their tacos are absolutely the best in town 
Granny's Tacos,72,Fantastic taco place with great sauces to compliment them. The breakfast tacos were one of my fave in Austin. Would go again 
Granny's Tacos,73,Oh my god  This place has one of the best tacos I have ever had in my life. It was sooooo good I barely held myself back from ordering more tacos  The tacos were perfectly seasoned with great sauces and flavor. This place is going in my list and I will be back whenever possible. It s a little expensive for a food truck but I can understand  I would happily pay 10  for two tacos from this place everyday. Also  nice atmosphere with nice seating and decorations. Note  you do have to pay for parking most of the time  2  per car for 2 hrs .
Granny's Tacos,74,Disclaimer  I m a picky taco eater and I honestly don t even like tacos that much.  HOWEVER  these are some of the best tacos I ve had. I wasn t expecting much  I ve had my fair share of trailer tacos and they re ok for the most part. I ordered the migas  abuela  and alhambre. To be honest  I don t know what taco is in the picture but it s either the abuela or alhambre and it was AMAZING. The meat is so flavorful  the avocado is so fresh and the salsas are so well made. One of them has such a smoky flavor  I was so impressed when I took a bite.  Would highly recommend coming here for some big tacos  10 10  I ll be back 
Granny's Tacos,75,I was recommended this place from a friend. He was ranting and raving so I was like let me give them a try. I am very glad I did. The food is simply amazing. Kind of hard to find As they re  on a side street. The customer service is really good as well.  Food  I got three tacos but only ate two. The tacos here are huge. Extremely big. You definitely get your moneys worth here. They don t skimp you  like other restaurants. Their tacos are fully loaded and straight up amazing. The chilaquiles was very tasty  Lots of flavor. The pork taco was so good too. The third taco that I didn t get to eat was the abuela. All of the ingredients are super fresh and good. Everything is made to perfection. Everything is cooked fresh. I literally have all good things to say about this place. I would definitely suggest giving them a try if you re in the area. The green sauce is so good. There s probably some of the best green sauce I ve had in a long time. It s very very spicy and very good.  Customer service  Rey is doing a great job here. He is extremely personable and knows how to talk to clients. He made the great recommendations and I was happy he did because they were so good. Rey is doing an exceptional job here at grannies Taco. He was doing such a good job I wonder if he is part owner or son of the family. Because he truly cares about his job and he is doing a really good job so grannies tacos if you re reading this make sure you guys recognize a job he is doing.  I will definitely come back
Granny's Tacos,76,Granny s has delicious migas tacos plus variations of  and other tacos like chilaquiles and street tacos . My favorite is the Machaca which is basically a migas taco with steak. Whoa.  The portions are generous and  although a taco will run you around  3.50  you ll be happy with how hefty it is.  My one gripe is that they aren t the fastest. Expect to wait 10-15 minutes for your order if nobody else is in line. Expect to wait 25  minutes for your order if it s busy  which it usually is .
Granny's Tacos,77,Muy delicioso   These tacos were seasoned well  They were very delicious  Outdoor seating as this is a food truck 
Granny's Tacos,78,These are the best tacos in the world  I would move to Austin from Cali just to eat these tacos every weekend. Soooooo goood 
Granny's Tacos,79,That Abuela Taco is straight life changing. I m born and raised on the east coast  so my experience with tacos is bad. I honestly never really liked tacos because I always found them kinda bland  turns out they just wrap garbage in tortillas on the east coast. The Abuela and Al Pastor tacos punched me in the face with flavor  never had that experience with a taco. We also got a shrimp taco and chicken nachos  both were very good too. This all took about 10-15 minutes for them to prepare while there weren t many customers  though I think that s because of the nachos  people who only got tacos didn t wait too long.
Granny's Tacos,80,Hit this place on a recommendation.  My son had a chorizo and potato as well as the Abuela.  I had a shrimp and a Picadillo.  Some of the best tacos we ever had.  The Abuela is a MUST try 
Granny's Tacos,81,Arguably the best taco truck in Austin. They have incredible variety  lots of diverse options and are family run by the sweetest family.
Granny's Tacos,82,Granny s Tacos is great I had the chance to go there last weekend and it was very good. When it comes to tacos I m not a hard person to please. At the same instance the service and also the tacos that I have had they re   amazing. For anyone that love street tacos I highly recommend.
Granny's Tacos,83,SO DELICIOUS   My friend and I  trusted the 5 stars on Yelp and decided to pay Granny s a visit.   I ordered the spinach amp egg and migas breakfast tacos with their green sauce. It was absolutely delicious. There really are no words. Just two of their tacos will fill you up  because they are so generous with the fillings   I definitely recommend checking this place out. They are absolutely deserving of all the high ratings - it is such a hidden gem 
Granny's Tacos,84,One of the best taco spots in Austin. I came here in the summer and it was hot enough outside to scorch an armadillo. The line was long  but the tacos were worth it. I had the Picadillo steak tacos. They had steak  bell pepper  potato  avocado  and cheese- really tasty. The menu is extensive with breakfast tacos  bowls  burritos  tortas  nachos  and more. I will be back soon.
Granny's Tacos,85,I can t believe how much I didn t want to try a food truck and apparently we had the best food here.  My friend recommended it she tried it before and I checked it out it s actually a five star on yelp.  Probably that s why I felt comfortable trying it.  I figured it if we go super early then we could actually breathe and have a decent breakfast and that s what happened.  We got a chicken quesadilla and a breakfast taco with potatoes chorizo and cheese.  Everything was very tasty super delicious the Food took an average time to be ready   we saw a lot of people who were just taking out.  They don t have coffee but they have a coffee shop  close by so we went to get coffee there.  Crew is nice  They like to write cute notes on our to go bags     We left happy  stuffed and I would actually come back.
Granny's Tacos,86,Best tacos I ve ever had  A tucked away food truck that s doing it right.   I ve gotten the al pastor tacos and they re juicy  but not greasy. They really pack on the taco fillings  which makes the price worth it.   My fianc  and I went to place a large order and it took 40 minutes and they didn t label the tacos  so that s why the 4 stars. Also  there are tons of flies around while you re eating.  Otherwise  it s a great spot for lunch sitting at one of the picnic tables or to take with you 
Granny's Tacos,87,Taco was soggy..too much liquid and got sick immediately after eating. Maybe I need to try the other location but this one not good.
Granny's Tacos,88, Yes you really need to go here   My boyfriend and I popped by for a quick breakfast and man these tacos did not disappoint. Tacos are generously portioned  reasonably priced and all-around a great meal. The tacos taste authentic  especially the bean and egg one since I grew up with my grandma making a similar one . Seating is well-spaced for COVID times and becomes available very quickly.
Granny's Tacos,89,Delicious   Great little food truck with shaded picnic seating - a great find while passing through Austin  My husband and I tried multiple tacos to share. A long wait but sooo worth it. We ordered the abuela  the campechano and the machaca.  All 3 were excellent but we had to order another machaca because it was that good      Be sure to request the salsas that come with it. The green was sublime  
Granny's Tacos,90,My favorite Mexican place in Austin so far  Had the Rico  not pictured  -mole  which was the perfect combo of soft rice  and sweet and spicy mole.  The chicken quesadilla was my favorite at this place. It has everything you d want  cilantro  onions  big chunks of chicken  lots of cheese  on a soft tortilla which I think is homemade.  The chicken taco exceptionally good for a chicken taco. Seemed like all dark meat and altogether a lot of filling.  Also tasted the mole chicken chilaquiles taco which was good  a little too carby for me. But the mole sauce at this place is great 
Granny's Tacos,91,Had to try this place after hearing so many good things. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I think the tacos are a little overhyped. I got the migas and picadillo tacos  and thought they were good but nothing spectacular. I do appreciate the portion size though - you get a lot of filling for a good price. They also came out piping hot and quickly. I hope to come back and try some different tacos.
Granny's Tacos,92,Great food  Best breakfast taco ever. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good local vendor that is not your typical restauranteur. Not to mention friendly taff
Granny's Tacos,93,Delicious tacos and great  quick service    We decided to stop and get some Granny s Tacos for a late breakfast before a long Saturday. We we very happy  I got the beans  eggs and cheese  delicious   and my boyfriend got the chorizo  egg and cheese as well as abuela taco. He enjoyed both   We will definitely be back next time we re in Austin 
Granny's Tacos,94,We had the mole  chilaquiles and chorizo  amp  egg tacos. All of them were delicious  Red sauce is spicy and tasty. Night recommend stopping here
Granny's Tacos,95,Amazing tacos    Granny s is a good truck  you line up  order  take a seat and wait maybe 5 mins and then it s taco time   The Picadillo is really good  as is the Rico.  Everything on the menu looks good and there are lots of options  maybe 10 different taco options  and they also have other food  but most people seem to be ordering tacos.  There is about 4 large outdoor tables  umbrellas  and people seem ok to have others join their table  sitting at opposite end .  Delicious. Highly recommend 
Granny's Tacos,96,Solid Austin breakfast tacos. I d suggest you make your own from the ingredient list. 3 tacos is a good amount. 2 might do it for a lighter meal. Good coffee next door.
Granny's Tacos,97,Tacos were delicious  Remember to request corn tortillas on your tacos  I believe the default is flour. My friends and I forgot at first  but thankfully I remembered pretty soon after ordering  and they were able to make them on corn instead.   The tacos themselves were full of flavor  juicy  and overall really delicious. I also loved the crunchiness and freshness of their flour tortillas  and the guacamole was fantastic. The food truck is near some picnic tables  and there was plenty of open seating. The guy taking our order was also very nice. Overall a great taco food truck 
Granny's Tacos,98,I came here for the first time and it instantly became one of my favorite taco places in Austin. The prices are great for the heaping portion sizes. I typically need at least 3 tacos to feel full  but Granny s had me getting full after 1.5. I got the Abuela taco and the shrimp taco. Both were juicy and full of flavor. Just make sure to get here earlier in the afternoon as they ran out of chicken and chips by the time I ate. The wait time for food can be up to 30min  but it was definitely worth it and I can see why they re so popular.
Granny's Tacos,99,Overall  The Red Sauce Taco is amazing     First of all I love being able to order my food through this app. The red sauce taco is delicious it has chilaquiles which give it a little crunch then they add the granny s sour cream and it just makes it delish. It is pretty filling and two was enough for me. Add a coke and it makes the tacos even better.
Granny's Tacos,100,Looove this place sooo much  Their tacos are so good. My go-to taco is the migas and abuela taco on corn tortilla. It can definitely get busy if you go on the weekends  but it is worth the wait 
Granny's Tacos,101,Aaaaalright  lowkey I m the type of person that can t tell one taco place from the next but I gotta say Granny s knows how to cook and season their meat and stuff their tacos to the BUH-RIM. Usually I feel like I need to eat 5 tacos from other places to feel full but Granny s got me full in two. Sadly  they are so popular that I got antsy dining in even though it was outdoors seating. Also they ran out of chicken and chips whilest I was ordering so I couldn t try one of the tacos I was super interested in - the Rico buuuut  that means I ll just be coming back again    
Granny's Tacos,102,The best breakfast tacos you ll ever encounter. Be careful with the fresh jalape os cuz they are HOT  Chorizo  bean and egg tacos were spectacular. No other words.
Granny's Tacos,103,Yes the tacos could be less salty but they were delish and the people are very polite  I got make my own breakfast tacos
Granny's Tacos,104,I just moved to Austin and was recommended this place from multiple people. It did not disappoint  My friend and I started with the salsa and chips which was delicious. The salsa was nice and spicy but not unbearable with tons of flavor. It s obvious the chips are freshly made and they were easily some of my favorite. Then we shared the Alambre and shrimp taco and both made great impressions. They were filled with sauce with such great flavor combinations  we were upset we shared. If you are looking for some amazing tacos at a reasonable price  I would definitely recommend stopping here.
Granny's Tacos,105,My favorite Saturday morning breakfast taco is now open late. Tastes like home made every time. I live the Rico taco  gringa  and the steak taco. They raised the prices a little bit  but still a really good value.
Granny's Tacos,106,Best tacos     A must go if in Austin  You won t be disappointed. Now one of my favorite places.  Everything is phenomenal 
Granny's Tacos,107,The food was absolutely amazing and staff was super helpful. We weren t sure what to get but they were super nice and helped us figure out what we wanted to eat. The shrimp tacos were super good and so was the alambre taco. They have shaded benches for outdoor seating. Also they deserve their rating for top 100 restaurants in texas.
Granny's Tacos,108,This spot is located in a quiet area of Austin. The prices were so reasonable  and the food came out very fresh  The sauces were the real winners as they enhanced the flavor a ton. Breakfast tacos are a must  choose whichever because they are all slam dunks 
Granny's Tacos,109,Soon heaven will open up and cast a  golden light upon this taco truck. If it hasnt happened yet  get your gold  frankincense and myrrh ready. You will want to make the journey and pay your respects at this holy place.  I m always a little skeptical of places that have 5 full star reviews. People get caught up in the hype and rave about a place because its already been designated as a great place. Well  believe these reviews. Grannys is outstanding. Yes  you will likely wait a little while  but it s so worth it. I am not exaggerating to say these are some of the very best  if not best  tacos Ive ever had.  Everything I ate was delicious  but the Ranchero taco almost made me cry it was so good. I seriously dont know what magic they use to make eggs  pico  cheese  avocado and chicarron taste so amazing but it works. The 3 tacos I chose were straight off of recommendations of the owners. Obviously   they didn t steer me wrong.  Make sure you also try the different salsas. They are completely unnecessary but also delicious.   Go now 
Granny's Tacos,110,2nd best migas tacos in town. The shrimp tacos are amazing too. Don t forget to ask for the salsa.  The taco truck feels verg authentic and the people who run it are down to earth. Worth every penny. Xooked well  packed to the rim  and loaded with flavor in every bite.
Granny's Tacos,111,Granny s is okay  there really wasn t anything extraordinary about it here. Tacos were overpriced with unique names. Unfortunately they did not live up to the hype. It s good just not great.
Granny's Tacos,112,Granny s taco s are strong contenders in the Austin breakfast taco scene. High quality ingredients and quite a large portion. I recommend the Moga s and the Bacon Egg and Cheese.
Granny's Tacos,113,My go to taco food truck. Filling and tasty. Love this place and they have two locations.  Sometime they won t pick up the phone to place and order  so you ll have to do it their.
Granny's Tacos,114,They need to update their hours and location on the map as they were closed when we got there and impossible to find
Granny's Tacos,115,Tacos are good.  I mean Ive nevet reallu tasted a bad one.  They are a notch above the rest  My only complaint is their hours seem to be somewhat inconsistent with what s posted.
Granny's Tacos,116,Tacos are okay. I m from Houston  where breakfast tacos are a staple and the chile is a must. Breakfast tacos were not the best  very overly cooked egg and too much seasoning. The chile wasn t the best either  the average you would get at a store. Overall  I think there are better places out there potentially more authentic tacos too. A ton of people love this place  but it just wasn t for me.
Granny's Tacos,117,Very delicious tacos  The tacos are a very filling so I only ate one. The potato  egg and cheese taco was very flavorful. I was surprised at the portion size of the chips and salsa. I was able to comfortably share . The salsa was absolutely delicious and I would definitely order it again  Service was great  food was delicious  the portion size was also good.
Granny's Tacos,118,Solid  solid spot for tacos. I had the chilaquile taco with green sauce. I also had the steak fries because I couldn t help myself. No pictures because neither survived. Sorry about that   The taco was one of the best I ve ever had. The green sauce was fantastic. Just to many awesome flavors in one taco and that little crunch from the crushed tortilla chips was perfect. It was a little heavy on the onions so beware if you re not into that.   The fries were fantastic as well. I did end up sharing these lol. The steak was tender which can always make or break being a topping on fries. The fries were fresh and crispy. The toppings were ample and fresh.   My friend had a torta and it was HUGE  I can t remember which one she got but she loved it.   Price-wise this is a no brainer. It wasn t crazy expensive and the ingredients tasted quality. This spot is a must try 
Granny's Tacos,119,Great     Had a large order for 10 people they knocked it out quick. Salsa is spicy Al Pastor was my favorite
Granny's Tacos,120,Beautiful day for brunch outside...Awesome breakfast tacos from an Interesting menu  We went old school and tried chorizo  egg and cheese along with a  Ranchero.  Both were awesome  One is enough for breakfast. The salsas are all great as are the prices.   Next time we ll be better prepared and opt for something more adventurous from the menu.
Granny's Tacos,121,Just a little taco trailer on the side of the road  but the flavor is amazing. I ve been there several times and had most of their tacos. The tortilla is handmade and the taste of each  guiso  is authentic.  Make sure you re not starving when you go to Granny s because the wait can be long  but it s sooooo worth it
Granny's Tacos,122,While visiting Austin for a week we ended up here on our way to Revival for coffee and I m so glad for their location. My girlfriend and I ordered a couple breakfast tacos  Eggs   bacon  and a red and green chilaquil taco. Everything was fantastic. We arrived not long before they were closing and when I noticed they were packing up and on their way out I had to stop what I was doing and let them know how damn good everything was.  We were served by Liz and she was great. No idea when I ll ever be back in Austin but I ll definitely make it by again and try more from the menu.  If I was going to critique anything  I could use a touch more bacon in the breakfast taco. Everything was so good that I wanted the last bite to be perfect  but hey. No biggie.  If you re choosing between Granny s and somewhere else  just stop by Granny s. Especially for the chilaquil tacos.  And... if you want some great coffee with great aesthetics  hop by Revival after 
Granny's Tacos,123,I ate breakfast here after grabbing a delicious iced coffee from Revival. I ordered the Migas and Abuela taco..both very savory. I liked the salsas here..the best I ve had so far  
Granny's Tacos,124,The absolute best taco truck in town. It may be proximity  but for my money  this place can t be beat. Based on the crowd during lunch time  I m not alone.   Tortas here are enormous and a sight to behold. I know Austin is a breakfast taco town  but the breakfast burrito here is amazing. I ve had almost everything here  and haven t been disappointed. If I had one complaint  it s that they sometimes run out of their spicy salsa  sooo good  I can t get enough of it  
Granny's Tacos,125,I live less than three blocks away  and Granny s became one of my go-tos for takeout during the pandemic. That said  I m a bit taken aback to see this place with a solid five-star rating on here. Granny s is good  but not  that  good  and for the most part its menu is par for the course for Austin Tex-Mex.  It s still well-priced  however  despite its recent price increases on most of the menu  and to be fair it has a few items I ve rarely  if ever  seen elsewhere in town  e.g. mole tacos  the Rico . The Abuela is arguably the best bet  but I m not entirely sure about the raves for their migas tacos  on the east side alone I can name a half-dozen places with superior options  though I m admittedly an Austin OG  almost  but not quite  a native .
Granny's Tacos,126,My goodness are the tacos good  I m from SoCal so I would like to consider myself pretty good at deterring a delicious taco. They use flour tortillas which I was surprised about but they are yummy    We came after Revival coffee and just wanted to try some after hearing the hype. We got the Abuela and the ranchero and both were amazing  I preferred the Abuela for the delicious meat but my boyfriend liked the crunch of the Ranchero more   It was kinda busy when we got there  short line but a lot of people waiting. Took around 10-15 minutes for the order to come out. The tacos are the size of small burritos so they are quite filling   We will ba back to try more of their food soon   
Granny's Tacos,127,Finding a good taco in Texas isn t hard  but finding a great taco is another story. It was love at first bite  I have to admit we ordered more than just breakfast tacos. We also had a couple of pastor tacos. Flavorful and well made. What I mean by that  they are not weak on the filling. They also make it easy for pick up. Order on line  and your order will be ready for pick up in about a half and hour. Fabulous spot to hit while your in town.
Granny's Tacos,128,This is supposed to be one of Austin s best and it did not disappoint. A little hidden but with good outside space. I had the special  Birria  which was exceptional  but the steak taco was excellent as were the shrimp tacos. Subtle salsas and spicing throughout made this a delicious lunch 
Granny's Tacos,129,Great flavors  friendly service  and just good ole food  Definitely worth the stop if you re in the neighborhood.
Granny's Tacos,130,These tacos hit the spot. I got one chicken and one steak. All of the ingredients are fresh and you can tell the meat has been marinaded.   I wasn t able to spot Granny in the truck  but I definitely recommend.
Granny's Tacos,131,Went several weekends ago. They were out of the birria tacos so I ordered something else. It was still good and my buddies liked their tacos as well.  I enjoyed my tacos at the time but if I were in the mood for tacos again I d likely try elsewhere and fallback here for a safe pick if I had to.
Granny's Tacos,132,I have never tasted tacos as good as Granny s Tacos. They were amazing and I truly wish that we had them available in Florida.   The food truck was very clean and orderly. The small patio area was shaded by umbrellas and a big tree. I loved the music playing and appreciated the outstanding customer service.   I ordered three tacos to share with my husband. Each taco was made to order and was served steaming hot. All three were perfect and I would order any of them again. The al Pastor was my top favorite and the Rancheros Taco was my husbands.
Granny's Tacos,133,This tucked away taco stand is the best thing I got out of my last relationship  Seriously  great tacos. I ve never had a bad bite here. Perfect food truck vibe for east Austin. Great location for grabbing a bite and walking around the east side 
Granny's Tacos,134,Great tacos  can t go wrong with any. Had the breakfast tacos and a friend tried a few others. Everything is good.
Granny's Tacos,135,Tacos are always good but my favorite is a chorizo breakfast burrito after a long bike ride.
Granny's Tacos,136,New favorite taco spot. I get a little hesitant over veggie tacos because they can be underwhelming  but these were amazing. I opted for beans instead of eggs but I m sure the eggs would have been great too.
Granny's Tacos,137,Got the veggie taco with beans and it was AMAZING  1 taco filled me up and it was such a great price. Location was smaller compared to others but it was nice that Revival was also near by and I could stop there after. Definitely will be coming back.
Granny's Tacos,138,Believe the hype  I ve tried many great taco places since moving to Austin 4 months ago  and this place is up there with the best. I ve gone here 4 or 5 times now  and everything I ve tried has been out of this world delicious. I usually prefer flour tortillas  but highly recommend that you request corn when ordering at Granny s. They are homemade and outstanding. My favorites are the ranchero taco and the chilaquil taco. The chilaquil taco is one of the single best food items I ve had so far in Austin. So much umami. Eyes rolling to the back of the head delicious  In general  there is something really unique about the food here. It s authentic  but they also have their own style that stands out from the crowd.  On top of the great food  the staff is super friendly  If you re in East Austin make sure you stop by.
Granny's Tacos,139,They messed up one of my orders  but it was a crazy busy day and the tacos were good.
Granny's Tacos,140,Most worth it tacos     I love tacos  and I m a pretty regular taco eater too. By no means am I an expert  but Granny s has scrumptious  good portioned tacos for a very decent price. I got the Migas   3  and Alambre Tacos   3.50  and felt full   So I d recommend two tacos if you usually eat normal portions and three tacos if you re a guy or a big eater.  It was my first time  and I just looked at reviews to pick my order. I would say Migas is a must though  My friend and I ordered Migas  and we both loved it.
Granny's Tacos,141,Ok  the tacos here are AMAZING     All the reviews are right   I came here to grab tacos to go on my day off after a pedicure down the street.  It was Monday during lunch and the wait was about 35 minutes.  Since revival coffee next door was closed  I walked to coffee traders a few blocks down to grab coffee and kill time.  By the time I came back  my order was ready.  I got the Migas  abuela and the picadello.  All three were amazing   The portions were huge considering they were about  3 each.  The homemade tortillas were amazing     I know I used the word amazing several times in this review but I just can t think of another word to describe this place.  If you re looking for a great taco place and have time to spare  this is the perfect spot for you 
Granny's Tacos,142,Taco Tuesday  Taco Sunday  Tacos everyday  This is my new go-to taco spot. Grabbed a few tacos today AND loved every bite. Mmm mmm mmm. The only downfall was the wait - who can blame them though  Delicious taco truck   typically a decent wait time. Anyways  if you re thinking about grabbing a taco - you will be more than satisfied. Oh ya  the tacos are a pretty good size - I went with 3 and was full by the second one. I highly recommend the ranchero and picadillo taco. Enjoy 
Granny's Tacos,143,So this morning my gf and I both had a craving for tacos. You know how it goes. Not only did we satisfy our craving  we also found amazing service. Let s get straight to it.  The Nitty Gritty So  you know how some places try and serve a salad on a tortilla  Not here. They know how to portion a taco so that you can hold it and eat it without looking like a wierdo. I ordered two breakfast tacos with egg  sausage  cheese and spinach. The order didn t take long and the guy who took our order was really kind and had great manners. His hand was wrapped in a bandage  he either got a gnarly tattoo  or really burned himself and was working through the pain. Your dedication was not lost bro  and I hope you see this Yelp shout out.  The tacos were filling  tasty  well portioned and really helped us kick off a day of exploring the awesome and beautifully weird sights in Austin. They even had a guy who works there who looks like Anthony Bordain  We had a quick laugh about that.  If you fins yourself in Austin with the morning munchies  give this place a try. You will not regret it. They re doing a beautiful job keeping Austin  not only weird  but tasty.
Granny's Tacos,144,This spot is an absolute MUST HAVE if you ever visit Austin. I ordered the Abuela  Campechano  and Steak tacos and they were absolutely delicious. The portion was generous and the price was just unbeatable. My friend ordered the Guac and chips to share with the table and the chips were addicting  thick  crunchy  and not greasy. The guac is super fresh  as well.   I came here for a Saturday dinner and surprisingly  there were still many big and clean picnic tables so you can always go with a big group. There were also many city street parking spots nearby.   The default is flour tortilla so you should specifically ask for corn tortilla.
Granny's Tacos,145,Love their tacos and the salsa is delish   You have to try the shrimp tacos and migas 
Granny's Tacos,146,When I first saw 5 stars for this place on Yelp I was so skeptical but I had to check it out.  Granny s is this little mom and pop food truck on the east side serving up some of the best breakfast tacos in Austin. It s totally unassuming and incredibly underrated. I first went to Granny s a few years ago when I first moved to Austin. I met the owner and asked him to just pick a few things for me to eat.  He chose the nopales breakfast taco and the broccoli breakfast taco.  I was soooo skeptical about the broccoli breakfast taco but holy crap it is SO good. Highly highly recommend trying it at least once.  I also got this vegetable and eggs dish  I forgot what it s called  which was huge and also very tasty.
Granny's Tacos,147,Arguably the best tacos in town - and I ve tried my fair share  from Torchy s  meh  to Cuantos  oh yes  to Granny s. Tortas and bowls are hefty portions  so I usually have leftovers.
Granny's Tacos,148,I had heard about this place a few times  so while in the area I had to stop and give this place a try.   They wouldn t answer the phone when I tried to call for a to go order. When I showed up  I couldn t definitely understand why  Even with all the people there  it probably only took me 15-20 minutes to get my order in.   We tried a few different tacos. Chorizo egg bean cheese  chorizo egg potato cheese  migas cheese  and the Alambre. My favorite was DEFINITELY the alambre taco  My second favorite was the chorizo egg potato cheese taco. These tacos are small  but they LOAD them up with filling. Two will fill up a normal sized human with a basic appetite. Get three if you re a little hangry.   If I lived closer  I would be a regular. These are great breakfast tacos.
Granny's Tacos,149,The pastor was not as good as I had hoped. There wasn t much of a char or texture to the meat. At some points it tasted like manwich meat  which brought to my mind a terrible image of sloppy Joe tacos. Closer to the second half of the taco  there was a flood of pineapples. They were quite refreshing and fruity  even though they were the only thing I could taste once they were there.
Granny's Tacos,150,This place is SUCH good fine  Thanks to yelp   During quarantine my boyfriend and I visited Austin to getaway for our anniversary. We were looking to grab breakfast before heading home and stopped at this food truck and I AM SO GLAD WE DID.   First thing I thought when we got out of the car is wow it smells glorious. Then I was pleaser at the sight- it s very clean  As far as convenience goes  another positive  there is parking right out front  Second of all the guy that helped us was really nice. He said  the corn tortilla will take a bit longer because it s made fresh by hand is that ok  IS THAT OK   MUSIC TO MY EARS.   We both got the campechano Taco  steak  chorizo  pico  amp  avocado  and dear Lord     So bomb  Will definitely be coming back here for breakfast or late night.. or mid day.. quesadillas and tacos next time we re in Austin 
Granny's Tacos,151,Grabbed some tacos as our last stop before we left Austin. It was definitely the best meal we had while in town. I got the cactus breakfast taco and the chorizo potato breakfast taco. Both were awesome. The line was pretty long and it did take about 20 minutes for us to receive our food once we ordered but it was definitely worth it. Four tacos and a drink was 16 dollars which I thought was pretty affordable for the area. Will be back next time I m in town 
Granny's Tacos,152,Would give 500 stars if I could. Had the breakfast taco  and the original  granny s  taco  and both rocked my world. This was the best taco I had during my trip in Austin  and I will definitely be back next time 
Granny's Tacos,153,Was expecting much more since they have a 5 star rating but they were short from high satisfaction. Service is good  location is nice  even though you gotta pay for street parking. Prices are a bit high but Biden is president so   ...but food is good  not great but just good. I see why they have a 5 star as soon as I arrived  it s because of who their customers are. Me being Mexican was not impressed by their food  burrito needs more love...seasoning was a bit off  tacos and chips are extremely greasy. They have a good idea of the food  but not quite there yet
Granny's Tacos,154,Great street taco. So far been one of the best places in Austin thx for Mexican food. Loved it and will def come here when I visit Austin again.  Veggie taco not that good.
Granny's Tacos,155,Abuela  Abuela  Abuela  It was early in the morning  drizzling  low sky  humid  next to cemetery in Austin  but I believed it s what I was looking for because some people think that food next to the cemetery is more delicious than any other  that s why ancient people went on a picnic to graveyards.   Ranchero tacos  Chicharron  egg  avocado  pico cheese  chips  Nahuatl Chilaquiles taco  mole  chicken and sour cream  and Coca-Cola de Mexico.   Even though it was really slow cook as if I was in the lines at the Franklin Bbq  waiting for 30mins for only two tacos  it was worth waiting. A real Abuela cooked best tacos in my life. I used be proud of living in LA where best tacos everywhere in cheap price  but this is gonna be the next chapter in my life.
Granny's Tacos,156,Best tacos  the beef and chorizo on corn was so awesome and seasoned perfectly.  Friendly service and fast 
Granny's Tacos,157,Ordered by phone and the gentleman on the phone was very polite and courteous  They also take payment over the phone which is fine by me and preferred since I m pregnant and can t have a lot of contact with humans at this time. I ordered the La Gringa for lunch and me and my baby were dancing with all of the delicious flavors  It was fresh  hot  bursting with flavor and the verde salsa was spicy but not too spicy which I loved  Pricing was very reasonable and I would definitely come back   BTW  they speak both english AND spanish  I know that I get embarrassed at taco stands sometimes because I m brown and it s always assumed that I speak spanish but I don t  so I am truly grateful for the stands that have an English speaker too 
Granny's Tacos,158,The best taco food truck  in my opinion. All the tacos I got were exceptional. The mole and the machacado are great here.
Granny's Tacos,159,Delicious  We go every time we visit Austin- you can t go wrong with any taco on the menu
Granny's Tacos,160,Great spot for cheap and quick breakfast  Ordered bean and egg taco  2.50 Potato and egg  2.50  Very good value  one taco is enough for a light breakfast .
Granny's Tacos,161,Came here based on reviews. Solid tacos. Thought the sauce was a little overpowering on some of them. The wait is not too bad  and you can walk around the neighborhood while you wait. Benched area to sit  some tables have shade.
Granny's Tacos,162,I was told about how Gr8 the food is   Granny s Tacos so when we arrived in Austin we had to give it a try... I have got to say that I had the Shrimp Quesadilla that was Fantabulous   So treat yourself to some Gr8 food and Relax for a bit to enjoy a really Gr8 meal   Ren Lopez  amp  Joe Alaniz
Granny's Tacos,163,True to the name  but what can get better than an actual abuela making your taco   My husband and I got the abuela and chilaquile tacos... loaded and phenomenal.  No frills  easy street parking  reasonably priced  and the mole sauce is amazing.
Granny's Tacos,164,Literally hands down the best tacos in Austin  Everything on the menu is delicious full of flavor and just perfect. Great customer service 
Granny's Tacos,165,THEY MAKE THEIR TORTILLAS. So I am a big taco fan but I hate store bought tortillas. IMO if you make tacos make the dang tortillas too. This place dose and it s tasty. I love nopales  or cactus for you gringos  very tasty good salsa. They have a nice shady area with canopy tables for seating and in the morning it s very pleasant even in Texas September. I never saw granny but two guys were inside whipping it up. They have cold bottled drinks like jarritos and coke no coffee.   PS there is a coffee shop about 20 paces from the trailer very convenient
Granny's Tacos,166,Chanced upon this gem when we had gone to get some coffee at Revival. I have no words  Where was this place all along and why didn t we try this before. I always complained that I never got to have good tacos after Miami. Granny s Tacos can totally compete with my fabled Miami tacos.   Ordering at this place was also a breeze. Very organised and fast. We tried Abuela  Ranchero and Chorizo tacos and I loved them in that order. Abuela is the crowning jewel. Loved everything about the tacos here. We will surely be back for more    
Granny's Tacos,167,super yummy tacos and a friendly staff  Being from SanAntonio I am a harsh taco critic  but they make the cut  Tacos are good and they have a great variety. During busy times it can take a while to get your tacos so just know that going in. I ve eaten here many times and my favorite is the alambre
Granny's Tacos,168,If I lived in Austin this would be my go to taco truck spot. Absolutely delicious tacos  both big in size and flavor. The shrimp taco was just WOW. Very friendly workers  worth the long food truck wait.
Granny's Tacos,169,Disclaimer      Michelin restaurants and Taco Trucks are in separate rating parameters.     These are the best tacos we have ever had. We tried 7  yes  7 different tacos.   HOLY      these tacos are amazing        No. REALLY     On all levels they are great  Flavor  Ingredients  Creativity  Filling  Damn tasty       Go today    
Granny's Tacos,170,Taco truck with picnic tables outside to eat on. Went for breakfast on a Saturday morning with my GF. Breakfast tacos are 2.50   amp  3 . I got a spinach  amp  egg taco and a potato  chorizo   amp  egg taco. The tacos were delicious and the egg was cooked perfectly. Friendly Mexican man inside truck who doesn t speak great english. Tacos were prepared in an reasonable amount of time.  8.75 10
Granny's Tacos,171,I am a fan of this Taco Truck  One of my favorite breakfast tacos - that s saying a lot since tacos are somewhat of an Austin Food specialty.   I like the variety of options and ingredients offered on their menu. I m a veggie girl so I was a big fan of their Haley Bowl  I also am a big broccoli fan - I ve never seen anywhere else offer broccoli on tacos    The tortillas were soft and fresh - unsure if they are made in the truck but if they are not  they fooled me.  My only complaints were  1. I asked for one of my tacos without cheese and their was cheese on it - luckily I do not have a lactose allergy but dairy doesn t make me feel great.  2. It typically takes quite a while if there are more than a few people ordering tacos. I would not recommend stopping here for a quick bite to eat.
Granny's Tacos,172,If you are from out of town and want to try Austin s famous breakfast tacos  this is the place to go. Texas sized portions and Austin sized prices. The shrimp quesillda is a must try
Granny's Tacos,173,Great tacos  A cute family owned business with great food and great service.   We ordered the al pastor  campechano  steak and chorizo  and my bf got the abuela taco  shredded pork with adobo sauce . He said the abuelo taco was amazing  so much so he ate it all without saving me a bite  and that it was the best of the three. I thought the al pastor was delicious and the campechano was a little too salty for my taste  probably because of the chorizo. All our tacos came on flour tortillas  but I m not sure if the option for corn tortillas is available.   The salsas are great and really spicy  which I love. The wait takes a bit of time but everything is made in-house and is great quality. There are 5-6 picnic tables with umbrellas to sit and enjoy your food.   Great casual taco food truck to visit if you re staying in east Austin 
Granny's Tacos,174,Flew all the way from Boston to try these tacos. Highly recommend these were the best we have ever had  10 10
Granny's Tacos,175,Tacos are phenomenal  reminds me of deep Mexican rooted breakfast tacos with mixed use of fresh avocados  panela cheese  salsa  veggies. Highly recommend
Granny's Tacos,176,I stumbled upon this one day while working in downtown the reviews were high and the prices were fair the pictures were amazing tasty like you can almost smell them so I decided to venture off and have lunch it was a great experience the tacos were amazing nice portions of chopped up vegetables the sauces our something that your taste buds will be dancing around your mouth for more and more of.
Granny's Tacos,177,Green sauce  chilaquiles taco is amazing. I also like the mole but if you do not like mole don t get it. It has been very polarizing in my group. Everyone get the green sauce though 
Granny's Tacos,178,We went here specifically because it was the first place we ve seen with 5 stars after hundreds of reviews. We were expecting to get blown away but it really wasn t all that. That did however have good service  quick turnaround  and reasonable prices. As a Mexican  I was not that impressed. I guess I was expecting more authentic tacos. I give them 3.5 stars.
Granny's Tacos,179,This is my favorite taco truck in Austin. I love their el pastor tacos  All of their tacos have great flavor and their fresh tortillas and salsa really take this taco truck a step above the rest.
Granny's Tacos,180,Does not live up to the hype and way too salty. Decent food though just does not live up to the hype. Got a quesadilla that was large enough for two meals  very cheesy and loaded  but also way too heavy on the salt
Granny's Tacos,181,Awesome corner for tacos and sit in  Try the mole taco  the flavor is so great  nothing empowering.
Granny's Tacos,182,Best tacos ever   We couldn t go to Austin without a stop here.  Huge and stuffed full of goodness.  My guy always orders more than he can eat in one sitting. No worries he saved the last one and enjoyed it for breakfast the next day. A great buy and yummy.
Granny's Tacos,183,Tacos large enough to be burritos. These were the best we had during our time to Austin. Worth going out of your way  if not even in your plans.
Granny's Tacos,184,The Abuela Taco and Migas Taco were decent. The salsas  could ve been a lot better  especially the red one. Loved the atmosphere.
Granny's Tacos,185,I pulled up into a little parking lot and there s a food truck with a nice tent for you to sit under. I was driving along C sar Ch vez in the morning when I got hungry I decided to stop at the most convenient place and this was it. I ordered a migas and Macha breakfast taco. First of all these tacos are humongous so two will fill you up. Unless you are under 23 and you probably have a high metabolism you could probably kill three or four of these. The salsa is delicious and a big chunk of egg fell out of one of my tacos. I was a little sad but I continued eating anyways. Overall would come here again to try out there afternoon menu. Seems like a good spot to BYOB and have some tacos.
Granny's Tacos,186,LOVEEEEE their tacos. This place is a must  I don t live in Austin but make it a point to stop by every time I m there. That s not an exaggeration. They re a simple food truck but man the tacos are amazing. You can tell they re made with love. It s like my abuela is in the back making them  They have some creative extravagant tacos all the way down to basic bacon and egg. Everything is good. There s a few tables out front to sit at with umbrellas for shade. Do yourself a favor and stop by granny s  
Granny's Tacos,187,I can t recommend The steak torta with added fresh jalape os more  I m sitting in bed hungry as all get out wishing I could have one right now but it s 7am so I ll just have to wait a few hours. I m a big Southern California Mexican food fan and I m pretty hard to please when it comes to Austin Mexican food  but this place is the best in town  no doubt about it
Granny's Tacos,188,I touched down in Austin with about three hours to burn  and I decided then and there that I would spend those hours visiting three of the highest rated taco spots in East Austin before writing a three way heads up review  so let s get this party started.  Tacos Guerrero vs. Granny s Tacos vs. La Sabroza  Star 1  How were the service and atmosphere   All three of these taco spots were trucks  with Tacos Guerrero being the largest and Granny s Tacos the smallest. That s not really relevant as all three spots also had nearby picnic tables for local diners  but I thought it was interesting nonetheless that all three were dealing with the same kitchen parameters within which to whip up their wares. Granny s took the cake as far as a quaint atmosphere went with a super friendly server to boot  but all three of these spots were perfectly fine.   Tacos Guerrero  Star  1  Granny s Tacos  Star  1  La Sabroza  Star  1   Star 2  How were the portions relative to the cost   When the heck did street tacos in Austin become so much more expensive than LA  To be fair these are larger tacos  but I was pretty surprised at paying between  2.00 and  3.00 for a single taco. The prices shook out per the below  and La Sabroza had notably smaller tacos compared to the competition   Tacos Guerrero   2.00 for breakfast   2.50 for lunch Granny s Tacos   3.00 for lunch La Sabroza   2.00 for lunch  Granny s were more expensive  but they ended up being the largest  and the best.  Tacos Guerrero  Star  2  Granny s Tacos  Star  2  La Sabroza  Star  2   Stars 3 and 4  How was the food   It s here that the grown-ups separated themselves from the children if you will. La Sabroza had some pretty weak offerings in my mind  with mediocre meats  asada had very little taste  that were slightly overcooked. Tacos Guerrero had good tacos for both breakfast and lunch with ingredients that were nice and cooked together  but both fell woefully short of Granny s  which were exceptional.   My pastor lunch taco at Granny s was marvelous  with a fresh lightly toasted tortilla  wonderfully flavorful pastor  and some nice peripherals like freshly chopped cilantro and just a smidge of pico that brought everything together with their excellent salsas. Wonderful.  Tacos Guerrero  Single Star  3  Granny s Tacos  Two Stars  4  La Sabroza  No Stars  2   Star 5  Would you eat here every day if you could   Granny s  Yes. La Sabroza or Tacos Guerrero  Not so much.  Tacos Guerrero  No Star  3  Granny s Tacos  Star  5  La Sabroza  No Star  2 
Granny's Tacos,189,First stop on our taco tour of Austin  and did not disappoint   Super friendly  lots of recommendations and quickly prepared.  The abuela taco was an explosion of flavor and the chilaquil was really unique and delicious mole. 5 stars no question.
Granny's Tacos,190,Simply DELICIOUS  This place was defiantly worth the hype tried different tacos and they were all so so good. Will be coming back soon
Granny's Tacos,191,Amazing tacos   The best breakfast taco I ve had.  I chose the Ranchero taco with green sauce.  The taco was huge   Loved the crispy pork skin in the taco.  I will definitely return 
Granny's Tacos,192,Best taco truck in town  Busy place but no long lines most of the time. They close early. Parking few spots but I ve never had issues finding spot. Very friendly staff. Tacos are amazing and very affordable. Recommend the specialty tacos. Picadiallo  machaca and shrimp. My favorite is the shrimp. Highly recommended
Granny's Tacos,193,Had the roja chilaquiles taco and Im already thinking about getting one again tomorrow. Delicious tacos. Ample portions. Don t sleep on this one.
Granny's Tacos,194,Food is amazing. Came all the way from Washington DC to try this and was not disappointed. Got a quesadilla and some breakfast tacos. Definitely worth the wait in line
Granny's Tacos,195,I don t like sour cream-but I love Granny s sour cream  Omg the homemade tortillas will be on my mind for the rest of the day... Looks to be family-run  which is amazing. Truly tastes homemade 
Granny's Tacos,196,Just visiting Austin and I found this place on tik tok. I ordered the abuela  the alambre  the veggie  amp  a steak taco.  The meat from the tacos was tender  seasoned well  amp  the portions for the tacos were perfect. The tacos held well  I hate when you take a bite  amp  they fall apart  the downfall of the tacos was the amount of grease which I guess is expected from a taco truck. Prices were reasonable  amp  the gentleman working was friendly. The seating area was clean and hand sanitizer was provided. The cactus in the veggie tacos was delicious  it melted in your mouth  amp  was full of flavor. Overall great experience  amp  happy we made the stop to check it out.
Granny's Tacos,197,Incredible tacos. But order ahead because they take an hour to fulfill your order. Get the El Alambra. It s incredible and so greasy
Granny's Tacos,198,This place has five stars for a reason. So  so good. Of all the food trucks in Austin  of all the taco places in Austin  this is a memorable experience. The breakfast tacos are amazing.
Granny's Tacos,199,Delicious and affordable  Tried tacos and the Haley bowl  bother of which were great. The people working were super nice and helpful. I will definitely be returning
Granny's Tacos,200,Tacos are fantastic. I highly recommend the handmade corn tortillas. We got one of each of the specialty tacos  ranchero  machaca  and Migas  and a pastor lunch taco.   Pastor has a pineapple pico on top that adds just the right amount of sweet  in combination with the red hot sauce that gives a great heat.   Reasonably priced and very delicious. I highly recommend this place 
Granny's Tacos,201,I was next door getting coffe and couldn t help but see  amp  smell this taco truck. Got an abuela and cactus tacos. Was not disappointed.  I even shared..... I will be back to try something new. Love Austin and their taco truck options.
Granny's Tacos,202,Cheap  delicious  awesome. How many more positive adjectives could I use to describe Grannys Tacos  A million. Go getchu some  
Granny's Tacos,203,Tacos are great  prices are great. Right by a dope lil coffee shop that is always jam packed with baddies and vibes. Seating is outside due to the food truck situation and usually packed so be ready to eat standing  hunched over like an animal with these bad boys you animal
Granny's Tacos,204,Best food truck tacos I ve enjoyed in Austin    The meats are well flavored. The salsas are balance with a fair amount of heat. Outdoor atmosphere is pleasant.
Granny's Tacos,205,Tried the Red Chiliquiles and a Rico  both were amazing. The mole on the rice  fantastic flavor. The chips in the red sauce were still crispy. The homemade tortillas are the real deal  only thing was that one of my tacos tortillas were ripped and the whole thing collapsed. Still  the flavors were on point.
Granny's Tacos,206,Wow  This place took me by complete surprise. The taco truck is very unsuspecting and I never would ve guessed they turned out such incredible food. I ordered the Alambre taco with chicken on a homemade corn tortilla and it knocked my damn socks off  The flavors were bursting in every bite. I m already looking forward to my next visit.
Granny's Tacos,207,Straight up the best breakfast tacos in Austin - hands down.  3.5 for the biggest tacos with homemade corn tortillas  fresh ingredients  and the best red salsa I ve had in the city.   Great people behind the counter that are always kind. This place is a gem.
Granny's Tacos,208,I loved all the tacos I got here. Service was great  There are some benches nearby for dining
Granny's Tacos,209,A  . These guys do it all  good food  good service  good atmosphere  and if you top that off with good company for a little weekend brunching  you re set for a perfect afternoon outing.   I came here this past Saturday and loved everything about my experience. Originally  I wanted to try gorditas  which sadly they didn t have  but I got the chilaquiles and a pastor taco instead and both were great. The chilaquiles taco was somehow sweet  balancing out the saltiness of the meat  while the pastor taco had some of the most tender meat that I ve tread  amazing but a little on the greasy side . I would say that this spot is a solid 10 10 and highly recommend it   Also  hint hint  Vintage Heart Coffee is right next door so if you haven t gone already  that s a must too 
Granny's Tacos,210,Fantastic try anything with the chorizo and you will be happily pleased. Thank you for being open during this time it was a great first experience with me and my friends 
Granny's Tacos,211,Amazing tacos and I recommend the alambres highly 
Granny's Tacos,212,Wow  if you love tacos you will absolutely love this place. Fantastic tasting tacos  my girlfriend destroyed her Veggie tacos and their alambre is great  Def recommend coming and trying it 
Granny's Tacos,213,Tried 6 different tacos. The Al pastor was good  but not the best I ve tried in Austin. The Migas  the chorizo  and the Chilaquiles with mole sauce  however  were A  some of the best tacos I ve ever had. Can t wait to try more next time I m in town.
Granny's Tacos,214,I had an amazing breakfast burrito that was big enough for both breakfast and dinner. I can t wait to come back.   
Granny's Tacos,215,   they are awesome  but unfortunately use Grubhub     yes its covid times  and are the days when you are concerned on everybodys safety  try our best to support small local biz  we tend to mostly go with online orders..Granny Tacos are honest business with the best tasting food..especially their red tacos    yumm They are doing their best to support surrounding communities  but here is why they get one star less..for continuing to use crappy GRUBHUB that screws up orders so often and did with mine today again  10am i place order on yelp routes through grubhub I get message food ready to pick up between 10 30 and 11..30 min window  wtf I leave home at 10 15 to make sure I get fresh hot food  willing to wait 30 min if necessary I find out my Tacos are cold because they were ready at 10 10..wtf i also find out my order items were missing wtffff well i reached back home at 11 00 my family ate cold tacos.. tasty but cold  The business had no idea of this mess up by GRUBHUB.  added to this there are some jokers who still swear by Grubhub..sheesh  I  highly recommend you to call and place order directly with dear Granny
Granny's Tacos,216,Super authentic tacos  Outdoor seating but also able to sit indoors next door at the coffee shop. They have homemade salsas that are full of flavor  Abuela taco was my favorite 
Granny's Tacos,217,This has been one of my favorite Taco places as I m a regular now  and I d have to say one of the Top 3 Taco places in Austin.  Granny s Tacos really does it well as you can tell she puts a lot of love into her food.    There s so many great things about this place  let me lay it out    1.  The Breakfast Tacos ROCK   My favorite ones are the Veggie Taco  with egg  and the Spinach   Egg   Cheese.  I always get them on corn  the tacos are always large with plenty of egg and toppings  it s just really good and doesn t bog you down.    2.  The Chicken Mole Taco is AWESOME   I love love this taco and get it on every visit  always on corn  it keeps well overnight  and lots of chicken and the mole is very flavorful.  It s definitely one of my faves.    3.  Her salsa selection ROCKS   She s got 4 of them and they re all so very tasty and carry some heat.  The green rivals the Dona  her red salsa is more robust and carries extra heat - - I love the flavor.  She has a pot of fresh salsa you scoop out with a ladle - - omg it s really flavorful.  The bright orange is their habanero - - for which her husband created and she perfected.  It s really hot but packs a lot of flavor.    4.  I love her homemade corn tortillas   I d describe it as a thicker yellow corn  very robust  not the thin and flimsy corn tortillas I m used to  and it s really flavorful.  She does a superb job in putting the tacos together and packaging them.   5.  Great bang for the buck - - I think you get a great quality product here  with her tacos being larger than some places  for a great price.  You can t ask for more.  Some taco places leave you asking for more  but her tacos are filling and quality good.  I usually buy a few and store a couple in the fridge for the next morning - - they all keep very well.    I can eat her awesome food and never feel bogged down afterwards  and that s how I know she uses quality ingredients.  The service here has always been very friendly and courteous.  This lovely husband and wife couple are always really nice as we love to talk and catch up on the latest  and I always remind the hubby how lucky he is to have someone who is such a great cook and makes exceptional food.  He definitely knows and appreciates it.
Granny's Tacos,218,Save time and order through here    Torta was phenomenal  Just the right amount of unhealthy without being heavy and greasy  that Mexican comfort food  Was big enough for me and my fianc  to share    they are 5 star for a reason  
Granny's Tacos,219,Wow    These are some of the best tacos I ve personally ever had. Their corn tortillas are a must get    The gentleman in the window was very helpful with recommendations and explaining the menu. I will definitely stop here every single time I m in Austin for my taco fix   
Granny's Tacos,220,I really enjoyed both of the tacos I got from Granny s Tacos   I had the Campechano taco which has steak  chorizo  pico de gallo and avocado in it.  I also had the chilaquil verde taco which was unique and super delicious   We stood in line for about 20 minutes and the wait was about 25 minutes for our tacos.  There are plenty of tables right in front of the taco truck but it was pretty busy on a Sunday afternoon.  I would recommend this taco truck if you are in the area   The staff member who took our order and served our food was also very friendly 
Granny's Tacos,221,The mole chicken Rico taco was tasty but only had chicken and rice. The abuela taco Had shredded pork  adovo sauce with pico and avocado. That was taste year. The veggie taco  potatoes spinach onion cilantro cheese cactus with refried beans or an egg  amp  avocado. and the Chilaquil taco I ve been told are good. Green or red mole sauce with onion chicken sour cream and Mexican cheese. Homemade and tasty 
Granny's Tacos,222,I had 2 steak tacos and one of the shrimp tacos..both were amazing   The steak tacos were my favorite. Everything was seasoned to perfection and extremely delicious. Service here is great as well and really fast. GREEN SALSA IS A MUST. Will be back 
Granny's Tacos,223,I live in Dallas and recently visited Austin  I was craving some delicious breakfast tacos before my hike and Granny s did not disappoint. These tacos were so flavorful and filling  I got the chorizo con papas and migas. Fast and friendly service   Best breakfast tacos I ve ever had 
Granny's Tacos,224,Don t come here and complain about the wait. You re waiting because the food is amazing and many other people know that too.   EXPECT A WAIT and then enjoy   Jerks muttering about poor service GO HOME
Granny's Tacos,225,Omggggg.  Legit tastes like my grandma made it. Super fresh  super friendly  HUGE portions. I found my new go-to spot
Granny's Tacos,226,Seriously  a segment of our conversation    Mr Vasquez   Ask your phone who has the best tacos.  Me     Hey Siri  who has the best tacos in Austin  Texas   Siri     The highest rated option I found is Granny s Tacos  which averages 5 stars and is inexpensive.  Me     Did you by chance  practice law at some point      Chef Vasquez really is a granny doing all the cooking in this trailer  and it s her husband you ll be dealing with up front. I believe their daughters are the Veracruz All Natural dynasty found throughout Austin  and you kind of wish you had a dollar for every taco this family s been involved with. A lot of passion here.   You can play it safe with a fajita taco that s pretty good  but it s her specialty tacos that are pretty great. The big chunk of avocado in the shredded pork Abuela was a perfect pairing  and they insisted I switch to a homemade corn tortilla for their Mole chicken  amp  rice. They were correct. I started thinking   I want more of all this on a plate.  I never got around to trying the salsas in a cooler  none of my stuff needed it.     I always benchmark breakfast tacos at a place I ve never been to before  but they were literally out of eggs on a Thursday at 1 30pm. I ll just have to get there earlier. And yes  I shouldn t jump the gun with five stars before trying a classic bacon  amp  egg  but my instinct is I won t be disappointed. Besides  it s iOS 12 already  and Siri said so.
Granny's Tacos,227,Some reviews are all hype...A place with a 5 star rating is rare these days...But the hype is real...place is small...drove by the first time  and had to loop around the block...parking is limited  but there is some 15 minute customer service limited spots...Service is great with a warm welcome and a smile...Keeping it simple with a couple Bacon  Egg and Cheese...Tortillas are awesome  and the ingredients have that griddle flavor and color...White Shredded cheese is there choice  which give it a different flavor all together...Tacos are loaded  and I only tried the green sauce in the cooler...This place it on target for our adventures towards downtown  being on the east side of 35...its easy to get too..
Granny's Tacos,228,Now I see what the hype is about. Some of the best breakfast tacos we have found in Austin. Everything was awesome.
Granny's Tacos,229,Delicious and authentic family owned taco truck in the middle of no-where Austin. Took a bit to get the food but that was it was well worth it 
Granny's Tacos,230,Omg      We are touring texas and definitely had to stop by for 6th street. My buddy saw my check in at Austin and was like dude have your brunch at Granny s and I was like naa  Don t wAnt to go off track my route. But I am glad I took his recommendation seriously and took that detour. The best decision I took in this trip fOr the soul food.    loved every bite of it. So we were 4 of us and one of them is vegetarian even she enjOyed her tacos. I loved my tortA. I ordeRed  this with chicken and the portion was insanely big. Then my buddy ordEred rico taco with mole sauce truly justified  3.50 price for a taco. The surprise and unique   Was their breakfast taco. Again super awesome. Also tHey  have salsas in the container it was one of a kind. The red one in the bottle had a kick to it. The regular salsa was yum too. The green salsaa was my fav. Shake it and then use it. Overall thumbs up for this taco truck. Service was good and quick. We didn t face any Parking issues as well.
Granny's Tacos,231,Quick order  nice and messy tacos... could not recommend enough. Don t wear a white shirt  you will wear part of the taco 
Granny's Tacos,232,Five stars for a reason  Great food  huge portions and great service--eat here  I absolutely loved the food here  fantastic  All my tacos were amazing with great meat and seasoning. Shrimp Quesadilla  Armando and Alambre taco were pipping hot  delicious and rocked my world. When I think of awesome Mexicana food  this place is it. You need to have it   
Granny's Tacos,233,If you are looking for tacos do not waste your time going to the  instagram worthy  restaurants around the city. Granny s tacos is one of the best if not best tacos I have ever tried  I have visited Mexico before and plenty of famous Mexican restaurants around the US. There is no comparison  these tacos are flavorful and simple nothing new but pure traditional home made food. I understand that they close early in the afternoon and I think that is probably one of the secrets to the exceptional cooking and service  not overworking anyone and giving plenty of time for food prep.  We had a couple of chorizo and egg tacos and they were great  then we tried the ranchero taco and it was even better  but when we tried the MOLE and SALSA VERDE tacos we were blown away by the flavor and complexity of the sauces on such a simple and well thought of taco you could really taste the freshness and each of the ingredients they were truly EXCEPTIONAL     and we will make sure to come to Austin just for these tacos  if you are lucky enough to actually live in Austin do yourself a favor and stop by.
Granny's Tacos,234,Was visiting Austin for a weekend. Was told I had to visit this spot for the best breakfast tacos. Wow  just wow  I d have to agree  this place really does have the best breakfast tacos. I only ordered two because they are big  but I wish I had ordered more to take home with me for later. I ll be back next time I visit Austin. In fact  this place is more reason to come back and visit Austin.
Granny's Tacos,235,Order the chilaquil-taco.  Order more than one.  Expect a wait for your food.  A long wait. Because it shouldn t take 15min to make a taco.  But be patient because if you do  you will be blown away and forget how long it took to get your food. It s SOO good. I wish I ordered more than one.  I will definitely be back next time I m in Austin 
Granny's Tacos,236,We ate at an absolute ton of tacos from various places of both truck and non-vehicle related establishment on our Austin trip  and Granny s were the best. It s a bit out of the way  and may not look like much  but at the end of the day you re there for the tacos and they be gooooooooodddddddd. The long and short of it   1. Tacos  Breakfast tacos. Non-breakfast tacos. Vegetarian tacos. Tacos with cactus. Bowls..... which are like deconstructed tacos. Lots of variety which is always nice to see. 2 tacos were plenty for everyone  I had 3 because I m a glutton . Everything was tasty and fresh. Worth a try over other Austin taco trucks.  2. Price  2 tacos and a bottle of water ran  9 which works for me and for what you get. We had tacos that were cheaper  as well as ones that were more expensive  so mid-price   quality   a good taco deal.  3. Wait  Granny s is pretty popular and they seem mostly made to order  so a pretty sizeable line will likely have formed outside when you get there. It may take a bit to get your food  which was the only negative part of the meal. Usually this wouldn t deter me but there are a lot of really good tacos in Austin  so Granny s would only be my main choice if I was in the area had time to wait. Worth it if that s your case.  4. Location  A bit out of the way but not un-walkable distance from 6th st. Make the journey if you re in the area.  Granny s was a shining light in the endless sea of taco trucks in Austin. Not so much better that others we tried to go out of our way  but we were in the area and it made for a great taco brunch. Worth a try   Overall Grade  B
Granny's Tacos,237,The food here is incredible and if you spend any time in Austin you need to at least try one of their tacos. I ve tried a variety of tacos  quesadillas  and the guac. It s all fantastic  but I love the tacos the most and smother everying in Granny s sauce. It s really delicious. There s no question it s one of the very best taco food trucks in Austin and you re missing out if you haven t eaten here. It s also super convenient that you can place your order ahead of time online. In my experience the projected order readiness time has always been accurate so additional bonus points for saving me time 
Granny's Tacos,238,I ve been searching for my new taco spot in Austin for a while now  now that Houston has Tacodeli and Torchy s to claim for its own.  I haven t explored too much since leaving Austin  but a friend recommended it to me  and I have to say  it s a winner   The owner here is really friendly  and gives great recommendations.  I had the ranchero  campechano  and granny tacos  and they were all fantastic.  I HIGHLY recommend the ranchero one though - it comes with chicharron and avocado   It s a fantastic combination.  The sauces here too are great as well - their green sauce is spicy and creamy  reminiscent of tacodeli s dona sauce.  It goes well with anything   Other tacos of note I d want to try - there s tacos that contain broccoli and cactus  which my friends really enjoyed.  I also wanted to try the chilaquiles one too     Come hungry.  You re going to want to try a good number of these  and these tacos are pretty good sized.  I d recommend 2-4 depending on how hungry you are - but if you can  go for more   I give granny the matt thumbs up of approval 
Granny's Tacos,239,These are not your Granny s tacos. But you ll wish they were. Whether you re looking for breakfast or lunch  the food truck Granny s Tacos is sure to be a hit while in Austin  Texas. The veggie taco was sensational  filled with potatoes  spinach  onion  cilantro  cheese  cactus  your choice of refried beans or egg  and topped with fresh beautiful avocado.  Whether you re a vegetarian or not  these are a major hit. The chilaquiles taco was equally as amazing  your choice of has green  red  or  get the  mole sauce  with onion  chicken  sour cream  and Mexican cheese. Deeply flavorful  but everything tastes better with some verde. Just a knock out  authentic  memorable stop  you sure don t have to spend a fortune to eat well in Austin 
Granny's Tacos,240,Amazing tacos  Great combinations of flavors combos that really work unlike other places. I usually stay away from chicken tacos but the ones here with the mole sauce absolute
Granny's Tacos,241,They are amazing. Everything was very tasty super delicious the Food took an average time to be ready  we saw a lot of people who were just taking out. They don t have coffee but they have a coffee shop  close by so we went to get coffee there. The food is great and their service excellent.
Granny's Tacos,242,I got the breakfast taco with broccoli  egg  cheese and potatoes on a handmade corn tortilla. It was SO yummy and under  4.  The owner was very nice as well. I would definitely come back again.
Granny's Tacos,243,Seriously the best breakfast tacos I ve ever eaten  The ingredients are super fresh and flavorful  the salsas pack just the right amount of kick and the owners are super friendly   I ve seen a couple of reviews complaining about paying  3.50 for a taco...if you want a dollar taco go to Taco Bell. If you re a taco lover who s going to appreciate quality ingredients Granny s does not disappoint 
Granny's Tacos,244,Went with my brother for the first time and the people working there were very friendly. You could tell the truck had clean operations and they had a good stream of customers. The food was awesome. Everything was seasoned well and felt light but filling. We tried a chicken torta  beef and shrimp tacos  and the mole taco with red sauce. I had a great meal for the price 
Granny's Tacos,245,Almost didn t want to post a review because i don t want this spot being ruined by being over populated or by the hipsters. This is the best breakfast taco I ve had in a super long time  Home made tortillas too  would recommend to anyone as long as we can keep it away from the hipsters haha.
Granny's Tacos,246,Good tacos from a small trailer hidden in an alley between 6th and 7th.   6 for two tacos  my usual spot is a little cheaper.   I ll be back when in this area.
Granny's Tacos,247,Very disappointed in this food truck.  They say they are open at 8 am.  Not true. People were waiting and no one showed up.  So unprofessional.  What can you expect from a food truck   Go to Juan in a million... great tacos there 
Granny's Tacos,248,Oh man there are a ton of breakfast tacos out in Austin this ones by far my all time favorite   go-to  Ordered ahead online and it was perfectly on time and easy pick up. Location is in a food truck park area in a white little truck. It is the best  seriously  it has 5 stars for a reason for most of its reviews. Every taco I ve had here has been amazing and I ll come back every time I m in Austin.
Granny's Tacos,249,Got to Austin and missed this place because it was closed for the day. Next two days it was closed for the holiday. The day I leave Austin this place was open.... and it was well worth the wait. Awesome Awesome Awesome.
Granny's Tacos,250,The only con is that you may have to wait for your order to be called for awhile.  BUT what really matters is   Price - super reasonable at 2.50 per breakfast taco. Taste - sooo good  Value - made to order and filled to the brim  Such a lovely owner and wife    team behind these tacos.
Granny's Tacos,251,Holy smokes  Their tacos were sooooo good. And the wait was really quick which I appreciated since the entire family was famished. They had a nice little seating area. I went with the Alambre tacos and devoured them. We re definitely coming back here 
Granny's Tacos,252,Really good  surprisingly large tacos. They are stuffed to the brim with meat and goodies so you ll definitely leave full. I say 2 will make you content for an average person is plenty  3 if you re pretty hungry.  I opted for a steak fajita  an al pastor and a ranchero. The al pastor is good deep red  slightly smoky with just a bit of pineapple to balance it all out. The steak fajita is flavorful  albeit salty - not much onion  pepper filler - its all beef  I actually would prefer some more vegetation to cut the salt and the meatiness.  But whats the best about Granny s is the ranchero. Ever wanted non-vegetarian migas  That s the glory of the ranchero as they add pork rinds to your tacos on top of the chips  eggs  and avocado. Yes it s all in there and it works gloriously in a textural sense. Slap some of that spicy green salsa on there and you have a perfectly balanced taco. I might have to say its the new best breakfast taco in Austin that I ve tried.  Their tortillas look  feel and taste homemade too. I guess I forgot to specify corn or flour but the flour ones I got by default were all excellent.  So come on over to Granny s. They ll treat you like you re at home  if your home is a food trailer on the east side that is .
Granny's Tacos,253,Got the shrimp quesadilla  abuela taco and chorizo egg potato and cheese taco. All were 10 10 and ready quickly. There s a few parking spots in front of the truck you can pull into for pick up and also street parking around. There s a few picnic tables in front of the truck if you choose to eat there. Will be back 
Granny's Tacos,254,I placed an online order through their website but I guess it was forgotten because I tried to pick up but they had no idea what I was talking about. After finding my order  I waited another 40 min so I waited a total of 70  minutes for my 3 tacos. And after all that  they order was wrong. The tacos were also disappointingly small  IMO . I understand the staff was working hard so I ll give it two stars for only that.
Granny's Tacos,255,This place is amazing   I got the La Gringa and It s so filling for under  6. The owner is super friendly and I would say this is probably the best taco food truck in Austin. It s located in a random place so might be difficult to find if you aren t intentionally looking for it. We actually found this food truck after studying at a coffee shop near by.   I would definitely recommend trying it if you re in Austin and is looking for great tacos     best taco food truck in austin 
Granny's Tacos,256,Found this place on Yelp and the tacos where amazing     We even stopped on our way back to airport to get some to go     Stop by you won t regret it    
Granny's Tacos,257,I got the Ranchero  amp  Granny Taco. I love the Ranchero - less loved the Granny. These tacos have a lot of flavor so you really don t neeeeed salsa. Also pretty good size  Definitely lived up to its hype.
Granny's Tacos,258,The name tells no lies. My grandma was born and lived in Mexico for 50 years. Her food is still my favorite ever but my god this place gets a close second.  The tacos were amazing. Please get the Abuela Taco it is one of my favorite tacos in all of Austin.  Their tortillas are handmade and fresh.  The salsa is just like my grandma makes.  The beans and rice are superb.    I love love love this place.   instagram for more food pics and reviews  garbieleats
Granny's Tacos,259,AMAZING family run business with some of the best Tacos you ve ever had   We sampled both breakfast and lunch and were blown away by he flavor  size  and economical price point.  Keep up the good work and well worth the wait 
Granny's Tacos,260,This was a good place to eat and you should check them out but the wait is so long  I had a bad experience too because they messed up on my order and closed before I could come back and fix it. I ordered the quesadilla and tacos but enjoyed the quesadilla more. Would come here again but only if I order online  definitely not in person again.
Granny's Tacos,261,Yes yes yes     Granny s tacos are so yummy in my tummy.  I had a spinach egg cheese and one chorizo egg potato  cheese taco.  The fresh spinach with cheese were well paired   The star of the show though was the chorizo.  Their chorizo was well seasoned and NOT greasy at all.  As is the food want enough  they offer fresh salsa  pico and spicy avocado salsa   Zing a ding ding  theses tacos are the real thing 
Granny's Tacos,262,By far the BEST breakfast taco I have ever had. The tortilla  the cheese  the eggs and even the bacon were cooked to perfection. 1000000 10. I will be coming back to this place  
Granny's Tacos,263,Granny s tacos are always delicious and quick to pick up  I have never had a bad taco from Granny s. They also have a great central location that s close to multiple coffee shops - you can t beat the breakfast taco coffee combo 
Granny's Tacos,264,Awesome little Taco Truck   What to get  - Potato  Egg  and Cheese Taco  2.50.  It sounds a little basic  but everything works so well together.  The cheese is particularly good.  It s one of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had.  Tips  - They have outdoor picnic table seating with large umbrellas for shade - They accept credit cards  - They are located very close to Revival Coffee  Highly Rated .
Granny's Tacos,265,Tacos here are so delicious. I had a veggie taco and my friend had a Rico taco  it was really fresh and tasted very good. Loved their salsa and the sauces. Also  the owners are very nice and welcoming.   This place is definitely a must try 
Granny's Tacos,266,I got the Abuela taco on corn  it came out on flour but it tasted amazing anyway  Good sized taco  I only needed one and I was full  I ate it all before I remembered to take a picture
Granny's Tacos,267,Some of the best tacos in Austin--hands down  I always come back because the tacos are so delicious. There s a reason why people are talking about Granny s Tacos. The hype is real 
Granny's Tacos,268,Loved everything we had - chicken  shrimp - great  Very reasonably priced and nice portion sizes.
Granny's Tacos,269,We loved our food. The chicken quesadilla and al pastor burrito were delicious and their seating area is clean and comfortable. Guacamole was ok.. We would eat here again.
Granny's Tacos,270,Best breakfast tacos I ve had yet   Ordered the potato chorizo  bacon egg  and turkey sausage egg  Washed it down with a Topo Chico Granny wasn t there when we went on a Friday morning  but we heard she is on Monday Tuesday Wednesday 
Granny's Tacos,271,Best tacos I ve had in Austin. Al pastor was fantastic  but they also have a lot of veggie options which is a huge plus. Chips are homemade  thick  and crispy. Salsa is unmatched. Not to mention- the price   Tacos in Austin for a reasonable price    Unheard of. Completely worth a drive  will always be my taco rec.
Granny's Tacos,272,Excellent breakfast tacos. By far the best mole I have ever had. They were busy and I ordered in advance. Food was ready when I get there and they were busy. Great job 
Granny's Tacos,273,Amazing and authentic tacos. Very large for the price. Chicken mole  shrimp  alambre are my go to tacos. Gets busy so order ahead. Highly recommend 
Granny's Tacos,274,Really great food that was well worth the minimal wait and the prices were fair to generous. The breakfast burrito was probably the best thing we got  but the breakfast tacos were really great. It would have been nice to have more seating for how busy it got  but we sat in the car just on the street and had a great time.
Granny's Tacos,275,They are amazing. The food is great and their service excellent. My family had a torta and a quesadilla and we order 1 of each kind of taco to try them. We loved everything.
Granny's Tacos,276,Super good  worth the wait. Mole was awesome  salsas are fresh and tasty. The Chilaquil appears to be their specialty  and it s a cool take on a classic breakfast dish.
Granny's Tacos,277,100  best tacos I ve ever had. And the service is fantastic  Highly recommend the Abuela and mole tacos in particular. The meat was tender  juicy  and packed to the brim - no skimping here  I ordered 3 tacos and was stuffed the rest of the day. We will be back 
Granny's Tacos,278,Wonderful.     There was 4 of us and we all loved everything.  Shrimp taco.  Haley bowl  Quesadilla  cactus taco  campeciano taco.    Wonderful service  and food.  So glad we stopped
Granny's Tacos,279,Another happy customer for Granny s Tacos. I came here some breakfast tacos and they were awesome. Plentiful and the red sauce was so good. I ll be trying more of the menu in the coming weeks  but I imagine Yelper s know that it s all good.
Granny's Tacos,280,Great tacos but be prepared to wait 30-45 minutes once you ve ordered.   Even if just 3 or 4 people in front of you 
Granny's Tacos,281,Absolutely hands down the best tacos in atx. All ingredients are so fresh and flavorful. The service was quick and very friendly. I highly recommend Granny s Tacos 
Granny's Tacos,282,Just get the mole chilaquil tacos and save some time figuring out where you should go for breakfast this morning
Granny's Tacos,283,We ended up here by chance.  We were on our way to Phoenician on SI35 frontage to take in supper before going to the Nicks Pretenders concert at The Erwin Ctr.  We were running behind schedule because of me  and  when we got downtown we were met with roadblocks   The whole area in front of Phoenician was blocked off for SXSW.  Dammit    Panick started to kick in as we didn t have a plan B.    I steered us towards Kebabalicious on the east side.  No red fish  but  a kebab sounded like the perfect plan B.  Well wouldn t you know there was no fucking parking to be found except across the street in front of some hammock store.  Parking there was metered at  10 for 6 hours   Fuck that   We parked anyway deciding we would sit outside on the patio and watch our car.  Then we saw this roach coach and some guy standing out in front of it.  Pretty much the conversation boiled down to us eating at Granny s and he would make sure we didn t get a ticket towed.  Not what I had in mind  but  that was a good deal and since we were already pressed for time  we took the gentleman up on his offer.  I got the chicken fajita on corn and Carl got the beef fajita on white.  We both enjoyed our tacos very much  but  I will point out that prep took quite a while.  We were already pressed for time and the stress made it all seem so much longer.  The tacos were definitely worth the wait.  The salsa was really good  and  those corn tortillas were da bomb   I would definitely eat here again and I do recommend that if you are in the area stop and check them out.  P.S.  We got to the concert with time to spare and really enjoyed both acts    One helluva show.  Thanks Granny s for being there  
Granny's Tacos,284,I wanted to love these tacos because there were so many amazing reviews but for a person who loves salty and savory food this place was over salted to the extreme. Everything had too much salt including their sauces. Maybe I just had bad lucky   but I would be scared to try it again. I give it a three because if it wasn t overly salty it would have been a 5 5. I tried three different ones  and they were all salty.
Granny's Tacos,285,This place had the best tacos I had while in Austin. Don t miss their mole taco - it was truly unique   This is a tiny taco truck tucked away off of the Main Street with a few picnic benches where you can eat. The food can take a bit  but it is absolutely worth the wait. You can really tell the people running the show care about each taco and dish they are preparing   The chilaquil taco was also a must  Definitely stop here in Austin.
Granny's Tacos,286,In a foodie town like Austin  when you see something that has five stars across-the-board you have to try it  and Granny s did not disappoint in the slightest. I m very glad that one of the reviews I read mentioned the mole because that s what I got and I will probably crave it for the rest of my life now. My husband got something that he loved  I think it was a breakfast taco of some sort but I was too obsessed with my mole taco to remember 
Granny's Tacos,287,Look no further. This place is the holy grail of breakfast tacos. I ve been here 3 times so far  with each time having ordered something new different. And each time  the food tasted flat out incredible. Their veggie and migas tacos are by far the best I ve had. I have a go-to salsa that I use at home but their salsas were so dang good that I didn t even need mine. This may very well be the pinnacle of breakfast tacos in the states  let alone Austin.
Granny's Tacos,288,I didn t mean to go here but I m so glad I did. What a sweet little taco truck. We were looking for coffee but saw the truck and decided it was destiny. We went with the cactus egg and cheese taco  and the chicharon taco. I m used to the fast paced city life  so when these tacos took 30 minutes to come out.. I was about to tear my eyelashes out. It felt like forever but honestly they were really great and the staff was apologetic about the wait  which they totally didn t need to be .  The chicharon taco had a beautiful crunch - get it.  Even the christian radio station they blast really added to the experience. Just take it easy  don t rush  and get these tacos.
Granny's Tacos,289,Grannys was great. We loved our breakfast tacos. Get Coffee next door at revival while you wait.  I loved the broccoli egg a cheese.
Granny's Tacos,290,Visiting Austin from Houston  and after a three hour drive  I was starving. So we were recommended this taco truck. . My husband and I ordered three tacos each thinking it was your typical breakfast or regular taco. One taco was filling and enough   We were not disappointed   Looking for authentic Mexican food   this is your place  Woke up the next morning craving Granny s taco. Reminded me of my grandmother s cooking   To top it off   great service  You can even call in your order ahead of time.   Looking for our next visit to Austin  Or  how about coming to Houston  
Granny's Tacos,291,The hours aren t great but if you can catch them open  it s delicious  Huge fresh authentic tacos at a very reasonable price. Good outdoor seating with large umbrellas. Wait can be a while  up to 30min to get your food depending on where you go. Highly recommend a bean egg cheese breakfast taco  the chilaquile mole  and the abuela taco. Will have to try the Rico next time.
Granny's Tacos,292,The taste is delicious but my last couple of visits  I had egg shells in all of my tacos   That makes it impossible to enjoy so I won t be coming back for awhile. It s unfortunate because I really enjoyed coming here before work. Please slow down and take time to remove egg shells.
Granny's Tacos,293,Really enjoyed this taco truck - it was one of the first places when visiting Austin where we found more interesting flavors  cactus   Relaxed outdoor seating available  and in a pretty calm  quiet part of town. I would definitely recommend 
Granny's Tacos,294,Very awesome place and sweet customer service   there is outside seating and it s a food truck.. you must try it to know what it s all about
Granny's Tacos,295,Best breakfast tacos ever. Go here and thank me later. I m going to fly back to Austin just to eat here again. It was the highlight of the trip.
Granny's Tacos,296,Taco selection is crafty and delicious    And the homemade corn tortillas were amazing. The steak steak alambre and shrimp tacos were divine.  Hearty portion too 
Granny's Tacos,297,SO SO SO SO GOOD  I ordered about 30 tacos through the Yelp app Sunday morning and it took about 1 hr and 1 2 for them to be ready. My family loved the chorizo tacos and the salsa is amazing. I also go steak  turkey sausage and bacon and egg. The only thing I suggest is that they label the tacos when they are togo. I had to look through everyone to find out which is which.
Granny's Tacos,298,Popped in for a couple tacos  and ended up with seven  One of the most authentic places I ve ever been to in the states. Highly recommend the chilaquiles taco with the mole sauce  their Abuela taco with the home made corn tortillas and their taco al pastor 
Granny's Tacos,299,I love love love this place  The tacos here are very fresh  one of my favorites is the veggie taco with beans. The shrimp tacos are very tasty as well. If you re going for some breakfast  you can t go wrong with  2.50 a taco and these beauties aren t tiny in size. My personal favorites are the BACON  EGG AND CHEESE tacos... soooo good      Also  the corn tortillas are made from scratch and wow they are delicious    The only con about Granny s Tacos is the wait. Sometimes it can take a while to get your tacos but TRUST ME... IT S WORTH IT. Everything here is very fresh and authentic. One of the owners is the father  Armando  of one of the owners at Vera Cruz All Natural so you know that he probably taught her all the little tips and tricks on how to make killer salsa and tacos    Good things come to those who wait   
Granny's Tacos,300,I ordered on Yelp and it was ready when I got there  15 minutes later  - These tacos are large. They do not not skimp out on giving you a lot of food  The salsa and chips are super fresh and just the right amount of spice. The price is awesome for what you get 
Granny's Tacos,301,WOW. This little food trailer on E 7th packs a punch -- some of the best tacos I have had in Austin  It s a bold statement in the taco Mecca of the southwest.   My brother comes here all the time and had recommended it to me  but by the time I got there I had forgotten what tacos he told me to get. I went for a potato egg and cheese and a chilaquiles taco with mole  Armando confirmed this was a good choice .   The chilaquiles was quite possibly the best thing I ve ever eaten  let alone best taco. The tortilla chunks inside were thick and fried but not so pokey as to spear ya in the mouth. The mole was just sweet and smoky enough. Granny makes the tortillas from scratch and sh   can you tell the difference. AMAZING.   We were surprised at the end of our meal with two complimentary blue corn tortilla tacos - apparently Monday is blue corn day. I wasn t hungry but I ate one anyway. Should really tell you all you need to know.
Granny's Tacos,302,For me  these are the breakfast tacos in Austin. While here I ve tried 6 of the 4 1 2 star or higher rated breakfast taco places. There are another 6 or 7 in that tier  but so far Granny s are a cut above everything else I ve had. Eggs are fluffy  their meat quality is great  but the tortillas are what I suspect are pushing them over the top. I will without a doubt prioritize a stop here any time I m in town as long as this place is still going. There the only 5 star rated spot for a reason. The Yelp hype is real.
Granny's Tacos,303,From a local to local  a great spot for fast and authentic service. I work downtown and enjoy getting breakfast tacos here if I forget breakfast and before my night shifts I enjoy the quesadilla al pastor.        Gracias 
Granny's Tacos,304,I ve been here only once  but the tacos at this food truck are excellent. I had a breakfast taco with steak and it was delicious. My buddies said the mole was good and authentic. I definitely recommend it and look forward to going back next time I m in the area.
Granny's Tacos,305,Best. Tacos. Ever. No question. I had the Vegetarian taco  and he has the Abuelas taco  and the Chilaquile taco. We were in heaven. Our mouths couldn t handle the deliciousness... and we hadn t even added their epic homemade salsas  The couple that runs Granny s is the sweetest. So so kind. And their service  exceptional. I can t wait to return 
Granny's Tacos,306,This review is strictly for their breakfast tacos. Perplexed about all the 5 star reviews. As others mentioned  the wait can be a bit long  20 minutes for me  but the tacos came out hot. At  2.50 each  it s not a bad deal for a pretty basic 3 ingredient breakfast taco. No seasoning of the eggs so you definitely need to add one of their sauces. The tacos were ok  just nothing special.
Granny's Tacos,307,Mole chilaquiles taco is sooo good  The corn tortillas are amazing along with the salsas.   The veggie taco is a hit too.   The breakfast tacos can be a little underwhelming so the tortilla and salsas def make up for it.  E.g. The potato chorizo didn t taste much chorizo   Went to vintage heart coffee afterwards and was rewarded for my effort.
Granny's Tacos,308,the  best  tacos  i love granny s and walk here at least x2 per week with my pup. it s my favorite place on the east side. friendly service  great prices and a fun menu with all sorts of tacos to choose from. def recommend the migas or chilaquil taco  verde   or any classic b-fast taco. their salsas are delicious  too   
Granny's Tacos,309,Huge tacos for  3.  I had the shrimp and al pastor.  Definitely would come back. The two tacos themselves were quite filling  but I did want to have more based on the taste 
Granny's Tacos,310,Might be the best tacos I have ever had  Really fresh ingredients great price too. I can t wait to go back.
Granny's Tacos,311,Great good  kind service  and overall great salsa.  Be sure to try the salsa in the cooler.
Granny's Tacos,312,I came on a gloomy rainy morning so I lucked out with only a short line. The cactus and egg was a little saltier than I d like  but the potato chorizo cheese and egg was SO good wow. Great prices too 
Granny's Tacos,313,The shrimp tacos and picadillo tacos are amazing   Such good food for a great price  10 10 will be back 
Granny's Tacos,314,Realized I was starving sitting in Revital Coffee  formerly Vintage Heart   and I noticed Granny s Tacos next door. Boy am I glad I stopped by. I ordered the veggie taco and the Abuela and they absolutely blew me away  and I ve been around the block as far as Austin tacos go. The staff is super friendly too    If you re in the area  I highly recommend trying it out 
Granny's Tacos,315,taco satisfaction GUARANTEED. If you re in the neighborhood  stop by. But I wouldn t go out of my way   Food  4  Service  4 Location  4.5  Price      ORDER  - shrimp quesadilla was maddd good  cheesy hot nom   - cactus egg cheese  tasted like green pepper. But very good - chorizo egg and cheese  very good  
Granny's Tacos,316,A few times in my life I ve gotten more pleasure from food alone while visiting a restaurant. I ve come to know that sometimes you meet people who are fantastic human beings first  who just happen to make food. Granny s is the type of place that gives me a happy heart from the kindness of the owner and a full stomach with the best breakfast tacos in Austin. My 5 star review might get lost in the copious amounts of stellar reviews of Granny s  but as I go I hope to leave you with a story that won t be lost. I asked Armando  the owner  why he is so happy all of the time. He said that he is happy because god is good  Well Armando  I don t know what heaven is like  but I think that if we do eat from time to time that someday you d be at the top of god s list to make us tacos and make us smile.
Granny's Tacos,317,We stumbled across this very popular and busy Food Truck after enjoying coffee nearby in the area today. We ordered a Chilaquil Taco and Ranchero Taco. They were both fantastic and full of flavour  we were not disappointed. When busy like today  you have a waiting time of about 20 minutes to get your Tacos  no complaining here  If you like a good food truck and taco then head here when ever passing through Austin. The service was fabulous  seating outside very relaxing and fabulous pricing at  3-  3.50 per Taco.
Granny's Tacos,318,Best tacos in Austin   Coming from a Mexican  Get the breakfast taco with egg  chorizo  amp  cheese... the bomb  
Granny's Tacos,319,I like how they converted an ambulance into a food truck that serves awesome tacos on handmade tortillas. I got one breakfast taco and one lunch. The chiliquilles taco came with fried tortilla strips  eggs  fresh peppers wrapped in a homemade tortilla. The taco was bursting with not only flavor but in abundance as the tortilla could not wrap. My lunch taco was a chicken mole and rice. That mole sauce was so delicious  and combined with rice really made the flavors burst. I was impressed with this place and I ll be back to try the rest of the menu.
Granny's Tacos,320,Oh my goodness  These tacos were so delicious  Please let s first start on the tortilla  you have to do corn tortilla  It s homemade and fresh. I m sure all tacos are amazing. The ones we tried were the ranchero  the chorizo and potato and the bacon egg and cheese. They blew my standards of a good breakfast burrito. But if you ask me  I d eat them at all hours. Haha the salsas were super great too. I hope I get to try some others before my vacation is over.
Granny's Tacos,321,Amazing food  cooked to order  and such friendly staff  I won t ever take a trip to Austin without visiting Granny s Tacos again   Best tacos I ve ever had  and for an amazing price too  This truck is ahidden gem.
Granny's Tacos,322,grabbed some tacos on our way out of austin and man am I glad   first  they re HUGE  like..well worth the money. second  the flavor was amazing  very cheesy  enough spice  and definitely filled me up. both salsas are always great if you love heat. the man who took our order was super friendly and the food came out under 10 mins even though quite a few people were already waiting. they have a great set up with multiple tables as well.
Granny's Tacos,323,This food truck is Delicious tacos  I had the veggie taco and it was very filling. Their salsa is fresh and went well with my taco. Service was great. There is a nice shaded seating area outside of the food truck. There are meters for parking nearby. Will definitely be by for more 
Granny's Tacos,324,Ever since discovering this little gem  I never skip it when im in town. It has that authentic Mexican taste and everything on their menu is great  The prices are cheap  their burritos are massive  amp  their salsa roja is fire  if your a fan of spicy .
Granny's Tacos,325,Best breakfast tacos I ve ever had in Austin. The variety is really good and the servings are enough to keep you really full with just 2 tacos although they are so good you ll keep wanting more. My husband and I really LOVE this place  every time we go there s a wait but it is well worth it so make sure you are not in a rush to eat. Armando is really good at taking care of his customers and always has a very good attitude which makes you want to come back.  We found them through yelp and were not disappointed at all  the reviews are very true.  My favorite tacos are  The ranchero taco and the chilaquiles-mole taco both in corn tortilla. I ve also tried the chilaquiles-verde taco and it is really good. My husband likes the Abuela taco too but we both agree that the mole and ranchero are the best so far. The salsas are also really good and even though I haven t tried any other of the tacos I m pretty sure everything there is good.   Excellent in every single aspect.  Definitely a MUST try.
Granny's Tacos,326,Damn good tacos  I ordered the bean  egg and cheese   2.50    cactus  egg   2.50  and cheese. Both were excellent. Not greasy yet still full of flavor. Both tastes fresh with great ingredients. Not sure what cheese was in with the cactus and egg but it was delicious  not your typical yellow cheese . Highly recommend and I will be back again    Plus they have several picnic tables outside of the truck with some umbrellas so you can eat there or take to go.
Granny's Tacos,327,What a GEM hidden me and my son grabbed lunch on Good Friday and were amazed. Taco truck by kabobolicous that is turning out amazing tacos FRESH  flavorful and so good  Great picnic tables with umbrellas and   Another great spot on the Eastside 
Granny's Tacos,328,A small but tidy food truck with absolutely delicious breakfast tacos. I had the chilaquiles taco and a bacon taco  and I wanted to cry with how delicious they were  cry because I m just visiting and can t eat them every day . They offer 3 salsa sauces to add yourself and all three bring both heat and flavor  which was delightful. Patio style seating with picnic tables means you can eat your tacos hot. I d come back and I think you won t be disappointed if you choose this spot for tacos
Granny's Tacos,329,That taco was perfection  Tortilla was WOW  chewy and soft and flavorful  The stuff inside  BURSTS of flavor  I had the breakfast taco with egg cheese potato and chorizo. It was so good  I d go back again  We also got Al Pastor taco  that pineapple taste and juicy meat    Outdoor picnic table seating. Didn t take long to order  we got there 9 55am sat   waited 15 min for taco  seems to be the standard for taco trucks here  .
Granny's Tacos,330,The BEST tacos and the Al pastor quesadilla is exceptional. Incredible kind service to top it off. Granny s is a must 
Granny's Tacos,331,Had a shrimp quesadilla and was pleasantly surprised with how good it was.  First  it was HUGE. Unbelievably filling  had me almost rolling myself along the road.  It took about 20 minutes  which is odd for a food truck  but was well worth the wait.  The salsa  sour cream and avocado that came with it perfectly complimented the dish at hand.  Definitely stop by here whenever you can 
Granny's Tacos,332,It s 5 starts for a reason people. EVERYYTHING on the menu is perfection. Anywhere from the loaded with flavor veggie taco  which I get EVERY time  to their loaded up Torta to even their hand made corn tortillas..you WILL be craving their food later. Their salsas are also beautifully done. Service is almost always fast  even if it s not it s HELLA worth waiting for .   I crave their tacos way too frequently and I m their  1 fan. Authenticity at its finest.
Granny's Tacos,333,The breakfast tacos   handmade corn tortillas are amazing  It was so good we had to come back the next day
Granny's Tacos,334,My boyfriend  amp  I just flew into Austin and this was the first place we visited to eat since arriving  I LOVE some good authentic Mexican and let me tell you this place is arguably the best I ve ever had. They give you complimentary unique hot sauces and salsa  which were fabulous . I get full insanely fast and usually can t eat a whole lot but I was able to take down two tacos and a quarter of my boyfriends burrito  AMAZING job Granny s Tacos  We ll never pass this up coming back to Texas  
Granny's Tacos,335,All I can say is DAMN    This little unassuming food truck is cranking out some excellent tacos...and not the little overpriced street tacos you see so often. Freshly made tortillas with a heap of filling that is loaded with truckloads of flavor. Everything is made fresh and is cranked out  in terms of food truck time  is pretty quick. Granny also has fresh salsas and sauces to top these masterpieces. Little hint...they are right off of 7th on the corner...little white Ford food truck.
Granny's Tacos,336,Just good ol  fashioned street tacos.Excellent carne asada  and   breakfast tacos. They cook with good fats and butter and the taste is wonderful. If you a calorie counter  or vegan don t bother stopping. This is good food   not for the faint of heart  yes intended . Next time we re in Austin I m going back  Only wish they deliver to Houston 
Granny's Tacos,337,Granny s has quickly become my go-to spot in Austin for Tacos. The crew that runs the food truck is awesome and really helpful when trying to decide what to order. My favorite is the abuela taco...the pork is just indescribably delicious. You can t go wrong with the Campechano  Alambre  or shrimp taco either.   The quesadillas here are HUGE and really tasty also just FYI. Don t ever change  Granny 
Granny's Tacos,338,Best taco I have ever had  Chicken mole was to die for. Cactus and egg was delightful as well  but that mole sauce is special. Haven t been back since we started the taco tour  but that was by far the best taco I have had.
Granny's Tacos,339,Wow. Best tacos of our entire visit to Austin. Veggie options galore. We went for breakfast  the broccoli and veggies were just so delicious. My daughter loved her bacon and potato. The tortillas were really good. Enjoy ya ll 
Granny's Tacos,340,Perfect Al Pastor tacos. I got mine with corn tortillas. They are obviously handmade and delicious. The man that took our order was very kind in explaining what things were  I don t know much Spanish . The Mexican cokes are huge. The dining area is big and clean. Love taco trucks so much. Definitely will go back when we are in the area.
Granny's Tacos,341,Flat out great tacos   Everything was hot  fresh and exactly what I needed. I took them to customers and they raved about them. That is unusual in Austin since you know there are a ton of places serving breakfast tacos   I will definitely come back.
Granny's Tacos,342,This place is incredible. Let me start by saying there are a ton of taco places in Austin  so the competition is stiff. I m not a huge fan of mol  in general  but I always order what is recommended in the reviews  even if it doesn t sound too appealing to me. I ordered the chicken mol  taco  and the migas taco. The mol  was my favorite and was the best mol  I ve ever had. The migas was delicious  and HUGE. My husband had the chilaquil and the abuela. Both delicious  but the chilaquil was the winner of the two  believe it or not. This place has got to be in the top five taco places in the city. I can t wait to return 
Granny's Tacos,343,Super fresh and delicious  Highly recommend. Puts a taco from Tacodeli to shame  frankly. And  I pretty much  love that place. Granny s is on a whole other level  for sure. Much more of a home-cooked vibe.
Granny's Tacos,344,These guys are the best. Cost effective  homemade and delicious. I go at least twice a week. The 25 minute drive is worth it for me. Support your local businesses and go downtown and get the best breakfast taco in Austin 
Granny's Tacos,345,Austin is known for their tacos - end of story. There are a lot of establishments cranking out  the best taco ever  is this small big town.   Trust me when I say these are the BEST tacos I ve ever had. From the freshly made tortilla to the crunchy chips inside the taco to the best mole sauce I ve ever had in my life topping the taco - BLISS  Granny and Armando are the friendliest people I ve met in quite sometime and you can feel their welcome the moment you walk up. I ve ever had them sit with me and chat while I eat their magical taco creations  Can you say chilaquiles    Situated next to Franandos  BOTECO  and the Vintage Heart coffee shop - there is something for everyone. Do yourself a favor and try these tacos.  My previous taco stop was Veracruz All Natural but these blew Veracruz out of the water.   I ve ever had a friend from Mexico City tell me she hadn t had tacos this good since Mexico 
Granny's Tacos,346,Delicious  Top 5 taco spots in Austin. They have the BEST green salsa.   We visited Granny s tacos today to pre-taco before the Taco Libre festival. Not one taco we had at the entire festival held a candle to Granny s. So glad we came here first to satisfy our delicious taco craving 
Granny's Tacos,347,This is one of the delicious dishes - cheap winter is indispensable.  Imagine on a cold  windy day  holding a hot bowl of porridge filled with flax and shrimp  add a little pepper to add a warm  rich taste  porridge is both smooth and fragrant  inviting people to eat until the last piece  .  Just eat you just watch the street watching the street  inhale the cool air typical of the monsoon days  feel the warmth spreading from the tip of the tongue to the whole body when eating each piece of porridge  ... coffee  Very always.
Granny's Tacos,348,This was really incredible. Even when it was raining out it was more than worth waiting for. We had one of almost everything on the menu between our group  and it was all excellent. Also quite cheap and fast  definitely recommended if you re looking for tacos.
Granny's Tacos,349,Muy bueni.  Just had the chirizo  egg  potato y cheese .  Git  2nds I enjoyed the first one soooooo much  
Granny's Tacos,350,Oh. My. GOD   I had an unforgettable taco experience at Granny s called a chilaquiles taco. The taco starts with chilaquiles made with the salsa of your choice cooked to crispy perfection. Those are placed in a soft  hot tortilla  also of your choice  then topped with shredded chicken  crumbled cotija cheese  diced onions  and a pickled jalapeno. Boom  Flavor explosion  I tried all 3 of the salsas  and I recommend the green salsa because of its bright tomatillo flavor balanced with a warm  savory  smooth garlic and chicken broth flavor. I also recommend getting a corn tortilla  I m pretty sure it s home made.  I had another taco  the abuela. I remember it being good  but I clearly don t remember it well since I remember it having steak and avocado while the menu clearly says it has chicharron and egg. I also tried la gringa  and I regret ordering it. It s basically a gourmet crunch wrap without the crunch. Sure  it was full of cheesy goodness with plenty of flavorful meat and vegetables  but the tacos are so much tastier in my opinion.  If I ever have the pleasure of returning to Austin  I will be sure to get 3 life-changing chilaquiles tacos and wash it down with a Topo Chico at Granny s Tacos. I know that I ll regret ordering anything else.  In case I wasn t clear  C H I L A Q U I L E S   T A C O S
Granny's Tacos,351,The food here is SIMPLE VERY AUTHENTIC   LOCAL  FRESH   ANYTHING U ORDER ... will satisfy ur craving for authentic local Austin food trucks   Must stop in even for a very popular breakfast tacos  2.50 each
Granny's Tacos,352,After extensive field research  I feel confident in saying that I ve found the best taco place in Austin. It took a while for us to make the trek to the food truck in East Austin  but oh man  was it ever worth it.  For starters  there s a solid selection of tacos available. And the gentleman running the truck  Armando  is passionate about their food  and it shows. Asked for his suggestions  and got a tour of the menu. We settled on a pair of breakfast tacos  a chilaquiles  and a shredded pork and avocado.   Now  I m not generally a corn tortilla person  but if I can give one tip  get the corn tortillas. Hand-made to order  they take the tacos to the next level.  Prices are totally fair   2.50-3.50ish a pop   the flavors are all on point  didn t even need salsa on the breakfast tacos   and the folks running the truck are a joy.   Next time you re craving tacos  or want to show off why tacos are a staple food in Austin  make a point to swing by. Simply sublime.
Granny's Tacos,353,Thad breakfast tacos of course. They were good  but could use just a little something more. I would eat there again though  Has a cute little area to eat right in front of the truck. Be careful of the black birds  if you leave your food alone for even a second  they will help themselves to it 
Granny's Tacos,354,This place literally has the BEST tacos in Austin   super friendly staff and a sanitary place   also the food is all fresh which is a big plus  
Granny's Tacos,355,mouth watering flavors. the al pastor is super bomb. i can eat these tacos everyday    
Granny's Tacos,356,Found myself here 3 times this week. The green chilaquiles tacos are the fucking bomb  Chicken torta is pretty good as well. This spot is a must if you re in the area. The lunch rush here is serious business. I usually call in my order
Granny's Tacos,357,this place was so good. the tacos  i got two abuelas  were absolutely amazing and the staff was super nice. i will definitely be coming back here and i can t wait to try their breakfast tacos.
Granny's Tacos,358,Best breakfast tacos I ve ever had  The salsas were incredible. Rancheros was my favorite  but will definitely go back to try some more. The owner was so sweet as well  Enjoyed the Christian music playing.
Granny's Tacos,359,Chorizo breakfast taco was delicious... but it wasn t 30-minutes wait in the sun whilst watching the people who ordered after you get their order and finish their food- delicious.  30 minutes for 2 tacos  one with basic ingredients  seems excessive.
Granny's Tacos,360,I don t do Yelp reviews. But after trying the machaca and the mole taco I was compelled. Currently have a chorizo  egg n cheese and a potato egg n cheese taco left. I m sure they are delicious but def get the mole and machaca you will not be disappointed. I don t have a picture because I ate them too soon.
Granny's Tacos,361,Holy crap this is a fantastic taco stand.  We went there on an hour lunch break in between classes because our buddy had seen the reviews.  The funny part is I was initially pretty unhappy with them because they are...not....fast.  We waited a long time for our food and ended up being late getting back to class.  I totally was thinking  how does this place have a 5 star rating   I tried my food.  5 stars.  Unequivocally 5 stars.  These are hands down the best tacos I ve ever had in any US State  including California where I grew up.  Their food manages to be original while hitting all the right classic taco truck notes.  A close second to the awesomeness of their food is the homemade salsas they have chilling in the cooler by the window.  I tried  and loved  all of them.  These guys took 35 mins to make me 3 tacos and I was late for class.  No doubt in my mind they deserve 5 stars.  That should tell you how good they are.
Granny's Tacos,362,This place is really good. I see why they are 5 stars. Probably some of the best  if not the best  tacos I have had in Austin and I ve been here 15 years now. Well done.
Granny's Tacos,363,I m giving this place four stars because the owner was so kind and patient when taking our order. We ordered 2 chilaquil tacos and I asked them not to include cheese because I wasn t sure it was pasteurized. I was so excited because they make them the true Mexican way  Chicken  salsa  homemade tortilla chips  queso fresco and crema Mexicana. To my disappointment both my tacos were covered in cheese     they also had a really strange seasoning in them that I was unable to get by. My husband ordered the ranchero taco and tacos and the granny taco... he wasn t impressed either. I wanted to love this place but it just wasn t for us.
Granny's Tacos,364,Amazing tacos. I love it here  This has to be the most delicious taco truck in Austin by far.
Granny's Tacos,365,probably the best tacos ive had in my life  i had grandmas and the breakfast ranchero one. Very random stop  very satisfied. coffee next door is good as well
Granny's Tacos,366,Fresh veggie ingredients with beautifully seasoned meat.  The truck is well stocked with napkins  various salsas  water  utensils  handwipes and sanitizer.  The wait was a little long  but worth it.  I wished I lived in Austin so I could go here every week.
Granny's Tacos,367,Granny s tacos are legitimately on the running for best tacos in Austin. Each taco is expertly crafted yet still a great value. What I love most about this place is that you can tell everything is high quality  from the salsas to the corn tortillas.   Speaking of tortillas do you yourself a favor and get any taco on corn. You ve never had a corn tortilla like the ones here. Additionally  they use nopales in their tacos which is not something you ll see often around Austin.   In a city inundated with great taco places  granny s tacos elevates itself above the rest.
Granny's Tacos,368,This taco truck is everything one could possibly want from a taco truck in Austin. I was directed here by the fine folks at Texas Coffee Traders  when I asked for a  heady taco spot within walking distance.  East Austin is seeing similar growth to the rest of the city  but this taco truck isn t a recent hipster addition  rather  it s a family-owned spot that serves a delicious variety of authentic tacos. I had three  which I unfortunately can t remember exactly  it was a couple of weeks ago   but the corn tortillas  homemade salsa  and taco fillings were delicious.   If you re in Austin and have an afternoon off  definitely head over to Granny s and get at least three tacos. You won t regret it 
Granny's Tacos,369,If you are in Austin or live in Austin and you don t go here you are a complete fool.   The mole chilaquiles taco is quite possibly the best taco I ve ever had.   Also the broccoli  egg and cheese breakfast taco was surprisingly good  as was the chorizo egg and cheese.  Handmade flour tortillas are delicious. Will try the corn next time.
Granny's Tacos,370,I go to granny s tacos food truck every weekend and it never disappoints. Every taco from this place is amazing and the  only  downside is how popular it is -- I would recommend ordering online in advance so you don t have to wait in line. The staff are great as well  Definitely grab some of their home made salsas before you go - enjoy 
Granny's Tacos,371,Seriously some of the most delicious tacos I ve ever had  I got the abuela taco   the ranchero taco and I loved both of them equally. The portions are great for the price and service was excellent   fast. It was a little busy when I went but we still managed to find a nice table to sit at. Will most definitely be returning 
Granny's Tacos,372,Absolutely amazing  I m from Austin and these are definitely some of the best tacos in Austin 
Granny's Tacos,373,Ridiculously good tacos from very sweet people. They ran out of corn tortillas by the time we got there  but the tacos and filling were so good that it didn t even matter. Strongly recommend the Mole Chilaquil taco.
Granny's Tacos,374,Granny s Tacos is simply amazing  You really can t go wrong with whatever you order  every is fresh an delicious.
Granny's Tacos,375,Delicious      I stumbled across this taco truck before meeting a friend for coffee and I am so glad I did  I had a bacon egg cheese breakfast taco  which was great  But...the key is the homemade salsas.   So fresh and flavorful. I will have to make a return trip to the east side just for tacos 
Granny's Tacos,376,FINALLY  ESTA MILAGRO GRANDE  My husband and I had pretty much given up on finding good Mexican food in Houston and didn t think we d find a good authentic place in all of Texas besides El Paso  at this point. This is a serious matter for us since my husband s Mexican American and we have never had bad Mexican food while growing up in southern California. Stopped here for breakfast this morning and this was my first time not being disappointed by so-called  Mexican  food in Texas. I ordered the Chilaquiles Mole taco and the cactus  egg  and cheese taco. My husband ordered the Hayley bowl. Everything was so delicious and wonderfully actually Mexican food and in the case of the bowl great Mexican fusion. It was in no way Tex Mex crap  We would ve immediately ordered more if we both weren t so full. Muchas gracias por todo Granny s Tacos 
Granny's Tacos,377,Granny s is the spot to get the best tacos in Austin. The abuela and the rico are must try s. The tortillas are so fresh and delicious. The tacos are pretty big so you ll want two if you re pretty hungry. It s a wonderful family run spot  and granny is there making the tacos   I can t say enough good things about it. What s also awesome is they have plenty of shade.
Granny's Tacos,378,Best tacos I ve had in Austin. Great customer service as well. Had the al pastor  la abuela and the campechano. Delicious  All very authentic flavors but the campechano takes the cake.
Granny's Tacos,379,Great breakfast tacos  I had the chorizo and the bacon breakfast tacos. Amazing  The salsa is phenomenal as well.
Granny's Tacos,380,Haley Bowl was really good  Eggs  avocado  bell peppers  onions  potatoes  broccoli  spinach and cheese. Their chips and salsa I would also recommend  Big portions  
Granny's Tacos,381,So good. I just got hip to Granny s and this is now my low key taco spot. Hipsters and tourists  please give them your business  but don t make me wait an hour for a burrito or I ll kill you all.
Granny's Tacos,382,Delicious    We went to Granny s Tacos for breakfast and ended up ordering nearly the entire menu    Must gets  - Haley Bowl  absolutely delicious and hearty yet so healthy  - bacon  egg  cheese breakfast taco  you can t go wrong with this one  highly recommend trying with some of the sauces  adds a little heat  - ranchero taco    Everyone who works there is so so nice  The lady supposedly makes homemade corn tortillas too  To try next time   
Granny's Tacos,383,Enjoyed the chillaquiles and abuela tacos.  Outdoor seating is plentiful while everyone stares at their phones  hopefully reviewing this place on yelp .  They definitely make the tacos fresh as this place tries your patients on waiting for a delicious taco.
Granny's Tacos,384,Great prices  quick  large amount of food  and SO YUMMY   My go to is the migas taco and chorizo  egg  amp  cheese.
Granny's Tacos,385,I literally just had a BEC breakfast taco in flour and knew this place was golden. The tortilla was made fresh and had the right amount of crunch. bacon was so good and the cheese they used was so meaty and gooey and UGH need this every weekend. Great food truck spot too on the Eastside with some benches. Cheap bfast tacos too  
Granny's Tacos,386,The tacos were not only good  but overflowing with meat  The burritos were amazingly delicious 
Granny's Tacos,387,Great food   Ordered 1 and ordered another to go   All three of us loved the tacos.  I got the veggie.
Granny's Tacos,388,Yum  I got a chicken taco and a fajita taco. The total was  6.50 w o tip. The chicken was cooked perfectly but the beef fajita was certainly the winner of the two. Their corn tortillas are homemade and you can definitely taste the authenticity. I will definitely come back next time I m next door at Vintage Heart Coffee.   Tip  If you order to go  eat them ASAP. They re deliciously juicy and can get soggy quick.
Granny's Tacos,389,Great lil truck recommended by local East Austin ers. The ice cold salsa is really special. Dont be shy. Great slice of Austin cuisine and food scene IMO. You can taste the love.
Granny's Tacos,390,I came because of the yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. I ordered the gringa at 7 in the morning and didn t have time to eat it until 9pm at night. And just saying  I would ve given a 5 star review  for the 14 hour later cold version of the gringa. The t o who took my order was super nice and friendly. It was the only meal I  bought in Austin  i was only there for 1 day  and I m delighted that it was. I m so sad they re not in California    10 out of 10 I recommend.
Granny's Tacos,391,Granny s Tacos is life changing. All of the taco s I ve tried are excellent and the chilaquiles taco is extra special. Staff is always super nice 
Granny's Tacos,392,If my granny made tacos like these I probably would visit more often. The flavors  the filling  the food coma. 2 tacos was enough to leave you completely full. Recommending chicken mole and the ranchero tacos  add a little salsa for an extra spice and i might just have found my new favorite spot.
Granny's Tacos,393,My favorite spot for breakfast tacos in Austin. Right next to Revival coffee  which is a plus 
Granny's Tacos,394,Granny knows tacos   Last time I came to Austin  I was introduced to Torchy s.  Granny s surpassed it.  Their tacos are tasty and inexpensive. I got the egg and spinach  al pastor  amp  carne guisado.  Each taco was better than the next.  The eggs were seasoned with just enough salt while the al pastor was sauteed in a slightly spicy red sauce.  I got a refreshing Watermelon juice made with fresh watermelon.  They offer a Mango drink as well but these beverages are not advertised on the menu so make sure to ask. Dislike  I went on a Saturday morning and there were 6 other people there.  I placed my order at 9 55am and got my food at 10 45am.  I witnessed 2 people before me ask when their food would be ready.  I would have rated Granny s a 5 star rating if it wasn t for the  long wait
Granny's Tacos,395,Was looking for a good taco lunch on the East side and came upon Granny s here on Yelp. My son-in-law and I tried a variety and I have to say the Chllaquilles with Mole Sauce was the winner  they were all good . Their sauces are also very good and compliment the flavors of the tacos. This is a real deal Mom and Pop trailer with great food and fair prices...you will be happy you came.
Granny's Tacos,396,Amazing  Abuela Taco  full of flavors  Burrito is so good got my husband quiet until he finish eating. At the end he say  this is the best burrito ever eat in my life . So friendly people and great prices 
Granny's Tacos,397,had to wait 45 minutes. was adv will take 25 minutes. food was salty and oily. had the al pastor tacos. gas station taco place is way better. will never go to Granny s ever   
Granny's Tacos,398,So good  Just got back from having two amazing tacos and I m in food coma heaven. The guisada taco was chicken  So no guilt on my low cholesterol diet. The corn tortillas and salsa are home made. And the proprietor is super friendly  They were quick  which was great because I was hungry.   Also  several picnic tables with umbrellas for shade were clean and on a comfortable patio area.
Granny's Tacos,399,Wow. Where to start - hands down  some of the best tacos I ve ever tasted. The tortillas are so fresh  the meat so tender and flavorful  all ingredients cooked to perfection. The mole sauce is outstanding  the owners are nice  and the salsas are fresh and delicious. It doesn t get much better than this folks
Granny's Tacos,400,Favorite tacos in Austin. Consistent- fresh- delicious- clean  amp  friendly. Gold star award for Granny s Tacos 
Granny's Tacos,401,Amazing food  genuine people. Warm smiles  warm conversation  and warm fresh tortillas. As an longtime Austin resident  we take BBQ and tacos very passionately here. The owners of Granny s put current taco contenders to shame. A new face to streets of Austin  Granny s creations are incredibly fresh and of high quality. Their corn tortillas are inexplicably delicious  fresh and light  and yet could almost be confused with flour. If you re looking for a menu recommendation  heads towards the chicken mole. A professional mix of grilled chicken  peppers  and mole sauce  so that neither flavor over compensates the others. Migas are your next stop  a packed breakfast blend which mixes perfectly with one of their three homemade salsas.   In summary  please don t visit this taco wunderkind mom n pop food truck...   Cause then I ll have to wait longer for my tacos.
Granny's Tacos,402,I have heard of these tacos finally made time to stop and this place was so good. i recommend if you haven t tried it you should and especially with the the corn tortilla.Yum i cant wait to go back.
Granny's Tacos,403,Best tacos I had in Austin   My favorites were the ranchero and the green chilaquile tacos.  We had the mole as well  which was also very good  I just tend to like green sauces better.  The man was very kind  but just FYI the food takes a while  so don t go when you re short on time.  We went at an off time post-lunch  so we were the only ones there  and it probably took 30 minutes between when my food was ready  and my friends  food.  I had breakfast tacos from Veracruz the next day  and they paled compared to Granny s 
Granny's Tacos,404,Downright delicious  traditional  homemade tacos. Absolutely must try. I had the veggie and chilaquiles w mole tacos two weeks ago and am still thinking about them. Mmmm 
Granny's Tacos,405,This place screams nostalgia for me through its food. The Rico taco took me back to my grandmother s kitchen. It is  by far  the best mole that I ve had outside of a relative s house. The rice inside the taco even had a slight lime flavor to it  which is how I prefer to eat my Mexican rice. Their al pastor  and the pork inside the Abuela taco truly taste like home. Even their green salsa tastes like the salsas that I grew up with. To those who cook here  you re doing amazing work. Don t ever stop.
Granny's Tacos,406,Armando s back. He took a leave of absence and had some wonky hours  but he told me this morning he s 8 to 3 Monday through Saturday  with some occasional weirdness for hours on Saturday  as I understood it .  I had a chorizo egg and cheese taco this time. Hell yes  my man. Trounces the other nuclear-punk chorizo taco I reviewed from a place up on Sixth. A FedEx guy walked up  looked at the menu and walked away like a chump. No idea what he s missing.  Such glowing prose  why 3 stars  Because I can.  Food s good. Eat it. Food s cheap. Buy it.  They also moved so no longer hidden by some wonky barbershop trailer. Now next to the brotastic hammock shop I refuse to name  at the corner of the alley and Navasoder.
Granny's Tacos,407,The only taco that is on par with Granny s is the suadero taco at Suerte. Delicious  friendly service  inexpensive  and right down the street from where I live  I will be making this a regular stop.
Granny's Tacos,408,Incredible tacos   The chorizo is delicious  high quality tortilla  salsa was just right. To top it off the tacos are well priced too  My new favorite taco place east austin. Oh and the music is great too 
Granny's Tacos,409,Get the chilaquiles tacos with green sauce. On occasion  I ask them to make me a breakfast burrito with eggs and bacon. Yum  amp  yum.
Granny's Tacos,410,MOLE CHILAQUILES TACO.   These tacos are amazing       The people working there are so friendly and the tacos are truly fantastic.  I love that the breakfast tacos have many vegetable options and the tortillas are perfect.   I hope granny s is successful.
Granny's Tacos,411,I had the shrimp quesadilla  which was hugeeee and greasy and perfect. My boyfriend had two veggie breakfast tacos  one with eggs and one with beans  he liked the bean one better. Delicious  fresh salsas  I took extra to go   Well cared for  casual covered seating area. Looking forward to eating my leftovers and coming back again 
Granny's Tacos,412,First off  such amazingly nice people running and cooking so already off the bat you know it s made with love  which truly does matter. Loved each taco more than the last. I would eat one and be like  this one is my favorite  then go to the next one and say  no  this one is my favorite   etc. So delicious. Go eat and enjoy  D
Granny's Tacos,413,Stone cold legit. A taco truck on a terraced lot with umbrellas and benches and run by a great Mexican couple  who couldn t be nicer . The tacos are fresh and the tortillas are handmade. Had the carne asada  al pastor  and the  Rico Taco   mole  rice and beans . To die for-- especially Rico Taco. Do yourself a favor and go try the best tacos in Austin  TX  
Granny's Tacos,414,Delicious and always fresh tasting. Granny s has some of the best weekday breakfast options in Austin. Breakfast tacos and the Haley bowl are my favorites. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. Overall a pleasant dining experience every time.
Granny's Tacos,415,Very good tacos. But torchy s prices  really   People from LA tell me food trucks with tacos average about two dollars there. What s up with the greedy prices 
Granny's Tacos,416,Best breakfast taco in Austin  Owners are very kind and helpful. Tacos are tasty  quick  and there are a lot of options. When choosing a taco stand in Austin  go here 
Granny's Tacos,417,Tremendous people making tremendous tacos. Both the green and red chilaquiles tacos cannot be missed. Hands down the best chilaquiles experience in town. Affordable  delicious and it will feel good to support the business of these wonderful people.
Granny's Tacos,418,This is all about authenticity and straight up deliciousness.  Give yourself a bit of time as this is not fast food but so worth the brief wait.  Gracias abuelita 
Granny's Tacos,419,Best of the best. Don t be fooled by the little ol truck on the outside. This place is bursting with amazing flavors and options. It s my go to 
Granny's Tacos,420,The Chilaquiles taco is delicious and unique. I m telling you  Chilaquiles with Red sauce is amazing. But everything is great. Probably my favorite taco place in Austin.
Granny's Tacos,421,Great place for breakfast  really nice help I had the potatoes  egg and cheese tacos twice
Granny's Tacos,422,Loved the freshly made tacos from this place  My favorite was the broccoli and egg taco but we also ordered the chorizo  potato and egg  bacon and egg and potato and egg. This place did not disappoint 
Granny's Tacos,423,Such delicious tacos  Simple menu and everything is so fresh. Definitely get corn tortillas  they re homemade. We tried the Abuela  Carne Guisada and chicken fajita. Also we re treated to fresh watermelon juice   So so good  
Granny's Tacos,424,Delicious tacos with unique combinations. I shared and the people who got the extra tacos told me they were the best they had eaten since forever. If you want nopales  chorizo  and homemade tortillas  this is the place 
Granny's Tacos,425,This place has a solid 5 stars  and by god they ve earned it. I went to give it a trial run and got a breakfast taco  pastor taco  and chicken taco. Each was some of the best I ve had in my 13 years in Texas. So good I bought another breakfast taco and a burrito. The burrito was as big as a Chipotle burrito. Still killed all of it and regretted nothing. I almost don t want to write this review because it ll tell more and more people about it and it ll make the lines longer  but I think this secret won t last long anyway. 6 stars if I could.
Granny's Tacos,426,Wow  I have ate alot of tacos in Austin. I was at the coffee shop rivelry and doing work. The truck is tight next door. So I looked on Yelp. Saw that they recommend the mole chiaquilles taco. I ordered it. One of the best 3.00 taco I have had in Austin. It could be because I love mole. So if you get a chance try it out. Was not to busy at 130 pm.
Granny's Tacos,427,Best tacos ever   These are so delicious because everything is homemade right on the spot.. just like it you had a Mexican abuela  The meats are so flavorful with fresh toppings  amazing sauces  and perfect hand made tortillas. Tacos just don t get better than these  The owner and his family are really nice and accommodating and give great recommendations too 
Granny's Tacos,428,I m not a big egg fan but this was the best I ever ate. The broccoli egg and cheese taco was AMAZING 
Granny's Tacos,429,Awesome taco truck on the east side. Only open from 7 AM -3 PM.   Tried 3 different tacos and they were fantastic. A little surprised they were served on flour tortillas.
Granny's Tacos,430,It s a cool spot  the tacos were ok  took a little long but the locals seem to like the owner. He s a hard working man  and he was very customer service friendly. As far as flavor it was just decent  it did the job for a breakfast taco
Granny's Tacos,431,So Pueblo Viejo is good for street tacos  but this little place tucked in next to Vintage Heart Coffee is AMAZING. Get the Carne Asada tacos and the Veggie Tacos with refried beans. Absolutely awesome. Plus they are open at hours when most trucks are closed. We visited at 3 00 on a Tuesday and they were more than happy to make us delicious food. The truck is run by a husband and wife team who are just awesome. So good. We ll most certainly be back.
Granny's Tacos,432,Freaking delicious  Authentic flavors. Outstanding chorizo in their dishes. Homemade tortillas. The chilaquiles breakfast tacos are to die for   I got the green 
Granny's Tacos,433,Amazing. I got the chilequiles tacos with green sauce and they were excellent. Everything was fresh. Salsa was spicy and flavorful. This place is awesome.
Granny's Tacos,434,The best tacos in Austin. Cactus breakfast taco is the best  Never thought I d like broccoli in a taco  but I do here. Also  the mole is out of this world  Can t go wrong with anything you order here. Guac and chips - muah 
Granny's Tacos,435,Wow.  What a great breakfast burrito.  Mom and pap vender were very pleasant and the tacos are on point   You gotta try the hot sauce.  I ll be back when I come Austin 
Granny's Tacos,436,My husband and I tried this taco truck today on a whim  and we were so happy we did. My husband asked the teen taking our order if they had a basic steak taco  and the guy turned to the woman cooking and said   Grandma  do we have a regular steak taco   All the feels. I thought it was adorable and wanted so badly for the tacos to be awesome so we could come back and support a family business....they did not disappoint   Fresh  loaded  delicious  The sauces are fantastic also. We got the chorizo taco and fajita steak taco and I m hooked. It s also conveniently located next to our favorite morning coffee spot  Vintage Heart .  Oh yeah  it s pretty cheap too... Cheap and free are my favorite words - 
Granny's Tacos,437,Just had some breakfast tacos at Granny s. I m just visiting from MSP but the chorizo egg cheese tacos were absolutely killer. Perfectly spiced  although I did add a little salsa from the lunch bucket. Very inexpensive and delicious. My wife had spinach egg cheese tacos and she too was knocked out. Any chance you guys could open a food truck in the Twin Cities  Please    
Granny's Tacos,438,We tried it based on searching by rating on yelp  and it was delicious and had super friendly owners. We will definitely be back  Tacos are big  both flour and corn tortillas are so good.
Granny's Tacos,439,Hubby and I scootered over here this morning. This may be the best breakfast taco I ve had. I got the potato  chorizo  egg  amp  cheese. It s absolutely delicious. And for the price- they are filled up. Also tried the cactus egg  amp  cheese - it was interesting but good. We will definitely be back. Highly recommended.
Granny's Tacos,440,Overall I ve been disappointed with the Mexican food in austin but granny s hits the mark   I highly recommend the chilaquiles tacos  mole or red sauce - both are excellent  and the breakfast taco with broccoli was very good.  I also highly recommend their salsas  lots of flavor but not too spicy.    Only complaint is the breakfast taco with lots of different veggies  it had lots of grilled green peppers which I wasnt crazy about but everything else is excellent.
Granny's Tacos,441,Very good   I was debating between a four and a five.  We had breakfast tacos and some normal meat tacos.  I really liked breakfast tacos.   I personally thought the meat tacos were good  but a bit greasy  not too bad   but my partner thought they were amazing  and thought that was what made them so good.  They all had generous toppings.  The wait was a bit long  but still reasonable.  They guy in the trailer was super nice and even specially thanked up for coming by after we were done.
Granny's Tacos,442,Best Breakfast tacos I have ever eaten. Ever. In any city. In any country. Made by anybody s grandmother or otherwise. Best. And the owner is the nicest dude in the world if you sit and chat with him a little bit  I got a chance to because I was the only one there on a cold weekday morning.  But when word gets out  this thing place is going to be packed like Franklin s. They have a really welcoming little courtyard with about five picnic tables  big green shrub. Little succulent plants everywhere. Just the coolest  man.
Granny's Tacos,443,Do yourself a favor and just try it.. super seasoned to perfection.. customer service was also A1
Granny's Tacos,444,Had high expectations going in  but left disappointed. Granny s has a great selection but the wait is incredibly long for how few ingredients are in each taco. The tacos are good but nothing special  you can find much better at most gas station parking lot taco trucks.
Granny's Tacos,445,Quality of the food is really good. They should hire an assistant to speed up the process. That was my only complaint. Breakfast tacos on point 
Granny's Tacos,446,Very high quality   I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was amazing.  Great flavors  chicken was cooked perfectly and not to mention it was huge   So nice and friendly too.  I ll definitely be back.
Granny's Tacos,447,The best tacos we had in Austin. Worth the wait and the drive. My husband had the La Gringa  which was huge and delicious  and the potato  chorizo  egg and cheese taco. I had the ranchero and chilaquiles taco. Both were great but the chilaquiles with mole was the star. Soooooo good.
Granny's Tacos,448,Some cons  sometimes the wait can be long  so steer clear if you see lots of people waiting.
Granny's Tacos,449,Great little truck. Really warm people serving delicious food. My first visit included two tacos al pastor and one carne asada. The al pastor was good--not my ideal  but solid--but the carne asada was great.  Will definitely be coming back here regularly.
Granny's Tacos,450,Great Tacos  Overloaded Breakfast Tacos.... mine with eggs  refried beans   amp  bacon  and the second with Chorizo  beans   amp  egg.   Super friendly Granny at the window who was eager to please. I love Austin and food trucks  This is an Authentic Mexican food truck with tacos made with the love. This place holds up to the select few that I frequent. This will now be on my weekly rotation. Love  love  love  Granny and her Tacos 
Granny's Tacos,451,Convinced six of my classmates to come here based on the good reviews  and it made our day. Best taco I ve had in a long time. Get the Abuela and the Mole Chilaquiles Taco  All my buddies were happy with the Abuela  the Chilaquiles  and the Gringa.  Those of us who chose corn tortillas were super impressed. Only drawback was it took a while to cook  but in her defense  Abuela had around 20 tacos to cook for all of us  I am gonna come back in sweat pants and eat until I bust.
Granny's Tacos,452,This taco stand is worth the walk if you are staying near the convention center. Breakfast tacos are just amazing- and the fresh salsa kept in the cooler on the side of the truck is a great touch.
Granny's Tacos,453,Came to Austin on vacation and was brought here by some family because they talked it up and it did not disappoint  The great smells hit you as soon as you walk up. Home made tortillas and salsas were the icing one the proverbial taco cake. Definitely try the chilaquiles tacos 
Granny's Tacos,454,The best breakfast tacos I ve ever had   We walked all the way from downtown because of all these great reviews and they re completely true. Such a nice couple and REALLY good tacos.
Granny's Tacos,455,One of the best tacos in Austin. Can t go wrong with the Chilaquil taco with green sauce one of my favorites. Excellent customer service
Granny's Tacos,456,The Greatest Tacos I ve had    Great Customer service    Made me drive back for another Chilaquiles Taco   If Your In Austin I Recommend You Stop By 
Granny's Tacos,457,This place is the real deal for Pastor Tacos.  They re the best I ve had in Texas.   I think they re only open during lunch hours though  so plan ahead.
Granny's Tacos,458,Ran by a friendly couple  Granny s Taco serves delicious Mexican food for reasonable prices. They even have mole  a kind of brown sauce that s difficult to find even in Austin s expansive taco scene. My favorite thing to get is the chilaquiles taco with mole  There s outdoors seating and some convenient parking next to it. The wait time is a little long  but you can chill at the nearby Vintage Hearts Coffee Shop while waiting 
Granny's Tacos,459,I had two tacos here for the first time today and was beyond impressed. I grew up in Southern California and visited family in Mexico every year so I know authentic tacos and ingredients when I taste them. I m a corn over flour guy till I die so if you re one of those Tex mex chuy s dumpster divers you might not appreciate the lack of quesooo on these incredible tacos. First one I had the pleasure of eating was the chilaquiles taco with mole  onion  chicken  and Mexican cheese on a homemade corn tortilla. 5 stars. One of those tacos that s so good it brings back childhood memories and all the sights and sounds that come along with it.  The next is the Abuela Taco with shredded pork  adobo sauce  pico  and avocado. Similar to an al pastor but way better than any al pastor taco I ve ever had. 5 stars. They ve barely been open a year and this place is currently the best kept secret in austin. Come here now before you have to wait forever to snag a taste of this gift from the taco gods.
Granny's Tacos,460,Great bean breakfast taco and the man working the window was very nice. Thanks for making our morning delicious.
Granny's Tacos,461,Heard about it while in Kerrville at the Folk Festival. Live in Austin  so I had to... Man    Been coming since. 10 10
Granny's Tacos,462,This place was amazing. I had a cactus taco and a couple of beef tacos. They were fresh and the salsa in the bucket was also fresh and tasty. There was a small but nice eating area set up with picnic tables. I went around 11am to beat a crowd and it was steady traffic but not overwhelming.
Granny's Tacos,463,Great  big tacos at a reasonable place  The authenticity is refreshing 
Granny's Tacos,464,This place is unbelievable. Highly recommend that you visit this while in Austin. Best breakfast tacos I ve ever had 
Granny's Tacos,465,Thank you. Just thank you. Worth every penny. Just don t plan to do anything else that day as wait times are a little excessive. Properly worth it though.
Granny's Tacos,466,HOLY CRAP. GO GO GO GO GO. If you re contemplating eating here. Just go and do it. I ordered 2 Ranchero Tacos and I m still dreaming of them. Boyfriend ordered a burrito and a Mexican Coke. It was so delicious. I wanna set up a tent right outside of the food truck. Quick drive from downtown Austin  totally worth it. Perfect food amount to hen go tubing down the river.
Granny's Tacos,467,Awesome tacos. Everything tastes fresh and is done right. Pretty sure they gone make their tortillas too  Skip torchys  come here for authentic  
Granny's Tacos,468,Tacos are so delicious and fresh. The service is really quick and the outdoor patio is shaded so it s not too hot when there s a breeze. I ordered the abuela and Rico taco. Highly recommended  
Granny's Tacos,469,Just had their Migas tacos  best Migas tacos in town. The green jalape o sauce with it is majestic. Very fresh  tasty with the uncommon sour cream in their also. Love it 
Granny's Tacos,470,Delicious  I had the La Gringo with Pastor. Wow  If you have the chance you should check it out.
Granny's Tacos,471,Perfect breakfast taco experience--get the habanero salsa. Best breakfast tacos in Austin  Turkey sausage and chorizo tacos are both AMAZING. Would eat here for LITERALLY every breakfast if possible. Also maybe lunch and dinner.
Granny's Tacos,472,This taco truck was out of this world   LOVED it   The carne guisada was particularly delicious. Also  their salsas are so good   Just the right amount of spice in the red and green ones. I ll be back again soon for sure 
Granny's Tacos,473,Seriously the best breakfast tacos in Austin. I ve been here a few times and I keep going back. Home made everything  kind service and funky location. I highly recommend 
Granny's Tacos,474,Our favorite taco spot in Austin--with Vintage Heart aka Revival Coffee  Vintage Heart forever  right next door what could be better  The quesadillas here are also super tasty.
Granny's Tacos,475,Excellent    I had 3 el pastor tacos and they were so delicious  also they are a pretty big size  I could have gone with only two but am not sad about having 3  The owners are super nice too 
Granny's Tacos,476,So nice you should hit it twice  for breakfast and dinner . Delicious  hand made corn tortillas and scrumptious fillings. We had the mole  sausage with egg  and a vegetarian taco. All were great. Very sweet husband and wife team makes tipping a no brainer. Definitely sample this fare. With love  from Philly.
Granny's Tacos,477,Food was fresh and delicious. The owner was super cool and excited about life. Those are the type of people I want to support. Granny s Tacos FTW 
Granny's Tacos,478,We went for breakfast on Saturday morning and would have gone again on Sunday had they been open. The chicken mole breakfast taco was my favorite of all the tacos we ate over a 4 day period in Austin. LOVED IT SO MUCH    I wish I had eaten 2  and am sad that I won t be back for who knows how long. This is definitely my recommendation in the future to any friends and family headed to Austin for Food Truck tacos  or any breakfast taco... YUMMY   
Granny's Tacos,479,AWESOME TACOS. Had the potato  chorizo  egg  amp  cheese  highly recommend. Adorable clean
Granny's Tacos,480,The tacos here are so good and they are stuffed with food. You really only need two tacos at a time  though I wish I was able to stuff in more. There is a delightful crunch in the Chilaquiles from the chips they add that makes it one of the best tacos I have ever had.
Granny's Tacos,481,Hidden gem. Grab a coffee from Vintage Heart and walk next door for some tacos. Medium-large serving  fresh ingredients  and excellent value.
Granny's Tacos,482,An underrated gem. Probably the best tacos I ve had in Austin  and I ve tried a lot of those places in the top 10 lists  most of them are just okay  or are very American . Their red chilaquiles are AMAZING. Would dine again 10 10
Granny's Tacos,483,Excellent breakfast tacos. Friendly service  and convenient parking make this place a go-to 
Granny's Tacos,484,Yummy  Worth the wait. I happily ate my entire 8 buck chicken quesadilla. Salsa  Avocado and tons of flavor. Filling. A solid lunch. Nice people. Habla espanol. GVM
Granny's Tacos,485,Best freaking tacos in Austin  I am a taco fanatic and granny s taco is easily one of the best tacos I have ever had  Armando is awesome and the tacos are good  what more could you ask for 
Granny's Tacos,486,Really good tacos  stopped while on road trip and very happy with the great food they have at Granny s Tacos  
Granny's Tacos,487,I was skeptical because i had to wait a long time for someone to take my order and once that happened  it still took 30 minutes. But i brought it home and WOW. We had the chilaquilas taco  a burrito and a quesadilla and we were super impressed. Just amazing   
Granny's Tacos,488,Best taco I ever had  I wish I could fit in one more trip there  but they close at 3 on Fridays.
Granny's Tacos,489,Descent breakfast tacos.  Had the bacon and egg  and spinach and egg.  Large portions.  Great corn tortillas.  Self-serve salsas weren t labeled.  One I grabbed was too hot  and one was too mild.
Granny's Tacos,490,I am speechless. This place is so underrated you have to give it a try  food is affordable and made with a lot of flavor and love
Granny's Tacos,491,Easily the best taco truck I ve seen since sineloa in Oakland. The chilaquile taco with mole sauce is to die for. I also had the asada burrito it was jus as spectacular
Granny's Tacos,492,Granny s Tacos  OMG - I ve been a loyal fan upon my first bite of that fateful chilalique taco with mole sauce. Although these tacos aren t yet the talk of the town  they are certainly jaw-droppingly mouth-watering and buzz-worthy  Their tacos are served fresh and you can taste the authentic love that went into making them... from the homemade corn tortillas  awesome array of veggies  yes  add that cactus or broccoli to your taco    and the salsas made with the perfect consistency and degree of spicy- orange-red habanero  lime green salsa verde  etc...Not to mention their MOLE sauce again... AH. the tacos are so special you can t resist licking your fingers after eating them with your hands. And  its a family-run joint. You can catch Granny s son eating a taco with his kids on a rainy day. And Granny and Armando are so in love  its inspiring to watch them alchemize their romance into taco making- the overall experience is uplifting. I know you guys might think I m weird. But I am weird. I love Granny.
Granny's Tacos,493,10 10 would recommend. Come here if you re looking for bangin  tacos and a chill outside atmosphere.
Granny's Tacos,494,In a city where tacos are plentiful  this taco truck makes a name for itself  The food is friendly  tasty  feels authentically  homemade and worth the price of roughly about  3 bucks a taco. The tacos are filling too  This is my first time trying this taco truck and I will certainly be back very soon WITH friends.
Granny's Tacos,495,The best breakfast tacos in East Austin. The people here are super friendly. I m glad more people haven t found this place because it s not usually crowded but it s DELICIOUS  My new favorite spot for breakfast.
Granny's Tacos,496,Best tacos eveeeerrrr. This place is amazing. Huge servings. Huge flavor. Great prices. Best food truck in Austin 
Granny's Tacos,497,Great tacos and very nice staff. Would visit again 
Granny's Tacos,498,Amazing amazing amazing. I ve lived in and out of Austin for twenty years  and these may be the best tacos I ve had yet - and the salsa is just as good. Go visit.
Granny's Tacos,499,This is my FAVORITE taco truck in all of Austin. And as a long time Taco Deli fan  this is a big deal. We ve been working next to Granny s for two weeks now and I think I ve had a taco every day. Maria and Hernando make delicious tacos every time - they are kind  genuine  and generous - big portions  always made to order. My favorite is the migas  broccoli y juevo  y chilaquiles con salsa verde. I can t recommend this place more  And the tortillas are so  so delicious.
Granny's Tacos,500,OMG    You will not regret it. seriously delicious and most tasteful mexican food. The people are very courteous and give great service. I ve visited tons of trailers in Austin and this is thus far the best I ve had. NOT tex-mex is authentic Mexican flavor.
Juan In A Million,1,I get the Don Juan with extra tortillas and no bacon  Reasonably priced.   The queso is very runny and too expensive for what it tastes like. Unfortunately  the free salsa is also very runny. Usually  queso and salsa are my favorite things but no bueno at this place.
Juan In A Million,2,SO GOOD SO MANY OPTIONS  GREAT PORTIONS    As busy as they were we still got in and ate in a timely manner. Great job to the staff   10 10 recommend 
Juan In A Million,3,Texas is known for their breakfast tacos  Juan is one of the top spots to get them.  Large restaurant. Super packed at 9 am on Saturday. Wait was about 15 minutes at this time.  Private parking lot  was full.   Friendly service. Ordered to go. Food took a bit to come out.  Don Juan El Taco Grande -  6.95 - HUGE  Probably 3 4 of a normal burrito in size. Lots of potatoes and super heavy. I could not finish mines. One and done for me  2 would have put me to sleep. Barbacoa -  4.50 - Meat was good and flavorful. No other toppings. I put my Don Juan and mixed it in to make a more loaded taco.
Juan In A Million,4,This place is good but I was expecting a little better considering there s always a line out the door  I had my hopes up for some really good Mexican food and I honestly thought it was just decent. We got an order of queso  large  which was really good and definitely too big for our party of 4. Their house salsa is much spicier than the average so be careful of that. I ordered chicken flautas which were tasty but nothing that wowed me. My friends chicken tacos were sad looking and very mediocre. I ve heard the breakfast tacos are what people go for so maybe we just got the wrong things  Anyway... queso is a must and flautas were good if you find yourself here 
Juan In A Million,5,This place is just alright. I feel like it was a bit overpriced too  two plates and 1 soda for almost  40. The food wasn t nasty  but it was really plain.
Juan In A Million,6,Yeah. OK. We ve been here several times. Food is great. Service is great. Everything is great.   Juan just refuse to believe my red haired Irish man speaks fluent Tejano.   It would be entertaining if it didn t add 20 minutes to checkout.  Gingers beware. Juan may have a fetish...
Juan In A Million,7,The hype is worth it  Super cute local taco spot that s perfect for breakfast brunch. When we went they had a special on mimosas  so it was the perfect Sunday morning brunch  Definitely get the breakfast special with potatoes - just be warned  the portions are huge  Go hungry or you ll have leftovers.
Juan In A Million,8,For a Saturday lunch we waited in a long line as expected. The wait was maybe 30 minutes thanks in part to plenty of seating. Food while good is nothing I d crave or go out of my way for. Liked their chips  complimentary with spicy salsa.    Humungous portions. Think Cheesecake Factory. My Chicken quesadilla was stuffed  easily two meals. Good shredded chicken to cheese ratio  easily two meals for me. The cilantro added freshness and lightened the food. I ve had better guacamole.  My friends enjoyed their food. Vegetarians have options here.  Prices are on par for the area.  Would go somewhere else for lighter Mexican but glad I ate here.
Juan In A Million,9,Juan in a million   This place is open early    Everything is bigger in Texas     Portions is great      We order the Don Juan- El Taco Grande   Over all 5 stars
Juan In A Million,10,Authentic and delicious breakfast Tex Mex tacos. It was our last day in Austin and I m happy to have enjoyed my last meal at Juan in a Million. There was a 15 min wait around noon on a weekday. The employees are quick and friendly - we even got to meet Juan who is a gem   My friend and I shared the Don Juan tacos and together  we ate around 3 4 of it  D. It s huge and very shareable. I loved the flavors of the bacon  cheese  potato  and eggs - a perfect breakfast combo  The horchata is HUGE and soooo refreshing with coconut milk 
Juan In A Million,11,Everytime I ve tried to come here  the wait time has always been too long for me to wait which means that this place is super popular. This time though  the wait was only 25min on a Sunday morning around 10 30am  Hooray  My entire party of 10 all ordered the Don Juan   6.75  which is one of their most popular menu items. It comes with a giant mixture of cheese  potatoes  eggs  and bacon on a tortilla. I m not sure exactly what other ingredients they put in to make it so good  but it doesn t taste like your typical breakfast taco.  I would order a few extra tortillas for  0.20 each to make smaller tacos. I also got a horchata   2.90  which was very refreshing.   This place has unbeatable value- a lot of us didn t finish our meal and had to take leftovers home. They also provide complimentary chips and salsa 
Juan In A Million,12,Delicious spot for breakfast tacos  Just be warned - the portion sizes of the food is pretty big  so plan accordingly lol. You definitely get bang for your buck here though   Each table gets a basket of chips and salsa  so that was nice to munch on while we decided what to order. I ordered the Don Juan el taco grande and chorizo with egg breakfast taco.   Once my plate arrived I was surprised at how big the Don Juan was  It was piled on with the egg cheese potato bacon mixture and came with a side of 3 extra tortillas. This was delicious but way too much food for me haha  I could only eat about half of it. I also really enjoyed the chorizo taco  the meat was flavorful and mixed well with the egg and cheese.   If I were to do it over  I d probably get the Don Juan to share with the table and then order a couple other breakfast items to try. But this is a great spot for a tasty Tex Mex breakfast 
Juan In A Million,13,Juan In A Million is a favorite place of mine ever since I was little. My family owned TexMex restaurants in Austin and always served chips and hot sauce at every table. This day and age  other TexMex restaurants throughout Austin either charge for chips and hot sauce  don t serve before a certain time or charge you when ask for an extra plate..  Not Juan. He keeps in old school and that s why this is my favorite TexMex place.  Hot sauce - SPICY  someone must be mad at someone back in the kitchen   Ha   So good  you just can t stop eating it. Just trying not to get full and save room for the Don Juan.  In an area where the cultural has shifted  it s good to see Juan In A Million sticking around.  As always. Great breakfast and impeccable service 
Juan In A Million,14,Came from California and didn t understand what the hype was about breakfast tacos but Juan in a million has converted me    We got the taco grande and shared with my friend. Yum   We got a side of carne guisada - good   Wait time was 30min on a Sunday around noon. Line moves fast  food comes out even faster
Juan In A Million,15,Wow   I understand why people are willing to wait to get these tacos. We weren t even hungry but after hearing how we must try this place  since we traveling from CA- we did. We did the famous breakfast taco.  8. You get A LOT of food for this  One taco . They suggested to buy a couple more tortillas  glad we did. We were about to make 3 breakfast tacos out of this. Enough for 2 people.   Service was very pleasant. The ladies at the front shared more areas to check out  we re patient with us s as we were looking around inside to.   Lots of seating. Food was delivered fast and hot. We took it to go for a walk around Lady Lake and ate it about an hour later- still warm and delicious
Juan In A Million,16,AMAZING breakfast tacos-- the steak in the fajita tacos were so tender and juicy and the chorizo potato combination was soooo good. Disappointed by their guac-- which was literally just mashed avocados with nothing else in it  but the tacos were too good for me to give this place less than 5 stars.
Juan In A Million,17,One of the cool things about Juan In a Million is it looks like it expanded into neighboring space when it became available. That s why there are random rooms and nonsensical seating in some spots.  It s not a bad thing. In fact  I think it adds to the charm.  Anyway  I stared at my menu for about ten minutes because I wasn t sure what I wanted. Finally  I asked my waitress what she would suggest.  CON QUESO BREAKFAST.  She didn t blink. Then she asked   How do you want your eggs    Over easy.   It s one of the best breakfast meals I ve eaten.  I highly recommend.
Juan In A Million,18,This place was awesome and exactly what I expected  Cheap  good Mexican food abundant. They have a large sized patio you can sit on and enjoy the day  good weather permitting.   We ordered the Horchata which was extremely generous in portion size  enough for 2 people to split easily . It was very tasty and sweet. They had other options for aguas frescas too.   I ordered the con queso breakfast which had  eggs  cheese  beans  rice and carne guisada. It was so delicious and filling. The meat was very tender and everything had plenty of flavor. My boyfriend got the chicken enchiladas  which he had no complaints about either.  Definitely would return here for some great Mexican food 
Juan In A Million,19,Never had an authentic Tex Mex breakfast before  so this was a treat for sure.   Parking is pretty spacious here  but this is a popular spot so you might want to get here early. If you can t  no worries though. Inside is a lot larger than it looks on the outside. There s tons of seating in multiple rooms. It s very well-staffed and everyone who works here is super nice   It s open for breakfast and lunch  but breakfast is where its at. Breakfast tacos are there specialty. And what s even better  It s super cheap here  Everything is affordable and you will not feel cheated here.   It was my first time here  so the waitress said I should try the Don Juan El Taco Grande. I know it says taco  but this is a giant meal in itself. So  I d recommend just ordering one as each taco actually comes with three large tortillas and a mountain of eggs  bacon  cheese  and potato. Very hearty dish  although to be honest I think they put too much potato and not enough egg. The accompanying salsa was very good.  Overall  really nice place for some Tex Mex breakfast. Go here for sure 
Juan In A Million,20,Inexpensive place to grab brunch and I must say it was quite delicious. The only thing I wish was that they give you a little bit more meat but the eggs were cooked perfectly. The tortillas are fresh and seem homemade while the service is quick and efficient. come try out this location institution for yourselves 
Juan In A Million,21,After constantly hearing all these rave reviews about this place  I finally had a chance to go downtown and try it. This restaurant is in the quickly gentrifying East Austin right next to La BBQ. Upon arriving  we were told the wait would be around 30-45 minutes. We ended up waiting around 20-25 minutes.  I ordered the small menudo and the Don Juan Taco Grande  both are on their recommended  and my friend ordered the Don Juan Taco Grande and another taco.  The menudo could be skipped and was not the great. The Don Juan was effectively 4 tacos worth of food. My friends other taco never arrived which was actually a godsend since we were already super stuffed from just the Don Juan Taco   6.95 . The price of the Don Juan Taco CANNOT be beat 
Juan In A Million,22,Very quick  amp  very polite people  this was my first time visiting and now they have found a loyal customer. I will be there at least twice a week. They make sure that the restaurant is the cleanest and most presentable. The food is amazing  hot well cooked  and they have a variety of tacos and other great things to choose from.
Juan In A Million,23,This place is a must have when we go to Austin  Try their carne guisada with QUESO instead of just cheese... you re welcome  
Juan In A Million,24,If your looking for the no frills taco spot known for huge portions and their very own taco challenge you have come to the right spot. This place definitely gets busy and I believe they do not do reservations so come early.   They have a taco challenge for the famous Don Juan which is one single taco that is one pound. Currently the record is 13.5 Don Juan s  held by a female  and the male contender is topped at 9.5 Don Juan s. The food comes out super fast as well. My Don Juan was pretty tasty  is it something I d come weekly to get...probably not. I think we had better breakfast tacos elsewhere.   The tres leches was good  not my favorite but still pretty solid. The service was also solid especially with the constant flow of customers. I d definitely recommend at least coming here once to give it a whirl  especially if you are a tourist.
Juan In A Million,25,Good food at great prices. The portion sizes are quite large for the price you pay  so based on value for money  alone  I d give five stars. Overall  the food doesn t blow me away  though. It s good  but you probably wouldn t choose this place simply based on the quality of the food.
Juan In A Million,26,Always love bringing people here. Solid breakfast options that will make you so full you ll want to roll out of the place. Friendly service  spicy salsa  and generally just a fun place to go with a group. Try the migas plate with cheese 
Juan In A Million,27,This is THE spot. Feels like home  the food is just so yummmmmmyyyy yummm yummmmmm. I m new here to Austin and this is now my comfort place. U will prolly see me eating here I usually take a booth they comfy. THEY MAKE THEIR FOOD WITH LOVE  you can taste it. MUCHAS gracias. I love this place. U should love it too. You re welcome  Xoxo  Gossip girl
Juan In A Million,28,I don t understand why this spot isn t 5 out of 5 stars     Great food   The Don Juan breakfast taco grande was epic     The service was unbelievable     We will return    Came all the way from Phoenix to try their breakfast taco and they did not disappoint     This should be a Austin icon  
Juan In A Million,29,Great breakfast tacos    Came here at 11am on tuesday and there was no wait. There are complimentary chips and salsa. I got don juan el grande tacos and they were SO good. Theres So much filling in the taco so they recommend getting 2 extra flour tortillas.
Juan In A Million,30,My friend and I had a big day ahead and decided to start our breakfast out right with some good food from Juan in a Million. We ordered their popular Don Juan El Taco Grande...which was indeed grande.  Filled with eggs  potatoes  bacon  and cheese  it was the perfect breakfast taco. I got a side of sour cream as well.   Lots of seating and their Horchata tasted great 
Juan In A Million,31,First time visitor here- I came here straight from the airport with a friend after seeing the high number of reviews for this place.  We waited around 20 minutes for a table of two  which wasn t bad. We were sat a table with complimentary chips and salsa already on the table. Much appreciated this  as we were starving by the time we landed. If you love spice  this salsa is right up your alley   I ordered the beef enchiladas for myself and had no regrets. The sauce and cheese on the enchiladas paired perfectly with everything. My dish also came with a side of corn tortillas which was nice to eat with the refried beans and rice. Would highly recommend 
Juan In A Million,32,Ok  so the name doesn t instill thoughts of  authentic Mexican   then getting there from I35 to restaurant was through a pretty rough area. It was one of two places I mapped on Yelp  I thought maybe I should have tried the other.  There was a line of people waiting to be seated  we got on the list and was asked for inside or outside seating  it was a nice warm morning so we did outside and no wait. Outside isn t really outside  it s a covered enclosed patio with fans and very comfortable. The service was very good  the breakfast was even better. I got a classic egg with papas and beans with good homemade tortillas. The salsa was tasty and a nice little bit of spice. My wife got the breakfast tacos  she ordered two and it was plenty. The tacos were full size  filled with meat  beans  potatoes and again the salsa was very good.  Overall  it s a place we would go back to for a good authentic meal.  Parking  they had plenty in back and there is some street parking. The place was busy so be prepared for a possible wait.
Juan In A Million,33,Absolutely amazing service and even better food.  I ordered 70 breakfast tacos for our firm this morning and like most large orders I place I have to worry about hiccups of some kind. Not today  everything went smoothly  the tacos were hot when they arrived and each labeled correctly  most importantly delicious and on time. We will be ordering our breakfast tacos from here from now on. The only small complaint I have is that I had to place two separate orders on grub hub because they have a limit on how much you can order on one placed order. But in the end I received everything I needed to put smiles on the faces of my peers. Thanks Juan in a Million 
Juan In A Million,34,Went to Juan in a million after wanting to go to this place the last time I was in Austin. I ended up getting the don taco grande and it was absolutely delicious. This is literally such a huge taco and is filled with eggs cheese potatoes and bacon. Ever bite is absolutely divine and I couldn t stop eating. This taco was big though so was able to take like half to go since there was so much food. Loved this and would totally go back 
Juan In A Million,35,Literally the best breakfast tacos anywhere. FOR OVER 20 YEARS     This is my go to spot every time I come back to Austin. Discovered it while in college. Love this place. AND Mr. Juan still shakes hands  
Juan In A Million,36,I did not want to wait an hour in line for a table  so I ordered my tacos to-go. I feel like I saved so much time and avoided the extra frills involved in getting a table. I placed my order  was able to pay with Apple Pay  and got my food in less than 15 minutes  They were so crowded on a Sunday morning - both indoor and outdoor tables were full. They have a parking lot in the back.  I d be lying if I said I didn t just come here because I love the pun in their name.  I ve also heard so much about the Don Juan taco  and it definitely lived up to its hype. At  6.75  it is massive. The cheese doesn t even fit inside the tortilla. I m pretty sure I took a couple of bites and didn t even look like I did any damage. I really enjoyed the migas taco  3.95 with cheese. Their salsa is great. I m not sure if I d come back for the Don Juan  but the migas was for sure something I d come back for.
Juan In A Million,37,Second time at the place. It s been years. I ordered  Don Juan Taco Grande  make sure you get extra tortillas.   My Friend ordered Migas Taco with cheese and a Beef Fajita Taco. My friends ordered the enchilada plate and a carne asada taco.   All these items were too notch  Still is the best in Austin hands down  Authentic taste  amp  excellent value for your money    A perfect spot for breakfast tacos in east Austin and more. Nice outdoor patio and comfy indoors. I definitely recommend this restaurant  I need to come more often 
Juan In A Million,38,Open since 1980  Juan in A Million is a bit of a hole in the wall. I had seen Juan in A Million on the TV show  Man Vs. Food  but wasn t really expecting much. The dining area is much larger than I was expecting. They have multiple rooms with multiple tables  including a covered patio.  There was no wait for breakfast on a Monday morning. We were seated  given some chips and salsa  and the menu. Chips and salsa tasted fresh and homemade. Good low level spice on the salsa too. Still wasn t expecting much looking at the menu. We placed our orders and the food arrived soon after  less than 10 minutes. Excellent service.   Figured I would order the Don Juan El Taco Grande since I had seen it on TV. Per the menu  it s a secret combination of potato  egg  bacon and cheese in a deliciously hot tortilla. It s also ginormous. The waitress offered me extra tortillas  and one Don Juan was enough to make four huge tacos. It s also surprisingly delicious despite the common ingredients. Makes me wonder how I can make it for myself at home.   I also tried a barbacoa taco because I wanted to try something more Mexican. Best barbacoa I have ever had. It was fall apart tender  extremely juicy  rich  and flavorful.   If I had a choice between barbacoa from Juan in a Million and some brisket from Franklin BBQ  I would choose the barbacoa  based on flavor alone.  It s also ludicrously cheap. A huge breakfast for two was about  15.   5 stars.  1200th Review 
Juan In A Million,39,You will leave feeling FULL and Satisfied    Order the Juan in a Million grande for the ultimate breakfast taco experience in AUSTIN   
Juan In A Million,40,Water coming out of the sink is 50000 degrees and burnt my hand to a crisp  idk how that s even legal.
Juan In A Million,41,Juan in A million is one of Austin s top staples and for good reason. The food is great and definitely home styled cooking. The owner himself is usually there and is very friendly. The day we went they were extremely busy  which they usually are   and yet the service was great. They really appreciate their customers. I would recommend not going on to empty of a stomach because the wait is usually 30-60 mins.
Juan In A Million,42,The reviews are accurate. I was looking for something that would be open early on a Saturday morning and close to downtown. This popped up and the website looked good so I figured why not. There was a bit of a wait which told me the secret about this place was out already but we only has to wait 20 minutes. The food came out quick and was hardy. I couldn t even finish all my food but I kept trying cause it was so good.
Juan In A Million,43,AMAZING FOOD   I love the tacos and the staff is super friendly. Will be back soon   
Juan In A Million,44,I have been going here for 20 plus years since I worked downtown as a courier.  I used to go there every Friday back then.   They are one of the only places that makes their salsa close to how hot my mother-in-law used to make. Their food is great as well as their service.  We drive from Georgetown now to go eat there on the weekends because the food is so good.  I only wish there was one closer to us now. We drove there during the Covid-19 pandemic and would get food to eat in our truck because there food is that good  amp  worth the drive   
Juan In A Million,45,It was a cold morning in Austin. And I still went there for a breakfast taco to go  The barbacoa was bout good as hell. The other tacos were good too. What I like most is that the tacos aren t skimpy. They actually put enough food in there were 2 of them will sit right with you. Depends on how big you are as a human too lol They do have indoor seating as well. I might have to go in there and sit down one day. If you visit Austin you need to try. It is a staple for Austin 
Juan In A Million,46,This OG Austin eatery gives me a lot of nostalgia. I used to come here in college and several years later  this place is still as busy as ever. The owner and all the employees are exceptionally nice. My favorite item on the menu is the Don Juan. You practically get five whole tacos out of this monstrous plate of bacon  cheese  egg  and potatoes. Their tortillas are very well made. For  6.75  it s a steal  I had to talk my partner out of ordering one for himself because there was no way he would finish it. We were full sharing one. If any of my friends are in town visiting  Juan in a Million would definitely be a place where I d bring them.
Juan In A Million,47,Would not even allow us in because we have a service dog. Rude  And unbelievable in this day and age.
Juan In A Million,48,I have been wanting to come here forever  but just kept putting it off. I am so glad we finally came for brunch and enjoyed an Austin gem  which such great service  food  and personality  I was immediately making a mental list of who I wanted to bring here next and came super close to buying a shirt on my way out. I was SOLD. BEST REFRIED BEANS IVE HAD IN THE CITY. MAYBE ANY CITY. The food is just your Mexican good delicious food  but those beans.... They take the cake. I might even put them on cake.
Juan In A Million,49,Definitely a five star breakfast spot. Friendly and quick service and delicious fresh food  Don Juan el taco grande is a must order  We ordered two extra tortillas with it. Huevos a la Mexicana is also amazing  Portions are huge  I will say the guacamole was very bland and overpriced  but the other prices were fair. We will definitely be returning for breakfast while in Austin 
Juan In A Million,50,A real Austin gem   The location was easy to find  and there was a parking lot in the back. We were immediately warmly greeted by the owner who was both friendly and charismatic. It genuinely felt as if I had entered a friend s home.   The free salsa was too spicy for the tortilla chips but perfect to put on the Don Juan El Taco Grande  The Don Juan El Taco Grande without bacon was mediocre and had too much cheese. It came with two additional tortillas and had a large portion of filling.   However  the horchata was sweet  milky  and delightfully light  The cup was also the ideal size to share with a significant other. My boyfriend ordered the Huevos a La Mexicana and remarked that it reminded him of his grandmother s recipe    There were beautifully painted murals and vivid colorful walls throughout the restaurant. The plants and flowers were alive and thriving. You could easily tell that a lot of love and hard work had been put into the restaurant.  Additionally  there was plenty of shade to sit outside on a hot summer day. The only main feedback I have is that it would be nice if there was free wifi there.
Juan In A Million,51,Great food and excellent service. I had the Don Juan El Taco Grande and it was a huge portion for  6.50. Plus it is amazing   Lots of flavor. Their salsa is delicious too 
Juan In A Million,52,Kinda overrated. Came because of man vs food and we were in the area. The salsa was good and the tacos had good flavor. Meat was soft but not a fan of the texture of it. Was expecting more from it but eh
Juan In A Million,53,Great and cheap place for Mexican food. They give big portions and the staff are very friendly and attentive. The food was good  my favorite breakfast taco that I got was chorizo and bacon.
Juan In A Million,54,W came here early Saturday morning because everyone said we have to try it  And obviously we have to come to Juan in a million  The service was good no complaints and they were very prompt with the order and we received our food pretty fast. We ordered two Don Juan it was pretty good. My bf loved it I thought it was a bit dry but not bad. The serving is quite big  My bf just finished his and I got like 1 3 in haha. The horchata was amazing so fresh I drank 2 maybe that s why I couldn t finish my giant taco lol.  Anyway not bad at all maybe I should ve tried something else but would definitely come back to try something else 
Juan In A Million,55,Great bang for your buck for breakfast tacos. A generous portion of egg  potato   bacon and cheese served with 3 tortillas will leave you full and ready to conquer your day. Plus they offer chips and salsa so it s a win-win. The service is quick and friendly so you can t go wrong with breakfast from Juan in a Million  
Juan In A Million,56,At first I was going to go by this place is because I am from Mexico so it s hard to find good tacos. But it is one of austins staples and certainly worth a try. I will say that the Menudo and Barbacoa is so good here. They are totally worth going to and getting every now and then it is a great place. And a fun atmosphere.
Juan In A Million,57,First time here we went on a Sunday morning for breakfast. There was no wait so we were seated right away. Service was super quick and friendly. There are so many option on the menu so we went with a platter and two tacos. Everything was AMAZING. I can t wait to come back and try lunch 
Juan In A Million,58,It was a very underwhelming experience. I love all kinds of cuisines  but this was at best a mediocre lunch a buddy of mine and I had. Not terrible but not good either.
Juan In A Million,59,I can t believe it took me four years to finally come to Juan in a Million  but I definitely saved one of Austin s treasures for last. This place doesn t have any frills and doesn t seem like much on first glance  but everything is incredible. Service is great  which surprised me because I didn t think anyone would come to our table more than once. However  our food  drinks  chip refills  and check came promptly. Servers are really nice and helpful. Get their most popular item because it s a lot of food and great value too. Their horchata is one of the best in Austin and it s also a huge cup too. Their salsa and chips are great  and my friends who are big fans of salsa love this place.   I highly recommend  Anytime I crave breakfast tacos I will be coming here.
Juan In A Million,60,Juan s  Does not disappoint with the spicy spicy salsa and ever crispy chips. I can t think of anything I ve eaten here that I didn t like  although I do stick to non meat items. The cheese enchiladas are simply fantastic  old style Tex-Mex and yummy. The migas with cheese rock.
Juan In A Million,61,This is a local hidden gem. Not from Austin but I m glad we found this place. Definitely a local s secret. Restaurant was busy but service was on top of everything. Daily lunch specials were priced well  portions were perfect and everything was delicious. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be pleased with the food and service.
Juan In A Million,62,I never thought I liked breakfast tacos until I had these. The bacon egg and cheese taco is LIFE CHANGING. So  so  so  so good. Bacon is large and crisp  egg fluffy  tortilla so soft. The potato and egg is also phenomenal.
Juan In A Million,63,Cute little taco spot in Austin.  There s no seating in the restaurant at the moment but they do have an outdoor patio.  Our waitress was very patient and friendly.  We enjoyed our food  which tasted home cooked.  I would definitely come back here.
Juan In A Million,64,We came here based on a recommendation from a friend. It s a pretty nice hole-in-the-wall spot and was pretty packed on a Saturday morning. The food was definitely a lot better than what I was expecting. We ordered the con queso breakfasts and the Don Juan el taco grande. The portions were huge  especially the Don Juan special which was stacked for only  6.75. Definitely recommended 
Juan In A Million,65,Okay  so we were visiting Austin from San Antonio for a conference and I was told this was a must try    The sweet tea was really good  the wait wasn t that bad for having a long line  about 30 mins . I appreciate the staff - my hardworking gente getting things done but the food wasn t standout for me. I got the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo sauce. Ehhhh.   Also  I don t think the tortillas were real guys. They tasted smelt like they had a shelf life of 2 years. I m from San Antonio where the tortillas are fresh  fluffy  soft and omg.  but once I got them served to me  in a little piece of foil  because they were that small  it was endgame for me.   Just take my review with a grain of salt because I do feel like if you ve never been it s good to try and you be the judge if it s worth the hype or not. For me  it s a  definitely not.  Meh.    update - despite what the owner s comment says  no they were not homemade tortillas.
Juan In A Million,66,A family restaurant. The food was excellent. My husband had the huevos machacados and I had the Con queso breakfast. Everything is homemade  best white corn tortillas. We will be back  for sure.
Juan In A Million,67,Inexpensive place to grab brunch and I must say it was quite delicious. The only thing I wish was that they give you a little bit more meat but the eggs were cooked perfectly. The tortillas are fresh and seem homemade while the service is quick and efficient. come try out this location institution for yourselves 
Juan In A Million,68,Dang this place is so value it s crazy. I could have easily got 2 meals out of this. The Don Juan provides sooo much food I was so in shock. Definitely the place to go in Austin  I would recommend getting at least 2 tortillas extra though  only 20 cents each 
Juan In A Million,69,I know this is a popular place based on its history and TV appearances. The restaurant has a nice ambiance  menu is well-priced  and the staff is friendly. However  growing up in the RGV and knowing Tex Mex  I can tell you the food is not good. The tortillas are store bought and flavorless. The chips look like they are Doritos bought at the grocery store. My carne guisada plate had more lettuce and beans than beef. Nice place but below average food.
Juan In A Million,70,Still a solid Austin breakfast   Friendly service.   The recommended Don Juan El Taco Grande was perfect and huge. Ask for a few extra tortillas and you have 3 tacos easy.   Chips and salsa - the salsa had great flavor and is hot which is not always easily achieved.  Horchata was also huge  delicious and refreshing.  Husband had a barbacoa and a miga taco with no complaints. He admitted to liking them both    He s not a huge breakfast taco fan...don t get me started lol 
Juan In A Million,71,One of the few things that hasn t change about Austin is how good the Don Juan breakfast taco is. I would eat here everyday if I could. Praise the Lord and pass the tacos 
Juan In A Million,72,I am from LA on my first visit to Austin  TX and based upon the recommendation of one of my very close friends who is originally from Austin  my friend and I decided to visit JIAM. The service was great  the food was great  the grande breakfast taco outstanding--but for a popular breakfast restaurant I have to mention that the coffee was just terrible  like dishwater. Granted the restaurant ended up not charging us for it  but it still it took away from the otherwise wonderful experience  because this day and age  I think most customers in a major city expect decent coffee. I am writing this review with the hope that the management of the restaurant reset and upgrades is coffee
Juan In A Million,73, Old Austin Establishments  need to keep their game strong if they re going to stay in business. Juan in a Million didn t give me my money s worth and didn t offer to make things right.   I came in with one thing on my mind  queso and eggs. Things started off wrong when I asked for water with no ice and the server came back with a glass of ice water. It s not like she had other distractions between when I ordered it and when she brought it out. It was immediate. She just didn t listen. It was past their lunch rush. But that s just water. Not a deal breaker. Their Con Queso Breakfast seemed like what I was craving  but not all of it. I wasn t feeling the meat and potatoes that came with it. I asked the server if I could sub these things for extra eggs and queso. She said I could. However  when the meal came out it sure looked like the normal size serving of eggs and queso. When she brought me my ticket to pay  it just said no cg  carne guisada  or potatoes  no note to the kitchen about extra anything else. When I brought this up  I was told they don t do substitutions. That would have been fine  if they told me that in the beginning. I would have ordered the full meal as is. Instead they just gave me an empty apology and I left with only half the food I paid for. Communication  folks  You failed.   Also  the food was meh. The queso was more like a combination of something between queso and ranchero sauce. The tortillas were dry.   Not coming back in a million years.
Juan In A Million,74,I enjoyed the vibe of the place. The staff was attentive and sweet and the service overall was great. It was super packed on Saturday  so be prepared to wait  I don t remember if they do reservations . The chips were good and the salsa was pretty good  so enjoy  Do yourself and get the horchata. It s unbelievable and  even with ice  there s a lot that s served  so it might even be good for two to sip.  The Caldo de Res was an extremely pleasant sopa and it made me think that if my grandma was an abuelita  she might be able to make something so hearty and loving  I felt loved consuming it . The tortillas are also good and yummy even on their own. Now  the Don Juan is giant and unsurprisingly filling with a great combo of filling. My only knock is that it s oily and feels very fatty  understandable  there s a decent amount of cheese in there . If you understand that going in  it s fun   I d come back here and try their other breakfast tacos. Judging from the quality of the food  I would definitely recommend this as a spot to get breakfast 
Juan In A Million,75,Home cooking. Good prices. We came late and the Don Juan was not as fresh as it was in the past.
Juan In A Million,76,The breakfast taco portion was very filling. Overall great bang for your buck. I personally love my burritos with a lot of sauce and when the food came I asked for some ketchup and hot sauce. A long time passed and she walked by our table like she had forgot and then I went to ask another waitress. In short  by the time I got the sauces the eggs were cold. Very disappointed
Juan In A Million,77,Barbacoa tacos best I ve ever had. Staff was super friendly. The area of town is kind of rough and sketchy.
Juan In A Million,78,This place is now added to my Austin favorites list. It was Saturday around 1 20. There was no line  we got a table right away.   They took our drink order and delivered chips and salsa pretty quickly. I had a water and horchata  highly recommend the horchata- comes in a huge cup and it taste good   The chips were crispy and the salsa was so good  I could eat it everyday.  We ordered queso breakfast and the Don Juan taco with a barbacoa taco  the barbacoa taco needs to get the awesome salsa over it  So good  so good     I can t wait to go back.
Juan In A Million,79,Drove into Austin on a MONDAY to find this gem was open. Typically on Mondays  you will not find your family owned mexican food establishments open in Austin  ie...amayas  enchiladas y mas etc  My MIL was in town from Kansas so this was a treat and a all around score  She got the enchilada plate  one cheese  one beef . I got the taco plate thinking the waitress had agreed with me that they make their own taco shells  or fry their own. which they do not. I ended up using my MIL corn tortillas and dumped my second taco into it and then made a taco salad out of the remainder of my plate. The salsa was perfect and spicy.  Downfall  their hours are now 7am-2pm everyday  but my question is why is there a dinner section on the menu when lunch is as far as you can possibly order  I had called in advance prior to driving from Georgetown bc all listings say they are still open until 3pm.  Cesar Chavez is turning into a nasty area and really deters anyone from wanting to go venture on the east side of austin when this is the authentic food and appeal mostly everyone is drawn to except for the blocks upon blocks of tents and hounding of panhandlers.  Honestly I wish I could make it down to the restaurant to try breakfast bc I ve heard it s great and I failed to read on the virtual menu if it s served all day. perhaps another day  most of all it was great food. thanks from my tastebuds 
Juan In A Million,80,Recommendation  Not necessarily worth the wait or hype  but still good and large portions.  I had higher expectations because of the line outside and the previous reviews. I got the Don Juan which seemed like their most popular item and it was just a solid breakfast taco. Salsa was good  potatoes and tortilla were fluffy  eggs were light  bacon was a little soggy  cheese wasn t melted  altogether decent but nothing amazing. I will say it is dense and heavy and very filling.  Ordered  Don Juan El Taco Grande  Price    7
Juan In A Million,81,We were told this place would meet our expectations for a good breakfast but warned that it s popular and might be busy  I said I m down  Green flags for me    The wait was only 10 min but were called back within 5 min. Food was quickly brought out and sooo good. I got the steak breakfast . Meat was tender and the beans were my favorite. They tasted fresh and were so flavorful.
Juan In A Million,82,Welll 2 stars or 3    It s been around a while and is quite the locals  find. That being said  in a town with more taco spots than Manhattan has Starbucks  it has some tough competition to fend off.   The positive  The taco was huge  with a lot of stuffing.  The negative  The flavors were just not there - migas was bland  meats were way too salty  and the salsa tasted ketchupy.   I had expected more from this self-proclaimed  authentic  place.
Juan In A Million,83,My friends and I stopped here for brunch on a suggestion from our Lyft driver. It did not disappoint  This local staple has been making delicious Mexican food since the 1980s    I had a great mimosa for  2.50 and the Don Juan El taco grande. This is huge  Definitely enough to share with at least one person. It s a yummy scramble of potato  egg  bacon and cheese with a side of fresh tortillas  They also have free chips and salsa -- even for breakfast. I would recommend getting here early because they always have a wait. I would definitely like to check this out in a return trip to Austin.
Juan In A Million,84,One of my very favorite places to get breakfast  The Taco Grande is my go-to and the salsa has the perfect amount of heat  I ve introduced this place to many friends and they all agree that it is worth the wait. It s very busy but I ve yet to wait more than 25mins.
Juan In A Million,85,If you re a first timer here and don t know what to get.. get the Don Juan el Taco Grande  There s a big box drawn around it for a reason    I thought there was no way that ONE taco could fill me up... but boy was I wrong. This taco is HUGE  and they really fill it up with eggs  bacon  potato and cheese  The ingredients might sound simple  but it s so savory and delicious  Suggestion  Ask for an extra flour tortilla  or 2 . There s THAT much filling that you can make multiple smaller tacos with the extra tortilla. The prices here are just right too. This gigantic breakfast taco is  6.50  If I m ever back in the area  I already know I ll be stopping by again 
Juan In A Million,86,An Austin classic that s definitely worth a visit  From the shaded patio seating and the vibrantly colored floors  to the hole in the wall vibes and neighborhood location  this place screams Austin.  The Don Juan is a massive  6 plate of breakfast taco goodness that s hard to not enjoy. It has all the essential ingredients  bacon  eggs  cheese  and potatoes  and combines them in a massive serving. It s a hearty meal alone  but we especially enjoyed the tortillas that came with. They re soft with the perfect amount of chew  which fit perfectly with the fluffy eggs. Our group of 3 even struggled to finish it  Whether as a nice brunch or hangover cure  it s a definitely worth a visit 
Juan In A Million,87,Juan In A Million is a must-go-to spot in Austin  Believe the Hype. The wait seems to be longer on Sundays but it s not too bad and definitely worth it. All the employees are very sweet and welcoming. You get different areas you can sit at like inside  or the outside covered patio.  I ordered the most popular dish  Don Juan El Taco Grande and it was so delicious  To drink I ordered a mimosa and it didn t disappoint at all 
Juan In A Million,88,Wow  this place had an unbelievable amount of reviews. It was time we checked it out. We brought some friends who were in from out of town and hankering for Tex Mex. I would definitely give it a solid four stars. Very tasty traditional Tex Mex  Large servings and lots to choose from. When our Minnesota friends ask for Mexican food I am sure this is what they are interested in.
Juan In A Million,89,Visiting from San Antonio  I have never seen anything like this place. When you have over 100 people eating at one location and about 50 of them are waiting in line to just get in or place an order you know what to expect.  I personally met Juan and I can not say enough about him  He is the true definition of  if you want something done right do it yourself  mentality. The way he handles every customer as a usual and a friend makes me feel so welcomed that I didn t want to leave. The way he transitions from greeting customers  to taking orders  to the registers is completely unmatched by any means. Most people complain about having to do someone else s job  this guy thrives and Excels from this. Now for the food part  we ll if you haven t seen the 5 stars  then let me tell you   The best breakfast spot you can find as an outsider coming in. You will be full and not know what to do with the left overs. Absolutely great place  great energy  and unmatched customer service. If you can find somewhere else that matches or even competes to this In Austin   let me know   I really wish my phone hadn t lost all my pictures  I could of had plenty of photos for you guys  but please take my word for it    
Juan In A Million,90,Cute little joint  super friendly staff. Walked about 1.3 m  from my hotel. They must be short staffed  the first dining room was closed so there was a wait. I opted for a to go order instead. Beef flautas  no rice  guacamole  amp  sour cream on the side. Packaged well for my walk back  but 2 very tiny flautas for  12.50. Will try something else next time 
Juan In A Million,91,The Tex Mex diner of your dreams. Seriously I was dream of their carne guisada breakfast.
Juan In A Million,92,The food and the service were awesome. The staff was very pleasant and attentive  pricing was very moderate as well.
Juan In A Million,93,Same great food  same fast friendly service since the first time I walked thru the doors in 1983. Now I can t come to Austin without making a trip to Don Juan s for breakfast tacos  and an enchilada plate.   And as always I took extras to go   Mmmmmwah  So delicious.   Juan in a Million family  I m so grateful you made it thru the pandemic and are still serving Austin with the same greatness since I first walked in 39 years ago   Juan I understand you still greet people with the same spirit if hospitality. Maybe I ll see you in person next time I roll thru 
Juan In A Million,94,Just two words folks  Don Juan. Yeah you know what I m talkin  about. The Don Juan  Do you understand now   Okay maybe you don t so I ll explain. That s the name of dish you must get when you re here for breakfast. Their menu even has it enclosed in a box by itself and labeled recommended. If that doesn t get you to order it then I don t know what will. After having it  they re obviously right.  So now that you re curious  what is it  The full name is Don Juan El Taco Grande. The menu states it s a secret combination of bacon  eggs  potatoes  and cheese on a hot flour tortilla. Take a look at my picture and notice the portion size. It s freakin  ginormous  As you can see  the one single tortilla it comes with by default doesn t even come close to being enough to close it up. Therefore  you need two extra tortillas and the servers will recommend this when you order. And thus  you re able to create 3 tacos with this single dish. And the great thing about all of this  It cost only  6.50 for all this food. If that s not a good deal then I don t know what is. You leave super full and satisfied. And it tastes just as good as it sounds. Any time you have bacon  eggs  potatoes  and cheese all mixed together you just know it s gonna be fabulous. Oh yeah  they also included free chips and salsa to start off with while you wait for your food. The salsa was spicccccccccyyy  Wooooo  But it was oh so good  I put some of that salsa on my Don Juan and that s just next level  baby   Overall  come on over and get you some Don Juan for breakfast people  At the price point  it s a steal and you won t be disappointed 
Juan In A Million,95,So we came here because of the amount of reviews it had and here s what I thought...Well with all the reviews I expected much more. Now I m not saying this place wasn t good it just wasn t what I expected maybe overhyped  If you want a burrito don t come here. What Mexican restaurant doesn t have burritos  Oh this Juan. I had Don Juan el taco grande  special which was good and filling. The amount of food you get for  7 bucks is ALOT. Get the queso with your chips and salsa  salsa is hot btw . The taco salad is literally a shell  meat lettuce some cheese and a package of ranch. Not the best IMO. You have to dress it up yourself. The price here is great and the quality of the food is excellent but nothing that makes this place stand out which is why I gave it 4 stars.   Would come back if I m looking for a cheap quick bite   JK pro tip  get extra sides and stuff to use on your food. Taco servings are massive so you can easily share.
Juan In A Million,96,Located close to downtown Austin  the restaurant looks like a two houses that were joined together. Looks like a small hole in the wall but the menu looked like some authentic Tex Mex. we came in during breakfast hours  and I got the Juan Grande Burrito for about  8. Definitely a really good deal. It s huge and basically like a breakfast burrito. It had some pretty good spices to it as well. I wouldn t say it s the best breakfast burrito I ve ever had but for the value and portion size - I definitely feel like it s worth it. The wait staff were incredibly friendly and chips and salsa that came with the meal were tasty. Nothing to write home to mama about but none the less worth checking out if you are looking for some good Tex Mex.
Juan In A Million,97,10 30am Sunday  BUSY  HOUR LONG WAIT  Parking is shared with the block. There are a couple of spots directly in front of the restaurant if you re lucky  Atmosphere- mom  amp  pop hole in the wall vibe Service- confusing yet helpful Price-     Experience  Austin is so progressive when it comes to technology in my opinion. This restaurant uses pen and paper for their waiting list. Then  they have a worker tell out your name. This isn t a big deal if you re close by. I mention because most of the restaurants I visited in Austin have digital waiting lists or buzzers. They do have contactless payment  NFC  Apple Pay  Google Pay  etc...   The reason I said service was confusing yet helpful is because you are sat by one person  and then another person will ask you for your drink orders. Followed by a completely different person who will come and ask you for your food order. Once that food is ready another server will bring it to your table. Then periodically through your meal different servers will check on you. I enjoyed the attention but I wasn t sure who to ask for refills. I m used to a certain way  but the way they do it here is different. It s not bad  just different. I think that s the reason we weren t attended to after being sat for about 5-7 minutes.  My food was good. I m not a food connoisseur. So do With that information as you will.  It s rated well  food is good in my opinion  but nothing stood out. If you re in the area  stop by.   I m used to music  dancing  singing  excitement. That s not the vibe here. It s a safe pick for brunch
Juan In A Million,98,One word  Overrated      a lot of hype for average Tasting Mexican Food . The Breakfast tacos were bland tasting . I did enjoy the authentic old area and building of the location.
Juan In A Million,99,I travelled to Austin to visit family last month and knew I had to come to Juan In A Million. I ve heard so many good things and let me tell you - the hype is real.   My family and I each ordered the Don Juan El Taco Grande per many suggestions from family and Yelp reviewers. This is a MUST order as it s easily one of the best meals I ve ever had. I could travel to Austin right now and go back just thinking about it    The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming. Juan In A Million is a must if you re in town 
Juan In A Million,100,The Don Juan breakfast taco is huge and tastes amazing. You can tell this is a true mom and pop type of restaurant. Everything is very homemade and the restaurant itself is comfortable. Can t recommend Juan in a million enough.
Juan In A Million,101,1st of all THE NAME is too cute not to come see what this is about  Omgeeeeeee this place did not disappoint  I love the family feel when you enter and is welcomed by Mr Juan himself   The line was pretty long and had people waiting outside. Unfortunately we waited outside for about 20 minutes thinking it was the line To put our names down. So don t wait outside unless you already put your name on the list. When your table is available they will call  your name.   We sat outside ate chips and Salsa .... boy oh boy their salsa was delicious but super spicy  Grab-your water quick  haha  their queso with ground meat was delicious not too thick and not too watery. We had the Don Juan Taco El Grande with extra corn tortilla  they gave 2 extra tortillas   amp  added refried beans. So it comes with a flour tortilla caked with Eggs  chorizo   smoked  bacon  amp  shredded cheese . I literally made 4 corn tortilla-tacos with enough left over for a 5th... I will come back for Juan in a Million again.
Juan In A Million,102,I ve heard many things about the famous Don Juan El Grande Taco but unfortunately  it did not live up to the hype. Don t get me wrong - it s a ton of food and definitely a great deal but I didn t think it was anything special. If you re looking for an affordable meal  this taco is for you. However  if you re looking for great tasting tacos... maybe not the spot.   Still  the service was great and they had complimentary chips   salsa for dine-in customers.
Juan In A Million,103,I have been coming to Juan In A Million for years.  It s my go to breakfast spot after a crazy night on Dirty Sixth.  It was featured on the Travel Channel many years ago and it still is a popular spot.  Parking isn t the greatest and you can expect a long wait on the weekends.  The staff is friendly and the owner is always around greeting his customers.    The restaurant itself is super tiny and most likely you are going to be seated in the back area which consists of a big patio.  With the pandemic  the inside is closed for dine in.  They will seat you outside which is not ideal in the summer.  Each table seems to be right under big industrial fans which makes for a very unpleasant dining experience.  Chips  napkins and little kids were flying everywhere   I also do not like getting canned drinks because they too fly around and also you are charged for each one.    Their Don Juan El Taco Grande is one of their main draws. It s  one  taco  but it can be made into atleast 4 or 5 filling tacos.  It is filled with eggs  potatoes  bacon and cheese. Their cheese is super salty  so keep that in mind. All together this meal is filling and tasty and you will not leave hungry. It s not the fanciest food but it gets the job done.   Overall this place is ok in my book. I feel like it s lost it s magic to me as I get older. I m sure I ll be back eventually  but I gotta check out the rest of Austin s awesome food scene first.
Juan In A Million,104,Came here on the recommendation of a friend. This place is a dive  but the food is excellent. The burritos are massive - one probably is the equivalent of 3 regular sized burritos because they stuff them so full  amp  give you extra tortillas. I wish we had known before hand  because we ended up wasting food.  The place was full  but they were fast  amp  efficient.  We sat on the patio  amp  it was cold outside  but they had heaters that worked nicely.  Didn t get to see Juan  but that s ok.  All in all def a good meal  amp  would go back when we re in Austin again.
Juan In A Million,105,This was my first time at Juan in a Million and I really liked it. The chicken enchilada are so good. The verdes sauce is some of the best I ve had. We also had the guacamole  which was really good. Service was great.   The only reason I m giving 4 stars is because of having to wait outside. It was really uncomfortable waiting for about 30 minutes outside in the heat. I recognize that there s not much Juan can do about that  but I probably won t be back until the weather is cooler. Most of the seating is on the patio  but we requested inside  where there are only  5 available tables due to Covid. It s purely my preference  but I prefer a restaurant where I don t have to wait outside.
Juan In A Million,106,Overall great experience  delicious food and very affordable  You will not leave here hungry. Fresh chips and salsa were delivered to our table as soon as we sat down. We were craving breakfast tacos and we got the best  Inside seating was limited due to Covid but the outdoor patio is covered and perfectly nice.  The Don Juan Taco Grande is no joke  You will definitely need the extra taco shells and I recommend putting a little of their homemade hot sauce on it.
Juan In A Million,107,Such a charming patio for breakfast. We ordered the specialty breakfast taco which was a combo of bacon  eggs  potatoes. It was very yummy and enough to make 3 tacos  The flour tortillas are fresh and delish. The wonderful waitstaff kept our coffee cups filled 
Juan In A Million,108,What is up with all of the negativity towards the tortillas  I ve heard nothing but good things about this place but it seems like lately there has been a lot of issues with the tortillas   Like the owner said though  talk to the server  don t get into a mood and post about it online..  Probably why your marriage didn t work out  lol jk but it helps big time when you use your words
Juan In A Million,109,No matter the time of day  you get chips and salsa. I m not going to argue with that.   They have a lot of different rooms  and I was taken into one that only had 2 other people in it  while others were half full...seemed odd and made me feel like they wanted my solo dining self in and out  I had the potato taco and a bean taco. Both were good  but plain.   If you plan to pay by card  be prepared to do quick math when you pay as you will have to tell them the amount you want to tip.
Juan In A Million,110,Oh lordy it took me three years to get my ass to Juan in a Million and I finally do it in the middle of a pandemic.  What pandemic  Juan in a Million s business seems to be getting along quite fine  at least on the weekend. I m not quite ready for dine-in so I ordered take out and it took 30 mins to get my food  so order ahead if you can    So for my first visit  there will be more    I obviously needed to get the Don Juan giant taco. Drove it home so it was sitting in the bag for 15 mins but dannnng it was still so good      The potatoes are mushy and almost creamy  in a good way  and mixed together with the bacon and egg. If you like all your ingredients separate  this isn t for you. I can appreciate individual pieces but I also LOVE the mashy-mixy where you get everything in each bite.  And then the melty American cheese brings it all together. I can appreciate American cheese with the right uses  and this is the right uses. Non-traditional  Yes. But heckin tasty  Hell yes.   And you know what else is non-traditional  The need to eat this taco with a fork. Some reviewers call for asking for an extra flour tortilla. I m kind of glad I didn t because I m now lying on my couch too full my move as it is  even without eating an extra tortilla.
Juan In A Million,111,Juans for the win  Delish breakfast again. Good service and didn t have to wait to long. Long standing established restaurant here in Austin  A must visit. Kids and friends will love it 
Juan In A Million,112,This place was amazing. The best barbacoa and menudo I ve ever had. My husband had the queso eggs and loved them. The portion sizes are huge. The prices are very decent. The staff was super nice and accommodating. We re obsessed. Would come back again when we re in Austin for sure.
Juan In A Million,113,Even though it was a bit hot outside  the fans but he outside area kept it really cool. I had the steak which was really good. The flautas are also recommended  Staff is very attentive and honestly- I didn t expect the owner to great us- it was great. Made us feel at home 
Juan In A Million,114,The. Most. Amazing. Breakfast Tacos. Ever. A friend at work bought us some tacos one morning and they were the best breakfast tacos that I have ever tasted. Really delicious. Pro tip  cheese is extra and you should add it 
Juan In A Million,115,Delicious  quick and plentiful breakfast.  The Don Juan taco is huge and incredibly filling.  The con queso breakfast had great flavor and was served with a side of tortillas so you can build your own breakfast tacos.  The staff were very friendly and prompt.   If we are ever back in Austin we will definitely be back.
Juan In A Million,116,Be ready for a wait.  The food was traditional no frills breakfast options.  Service was decent  but everyone was quite busy.
Juan In A Million,117,The only reason I didn t give 5 stars was when we were sent to find our own table the only ones they had were in a questionable area  We gave it a chance our waitress was very nice and the breakfast burrito was amazing Don juan el taco grande it s only 6.50 it s huge if they offer you another tortilla take it you will need it  The only thing that made us really lose our appetite was the man brought us orange juice he wasn t carrying it on a tray  He reached in his pocket and pulled it out it just felt dirty  But overall the staff and the food were amazing
Juan In A Million,118,We were in town for a visit and wanted something different than the chain restaurants.  This place was amazing   Great service  wonderful food   amp  reasonable prices.  I got the queso breakfast and loved it. I feel like you can tell alot about a Mexican restaurant by their chips and hot sauce... theirs did not disappoint   We will definitely be back 
Juan In A Million,119,This review is really hard for me because I used to eat here all of the time  but the prices have gotten out of control. I used to split the Don Juan doe  3.75 and it is now  6.75. I would also get a single enchilada for  2.75. It was small but it tastes good. It is now  3.75 per enchilada. Pretty much everything is  1 to  1.50 more for no apparent reason. This place is just for visitors now.
Juan In A Million,120,Great brunch in Austin. The atmosphere is great and the food will put a smile on your face.
Juan In A Million,121,Great tacos  Happening place  Fresh food  Handmade tortillas  Very busy but they were quick with the food.
Juan In A Million,122,Incredible service  Even better taste   I crushed the don jaun and added steak instead of bacon   My wife loved the Don Juan also. Great atmosphere and helpful staff  
Juan In A Million,123,Food is ok. I waited 20 minutes for my food and when it came it was cold. It looked like it was the waiter s first day on the job. I had to remind him that we were waiting for our food.
Juan In A Million,124,Timing is key when you want to come here for breakfast  as we did. Got there about 9 45 and got seated right away. 10 minutes later there was a line and people waiting outside for a table. But it is worth the wait.  Great wait staff  very friendly  The food  great stuff and considering how busy they were it did not take a terrible long time. Boy the wait staff must put on miles a day   The food was very tasty and filling. I would definitely go back here. I would love to try it for lunch.
Juan In A Million,125,Juan in a Million has been around since before I moved to Austin in 2003 and I m an Original Gangster.  It has expanded since then obvs but I m not sure I like every single thing.  It s kind of one-note with the Don Juan taco really being the only thing that ruled about their food  no offense-they really made a funn taco salad when I asked to substitute potatoes and beans for chicken  but yeah not anything to be wildly writing great Yelp reviews of.  The Sanctuary building across the street made me think Jaun in A Million might be good..like helping women out of abusive relationships    My good pal Kim Kugler wanted to bring her dog Bella to brunch with us but the manager said she had to be able to perform at least two tasks that regular dogs can t and since she could only perform one task  she wasn t allowed so we ate brunch at Gabriela s    Meow.
Juan In A Million,126,Juan in a Million is the social fabric that keeps Austin warm.  As soon as you arrive Juan in a million  you are greeted by a bunch of smiles and hard working people ready to be of service.  You are greeted like if you are part of the family and the first thing a family does is feed you.   If you are in the mood for quality breakfast tacos burritos  I highly recommend Juan in a million.  If you are overwhelmed by the choices on the menu  just order the  Don Juan - El Taco Grande.  According to their Menu   It s a secret combination of potato  eggs  bacon  and cheese in a delicious hot tortilla.   My recommendation for you is to come hungry and be ready for a nap.  The portions are hearty and the tastes is great.  I usually avoid places with crowds but Juan in a Million has a very efficient serving system and they get patrons in and out.  The food is legit and the dinning experience is memorable.  Yelp tip   The early bird catches the breakfast burrito without the crowds.
Juan In A Million,127,Love this place  I came here with my cousins who are not from Texas and we had heard nothing but great things about this place and they were impressed. Breakfast tacos are a must and now my cousins understand why  haha. There s plenty of seating  great for group gatherings. Absolutely loved the horchata from here  so delicious  The food is delicious - and there s a lot of it too  Definitely a must try place in Austin  TX.
Juan In A Million,128,I think their selling point was big portion for a low price. It is perfect if you are local and want a big  good breakfast that doesn t break the bank  but I do not know if I would recommend it for tourists  especially if you are short on time and can only make it to so many places on your trip .   The service was great. We came on a Friday morning and had no wait. We were greeted right away and the server was very friendly and patient. Loved the diner  your neighborhood cafe environment here.  I got the con queso breakfast plate - it was about  10  but came with a lot of food. The plate came with refried beans  queso  breakfast potato  2 eggs  some kind of stewed beef  and 2 flour tortilla on the side. This one was a bit messy to eat but the general flavor was good. Again  it was A LOT OF food  so please come hungry.   He got the Don Juan which is egg  cheese  potato  and bacon on a big flour tortilla. Again  a lot of food  but not something you can t  is too difficult to make at home  but for about  7  it was definitely a good deal     Overall  I would prefer to check out other places when I m in Austin next  but definitely check it out if you have a lot of time in Austin and  or local 
Juan In A Million,129,Stopped in for the first time this week for lunch while working in the area.  What a great place. Enchiladas with tomatillo sauce was the best I ve had.  Service was super fast the air conditioning was perfect.  Wait staff awesome.  Price was reasonable and left big tip.   Will go again.
Juan In A Million,130,A timeless classic. Irresistible breakfast tacos. Spicy salsa. Silky queso. And an incredibly hard working staff. An absolute must try.
Juan In A Million,131,The food is amazing and the prices are just as good. The service was good and Juan greets you at the door friendly as if he s known you all of his life
Juan In A Million,132,Juan is very popular in Austin  and the wait definitely proved this  My party waited 30 min to be seated and probably another 30 till be placed our order. They serve  2.50 mimosas saturdays and sundays which were great  and we got their famous Don Juan taco which was pretty good  The taco is HUGE  so if you get it be sure to order more tortillas to make it into a couple of smaller tacos. I m sure Juan is better on other days with quicker service  but the long wait was it s only fault for me.
Juan In A Million,133,We were visiting Austin and heard it was a must to try out breakfast tacos. I let Yelp help me out and as usual  it was the right move.   Our party ordered breakfast tacos and coffee. I wasn t sure why my server asked me if I wanted extra tortillas  until my order arrived. The breakfast taco was huge. It was hot and tasted excellent with the house sauce. Everyone in my party was happy with our decision to eat at Juan s.  Here it comes...I hate that Yelp doesn t let me give half stars. Juan s is a solid 4.5 for me. Our coffee and meals were great  however  our service was a little slow and it took way too long to get more coffee. That said  our server was nice and helpful when we placed our orders. They appeared to have too many tables to juggle and may have needed help  or someone filling coffee.  I d definitely give Juan in a Million another try when I return to Austin.
Juan In A Million,134,I seen this place on an episode of Man vs. Food a few years back and knew I had to visit one day.  I know I m late to the party but I m not a local.  Better late than never  right   I purposely didn t eat the free breakfast at my hotel just so i would be hungry for one of those Don Juan grande breakfast tacos and was thinking I could eat maybe two of them.  Boy  was I wrong.   I ordered one Don Juan grande breakfast taco with extra tortillas.  I also got free chips and salsa.  The spicy salsa matched well with the taco.  The taco was predominantly potatoes.  It also had bacon  eggs and cheese mixed in.  This taco is huge and weighs at least 1 lb. each.  The potato mixture could have used more seasoning but I just added more salsa to it.  I should have asked if they have a green salsa as that would have matched well too  plus I m a big fan of salsa verde.  I think I ate only half the taco.  The taco won.  It is very filling to say the least.  I would rate my food as a 3-3.5  but will round up to 4  as the staff was very friendly and accommodating.  The place is spacious and lit well.
Juan In A Million,135,The staff is very nice and comfortable to joke around with. Food is also great  I alway get the Don Juan 
Juan In A Million,136,It was worth the wait.  The food and staff were so nice     You are so good   Food was on point   Nothing negative to say about them  Thanks
Juan In A Million,137,Really wanted to love this place  waited about 40 minutes for our table  sat down and got our drinks  but when it went downhill was that we waited over 20 minutes for anyone to come serve us. No one came to take our order  refill our drinks or check on us. I understand we are in a labor shortage but we literally had to flag down someone to take our order. Service was terrible. We will never be back.   This will make or break a establishment  it all comes down to service.
Juan In A Million,138,Juan you really outdid yourself this time I must say. Mark the reviewer checking in to tell you that this place is amazing. Food is very tasty and plentiful and it s all at a cheap price. For the Don Juan and horchata  I paid  10  not including tip . It comes with some chips that have the texture of Doritos and some spicy red salsa. The horchata is on the better end of horchata I ve had but I ve never had a bad horchata tbh. It s everything you need from horchata  cinnamon  milk  creamy  sweet  refreshing  ice cold. The Don Juan is the most popular thing here and for good reason. The portion size is insane and you should always get the extra tortillas when offered since one tortilla can t hold all of the big toppings. It s some special mixture of eggs  potatoes  cheese  and bacon and it just tastes better than any breakfast taco I can make. The ingredients are in a very nice ratio and nothing is overwhelming powerful. There might be other breakfast places with higher quality ingredients that taste more fresh but nothing can beat the portion sizes. For the cost  there are no complaints and everything is delicious. Customer service was great and quick and efficient. Parking spots are limited so try and come when it s less busy.
Juan In A Million,139,Excellent. My family loves this place and we have the same outstanding experience each time we eat here when we visit austin.
Juan In A Million,140,How to describe this place   well it was definitely not authentic and service was not the best   waitress needed to be flagged down a couple times to just get coffee refills and sugar. To my surprise nothing special and when we got our bill we were outraged overpriced for beef    lettuce and eggs. Definitely not worth the buck  
Juan In A Million,141,Came here for the first time and definitely was unexpected  the place looks small but was pretty spacious and had lots of seating outside and inside and all kinds. Do not be fooled by the menus and all of its different prices  the ones in store and online and at the table have all different prices.  Regardless  this place is overpriced.
Juan In A Million,142,  Tourist review from LA    Must order   Queso  It s a cute little hole in the wall.  I ordered the chicken enchilada and queso.  The salsa and queso are so good.  The salsa has a great kick to it and the queso has a runny smooth texture.  I filled up on these     The enchiladas are a little disappointing.  The green sauce was flavorless and the chicken was dry.    I would not come back but if I do... QUESO AND SALSA 
Juan In A Million,143,One of the best Mexican restaurants in Austin   The owner still works here. The service is very fast and the food is definitely worth it  
Juan In A Million,144,This place is THE BOMB  I highly recommend this place to everyone and I always bring my friends here from out of town whenever they re visiting. Service is phenomenal and everyone is so kind. Also   1.50 mimosas on Saturday s and Sunday s. Need I say more    The salsa is AMAZING  It is definitely on the spicier side  but it is so fresh and beautifully compliments any dish. I ordered the con queso breakfast and my brother ordered the steak breakfast. We were not disappointed. Portions are definitely generous and prices are unmatched.   I would also love to give a shout-out to these guys for taking COVID seriously and implementing masks and social distancing while dining at their establishment. As a nurse  I truly appreciated this. I ve seen many restaurants ignore the mask mandates and social distancing throughout the pandemic  so this was a refreshing sight to see. You guys will always have my business 
Juan In A Million,145,Stopped by for breakfast with the family. Was relatively busy but we were seated right away. It seemed like we were forgotten about for awhile  as we weren t approached by a waitress for around 20 minutes. But once she came  she was very apologetic and food arrived quickly after we ordered.   The breakfast was very good  but quite heavy. If you want breakfast tacos  they are quite large so you really only need two. The beans are also delicious.   If you re looking for a tasty and authentic breakfast  I would recommend 
Juan In A Million,146,This place is an Austin staple and for good reason. Let me start with the food... For my meal I had the Don Juan and a Bacon and Egg taco and they were both fantastic  The Don Juan was huge  In fact  I made 5 tacos out of it which is a lot of food for such a good price.  By far  the biggest plus of this place is the price. Here the prices are crazy cheap for the large portion of food that you are getting and the service is really quick    I will be back in the future for sure.  2 Pro-Tips  Try the corn tortillas and come hungry 
Juan In A Million,147,Doesn t look like much when I first saw it  I m not even a big fan of most taco places but I think this is some of the best Mexican food I ve had. There was a line out of the door but it went by fairly quickly. I ordered the Don Juan and it was super worth for  6.25. The plate comes full of their egg  potato  bacon  cheese mixture and you can add on tortillas if you need more. The filling is so good and even though it looks like they just put everything in a pot and mixed it  it tastes so good. Overall  would definitely come back again  only complaint is the line.
Juan In A Million,148,Went here for breakfast on a girls trip to Austin - soooo yummy  I always judge a Mexican place by their chips  amp  salsa. Let s just say Juan In a Million did not disappoint 
Juan In A Million,149,We don t travel to Austin much  but I can guarantee we will stop here the next time we are in town  Not only is the food amazing  but the owner is one of the nicest guys  You can see he takes real pride in his business. While we were eating I saw several people compliment the food and you can tell he took each of those compliments to heart  I am super picky on menudo  it has to be just right  and let me tell you this ranked 2nd  under my grandma s of course .  I 100  recommend stopping by any time you are in Austin 
Juan In A Million,150,I honestly wasn t impressed the way that I had hoped.  But then again  Cali mexican food is the best there is  Especially in the valley.  The portions were decent  the food was just decent and the salsa was too spicy for my taste buds to enjoy.  Plenty of room in the restaurant though.
Juan In A Million,151,This place is so OVERATED  Lol it s ok if you re not used to REAL Mexican cuisine. Tex Mex or not this place is disgusting   I ve had wayyyyy better Tex mex than this.We ordered breakfast and the beans tasted and looked like they were from a can. The potato s were either frozen or poorly cooked  Food overall had nothing authentic about it. I was clearly disappointed. Save your money and go to El Pastor in riverside for breakfast tacos 
Juan In A Million,152,I was met by Juan at the door  exactly how I was met by Juan  years ago. That s attention to detail.   Fajitas  5-stars Chicken enchilada  5- stars Service  5-stars Price  5-stars  Beware that there may possibly be a wait outside for breakfast on the weekend -- because this place is worth it.   I ll be back.
Juan In A Million,153,HOLY COW this place hits the spot for a belly-warming breakfast. I came here after a long morning hike and it was exactly what I needed. I got the con queso breakfast which comes with eggs  queso  carne guisada  beans  2 tortillas  and potatoes. Everything was great  The carne guisada was so tender and flavorful and the refried beans were perfect. Usually I m pretty picky about my refried beans  but just thinking about these makes me salivate. This entire plate was just amazing and I scarfed it down. I cannot wait to go back and eat this meal again    There was about a 20 min wait for a table  but the service was pretty quick. You immediately get chips and salsa when you sit down  so that should hold you over until the meal comes. There is outdoor seating available and the tables are pretty spaced out  so they re taking COVID precautions pretty seriously.
Juan In A Million,154,We were visiting and apparently  this is the place to go. I mean if its good enough for Man vs. Food it should be good enough for me.   The dish pretty much everyone gets is the Don Juan  which is basically eggs  bacon  and potatoes on a tortilla. The thing is massive and costs just under  7. Honestly  if it weren t for the food challenge hype  I don t think I would have come here just for a giant breakfast taco.   There wasn t much that was special about it  and about 1 3 of the way through it got really boring   there s no stomach space to order anything else if you get the Don Juan. I did appreciate that the horchata was good  also massive and only cost  2.50   I guess in the end I had a second meal that I ended up giving to someone in need. It s a solid place if you need a meal that s easy on the wallet.
Juan In A Million,155,SUPER HEARTY breakfast taco that my two friends and I could not even finish. It comes with everything you could possibly want in a classic breakfast burrito  from bacon to potatoes to egg and cheese. For only  6  this taco seriously can not be beat in terms of bang for your buck. Super delicious but SO heavy  definitely something I could only have a couple bites of.
Juan In A Million,156,Pretty good breakfast taco selection. Some of the other spots around are better overall but this is always a crowd pleaser.
Juan In A Million,157,Finally got to see what the hype was all about it. Came to this place on a Sunday  there was a decent wait. The service was amazing  however the food was just average  ordered ribeye dinner and chicken beef fajitas . The beef fajitas were pretty good  but I wouldn t recommend the chicken fajitas or ribeye dish. Next time we will have to try their breakfast dishes - since that s what they are known for. I can see why people enjoy coming here though - the atmosphere  very reasonable prices  and customer service is great 
Juan In A Million,158,The Breakfast Special is a must-have. Despite its simplicity  I found it very satisfying. The tortillas are thick and chewy  a classic combo with potatoes and beans.   Management has moved seating outside and the foldable tables that account for Covid take me back to the backyard meals of my youth  minus the blaring ranchera music and stumbling drunk uncles .   You d be foolish not to go.
Juan In A Million,159,Absolutely amazing breakfast taco  I bet you can t eat two of them.  Came here with family while I was on vacation and I know I will definitely come here every time I visit from now on. Huge portion for a great price  The food was absolutely perfect  Definitely a MUST try 
Juan In A Million,160,Wow the breakfast taco was huge  Seriously took 2 bites and I was full. It s a hot spot here in Austin for breakfast tacos  You definitely won t be disappointed if you came 
Juan In A Million,161,This restaurant is pretty good  I came in for breakfast on a weekday. The service was quick. The dish was average. Really like how spaced out the tables are on the inside. Their patio is pretty cool and has a good view of Cesar Chavez - I ll definitely be sitting out there when it warms up.
Juan In A Million,162,Although named Juan in a Million  this place is really just a 3 out of 5.  My first stop in Texas to grab some authentic Tex-Mex. Juan in a Million had a sizeable parking lot and plenty of seating both in and outdoor. That is about the only above average thing the had to offer.  The tacos I ordered were virtually indistinguishable from some I would get a Mexican restaurant in Virginia. The queso was uninspired and the rest of the food I can only describe as mediocre. While none of it was bad by any stretch of the imagination  it really did not live up to the hype.  If you are hungry and in the area I would recommend it but don t go out of your way.
Juan In A Million,163,Dined in today. Noticed immediately that the two patrons near us were talking about us. Talking about loving Trump  hating protestors  disrespected the staff etc. The typical racist shit. I was furious and couldn t eat  so we took it to go but before doing so my partner paid for their food and tipped the VERY calm and professional waitresses 40 bucks. We will be back as often as possible.   Who orders enchiladas without sauce 
Juan In A Million,164,My friends and I came here to try their food since I d heard this is an Austin thing to do  We ordered our own foods and i got 2 tacos. The waitresses gave us red and green salsa and chips while we waited for our food. The red salsa was so addictingly spicy  My friends couldnt handle it. The chips were delicious    It took awhile for our food to come out which was alittle disappointing because they weren t crazy busy. The waitresses still had time to stand and talk amongst each other and with another guest sitting at a nearby table. Once our food came out   everything was delicious    Service was mediocre  nothing astounding. I would probably be willing to try this place again just to try something else on their menu. And definitely go back to eat that salsa again 
Juan In A Million,165,Stopped in for breakfast on a girls trip in Austin. The Don Juan Taco Grande was SO good- and a huge portion.  Nothing fancy here  but good fast service.
Juan In A Million,166,We came for the big boy taco  The Don Juan. It didnt blow my mind  but it was decent. Needs more bacon IMO. They have the good kind of tortilla chips. Pricing was great. We will be back 
Juan In A Million,167,Good TexMex. Spicy Salsa. Not the best chips. Typical Mexican food. Flautas are ordinary as is the rice and beans. Was seated quickly
Juan In A Million,168,Soooo good. Went for a family trip to Texas to visit our son and ended up eating breakfast here every morning. Good and service was great  
Juan In A Million,169,I m fro LA and visited Austin with my friends and was STOCKED to try this place   I kept hying my friends up about it and when it was finally go time- we were very disappointed. The service was amazing and Juan  the owner was friendly. We just didn t have a taste for the food.  Queso  This was SUPER running. Is it meant to be that way  We were all really shocked because of the consistency. The flavor was decent but it didn t wow us- barely touched it.  Caldo De Res- I really enjoyed it. 2 of us ordered it and slurped it up. This was definetly our favorite dish.  Tacos- My fiance ordered 6 different tacos. They were HUGE but out of 6  he only liked one- which might ve been the Al Pastor.  Breakfast Special- Ordered by the rest of us and was barely touched. The taste wasn t memorable and dare I say that it was bland  compare to the other things we ve tasted in LA.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things and should ve asked for recommendations  I ll give it another try  if i visit again  because I REALLY wanted to like it. Their Micheladas were good tho 
Juan In A Million,170,We stayed at the most perfect place in the most perfect location while in Austin. Juan in a Million was around the corner from us. I saw the reviews while looking for a close place for breakfast. This joint came up and we thought  why not.  They have a lot of indoor and  outdoor   under a pavilion it looked like  seating. We got there and it was about a 15 minute wait. With the line out the door I was expecting longer. I was pleasantly surprised because the wait was faster than 15 minutes.  The server sat us down and brought us a complementary basket of chips and homemade salsa. I was delighted and was hungry so I dug in. WRONG idea. That salsa was hot as heck. So  so  so spicy. I was not expecting that at all. When I realized I went in slower not scooping big chips full if salsa. Once that was realized I was good.  I ordered the one breakfast that was the Don Juan  El Taco Grande. I got it with corn tortillas. It was so big we could have just shared that    The food was so good. I went through most of the tacos and took the rest home. Man  if I was a local I would be back more often   I m happy I found it and I m happier we came  
Juan In A Million,171,Chips were crispy and fresh  salsa was spicy. Horchata was huge and def worth it. Chalupa is a pretty big portion but not super amazing. All in all good bang for the buck and the atmosphere. Outdoor dining only so wouldn t go on a really hot day.
Juan In A Million,172,Juan is so nice and runs a great restaurant  the food is so good . The waitstaff is top notch   I really enjoy the ambiance and everything this place has to offer.
Juan In A Million,173,Must go place in Austin  Great food  super large portions for the price  spacious restaurant and great service. I got the Don Juan taco grande and it was only  6.25 and I couldn t finish all the food  a huge plate of eggs  cheese  potatoes  and bacon with two tortillas on the side  It was delicious and just what I needed after a night out  Our food came with large portions of chips and salsa which is what I always want. My friends got the chorizo con huevos and the con queso breakfast plate which were also delicious. This is a popular place so we had to wait outside for a while but there is lot of space inside. Definitely recommend especially for the price 
Juan In A Million,174,The wait staff was very attentive  we were seated very quickly  and our food came out promptly on a Sunday afternoon visit. I got the chalupas and iced tea. It was nothing fancy  but still tasty.
Juan In A Million,175,Amazing everything. Fast friendly service. Excellent Tex-Mex food. One of Austin s landmark restaurants. Try the Don Juan taco.
Juan In A Million,176,I ve been wanting to come here for soo long and we finally did. My wife and I where not disappointed. We waited for about 20 mins and they welcomed us was very friendly. Their customer service was awesome and the food was very delicious. Thanks to the staff and to Juan we will be back.
Juan In A Million,177,Loved this place   The owner was amazing  hilarious  and super sweet. Best of all  the portions are absolutely humongous and delicious  We will definitely be back next time we re in town.
Juan In A Million,178,Not a bad place at all. Super wallet friendly and doesn t taste bad either. The Don Juan was huge and definitely shareable. I think the only problem I had with it was how big it was. The first taco was amazing but by the time I got to the third one  it began to taste the same hahah so next time I ll share with a friend. Also I wish there was a little less potato and a bit more eggs but it was still tasty nonetheless.   Oh and Juan is suuuuper friendly  he really makes you feel welcomed so that s bonus points there. There is a bit of a wait so be ready for that but it s worth it 
Juan In A Million,179,Great service and super yummy tacos. We had the chicken tacos and the beef tacos and they were both delicious  We went back the next morning for the breakfast tacos. I got the bacon  egg and cheese breakfast taco and it was literally the BEST BREAKFAST TACO I d ever had  It had this really unique smoky flavor that I can t really put into words  but you just have to try it  I can t wait to go back to Austin so that I could have that bad boy again 
Juan In A Million,180,Poor service and staff very rude...waitress never came back with my drink or sugar for coffee  had to ask another waitress...waitress completely ignored me twice...horrible service  do not recommend
Juan In A Million,181,Depends when you go but sometimes there s a huge wait to get inside and understandably so  Their Don Juan has been featured many times and it s so good. You get so much food for so little - with eggs  cheese  potato  and bacon  You can make minimum 3 tacos out of it. You ll have to come try it out yourself. The horchata is also a big size and so tasty. I never try anything else when I come because I know I ll leave satisfied if I order these. Only complaint is the back building smells a bit and it was very evident when we were seated there.
Juan In A Million,182,I ve been told I should eat Tex Mex because why not  We were in Texas after all. So  consider this an obligatory meal more than anything.   We were brightly greeted by the owner himself as he said  Welcome  come on in  . He shook our hands before asking us how many were in our party. Talk about warm hospitality. From that and the servers calling customers by name  I instantly knew they were not just famous to visitors but to locals as well.    6 for a behemoth of a dish called DON JUAN TACO EL GRANDE is the most popular thing on the menu. It s a mixture of potato  egg  bacon  and cheese on a tortilla that could easily feed two mouths. Make sure to add guac for that extra something  something. If you ask me  I think the price is what makes this special  otherwise  everything about it is pedestrian. By a mile  I preferred the CHORIZO w  EGG TACO   2.69  when it came to flavor. While they had unlimited chips and salsa on the house  we also ordered their QUESO which turned out to be really tasty but very watery.   Not my best meal on this trip but I guess you can say I had Tex Mex while in Austin..
Juan In A Million,183,This place is SO GOOD. I got the migas with cheese  which also came with a huge portion of home fries and refried beans. The migas were so cheesy and comforting  and the refried beans were some of the best I ve had. The rest of my table got the Don Juan  which was absolutely massive but tasty- definitely heavy on the potatoes  though. I preferred the migas  but you really can t beat the price of the Don Juan   6 for a small mountain of food .   Your food also comes with fresh chips and salsa- the salsa is a great addition to anything else on the table  I really liked it on top of the migas . The drinks are surprisingly good  too  I really liked the coffee  and do NOT miss the fantastic horchata. Everything is so reasonably priced  the portions are large  and the service is really nice. Definitely worth the wait 
Juan In A Million,184,One of the first spots I heard I had to hit in Austin  this amazingly named joint has appeared on television shows with its divey and lively character in a humbly large interior  but I can t say I felt any of the magic. I got three different breakfast tacos  no migas though  and all were decent but nothing great or extraordinary. Just good and simple. Chips and salsa were fine. If this was a lowkey local spot I m sure I d hit it for decent Mexican but wasn t finding anything worthy of the reputation here and the line is too long for me to really feel like coming back. Maybe a local can tell me what I missed here or if it truly is just a tourist one-and-done spot with better options elsewhere  Tyson s anyone  .  Still  loved coming here for the experience and nothing was bad in the slightest. After you eat you pay up front  so don t feel bad if a waitress doesn t come around to collect your money after you get the check.
Juan In A Million,185,This place is deserved for its hype and always busy. Very unassuming place on a small road  but it s huge and always full. Being greeted and taken t your table by the very sociable and loving owner was a treat. Good fresh chips and tasty salsa was enjoyed. Of course I had the Don Juan El Grande taco which was simple and so tasty  but to me the star was the beef enchiladas. So staty  also tex-mexish. Loved its sauce. Will visit again and again.
Juan In A Million,186,The wait was only 10 minutes on a weekday lunch. Service was very prompt. Got our chips and salsa very quickly. Food took longer to come out. I ordered the Don Juan which is enough to make more than 5 tacos. Kinda of plain to me. It s just impressive how much filling they give you. It s great at its price point but flavor wise was just ok. Maybe it needed more seasoning  I got bored of it pretty quickly. Definitely get this to share since the portion was so big. My friends enjoyed their meal. The soul was hearty and came loaded with toppings. A pretty good place to share some hangover breakfast tacos with friends 
Juan In A Million,187,Juan in a million is like a place you have to try for some real cheap breakfast Mexican tacos. They are famous for this one massive plate of scrambled eggs  potatoes  bacon with tortillas. I got that and 2 Barbacoa tacos and shared with a friend. We put some of the barbacoa meat in the tortilla with the egg potato bacon mix and it was amazing. Made like 5 to 6 tacos. They also give chips and salsa which was good too. It was so filling  it kept us full for a long time.  There is parking at the back of the restaurant and lots of seating in the resturant 
Juan In A Million,188,One of the few restaurants open for dine in Memorial Weekend 2020.  Great brunch place
Juan In A Million,189,This place is an Austin classic  The portion size is huge  I ordered two tortillas on the side when I should have ordered three tortillas instead. The Don Juan taco grande was around  6.25 but like one of their tacos was like 4 tacos for me. My friends and I had to Togo the rest home. It had potatoes  eggs  bacon  and cheese. Next time I would just split a plate with someone. Their salsa is spicyyyyy but that s how I like it. I love this place   Follow me on insta  eatwithlilz   eatwithlilz
Juan In A Million,190,Decided to give this place a try after reading some of these raging reviews. Do not be fooled.   Austin has so many great authentic Mexican eateries - this is not one of them.   The  complimentary  chips and salsa taste like something I can get from the grocery store. Neither the flour or corn tortillas are freshly made.   I ordered the Huevos Rancheros off the breakfast menu. The salsa was cold and the potatoes are probably frozen-bought.   Decided to give this review 3 stars because the service was pretty great.  I won t be coming back to Juan in a Million.
Juan In A Million,191,Don Juan plate is big enough for two to share - just add 5 tortillas. Be sure to split the last one as it s the tortilla that takes on the flavor of the big ol pile of filling. Most people get one to themselves to take more home.  Friendly service and an East Austin landmark. Locals frequent here.
Juan In A Million,192,Tex Mex breakfast  I never even thought of having breakfast tacos until i heard of this joint. we came early so there was no wait  Free chips and spicyyy salsa while you wait don juan el grande taco  they sure do have a tasty mixture of meat and potatoes. It seemed more like a breakfastplate than a taco  this thing is huge  You really could share with someone else migas taco with cheese  more like a breakfast taco to me  i liked the egg mixture  Their flour tortillas are huge so this taco alone was enough for me  NOTE  they drop the check at your table but you pay at the front register
Juan In A Million,193,I ve been coming here for more than 20 years. Not as much lately as I used to but I did go this morning and it was wonderful  To the friendly staff and the owner  applause  applause .  You made another satisfying start to my day 
Juan In A Million,194,This place is honestly the best. The staff is super friendly  and on the off chance that you meet Juan himself  be sure to give him a good hard handshake   But he ll probably beat you to it   The Don Juan is a humongous taco - it s basically a burrito filling inside of a taco tortilla  and it is SO good. I know it looks like a mess in my pictures  but it s god potatoes  bacon  cheese  and some other great stuff my mind can t even process because it s busy sending me orders to keep eating. What my friends and I like to do is order the Don Juan and some tortillas on the side  then split the filling between the extra tortillas. One Don Juan comes out to 4-5 tacos if you do it right.  Comes with tortilla chips and salsa. Beware of the salsa if you re not great with spicy food.
Juan In A Million,195,An Austin tradition   A quick and easy tex-mex breakfast for your daily Austinite or traveling tourist in the East Austin area.  Come for the Don Juan to get the best value for your morning afternoon. Make sure to get a couple extra tortillas for your mountain of eggs  potatoes  and cheese. Complimentary chips and salsa is spicy   Staff is friendly and space is homey. Take a scooter to see other parts of East Austin.
Juan In A Million,196, Why haven t I eaten here before   That s what I asked myself after having brunch at Juan in a Million last week. When I walked in  I was greeted by a gentleman  maybe Juan    and he was so friendly and welcoming. My friends had a table on the patio so he showed me the way.   Everything on the menu sounded so good. I decided to do the con queso breakfast  eggs  carne guisada  refried bean  potatoes  two flour tortillas . I was feeling gluttonous so I added a side of bacon lol. It was sooooo good  The portions are generous and it held me over for most of the day. I love a good Tex Mex breakfast.   We tried the tres leches cake. The cake itself was good  the icing was okay. It would have been fine without the icing because the cake was moist  the milk dripped out when we dug our fork into it .   Parking wasn t an issue  but it was a Monday afternoon. I imagine it could be difficult on weekends. I can t believe it s taken me so long to eat at Juan in a Million. It s one of those Austin staples that I hope never goes away  It reminds me of the Austin I grew up in.
Juan In A Million,197,I really wanted to like this place but the food was So Disappointing  We had the Go-to Juan Taco- although the taco itself looked awesome it was very bland. The eggs and the papas had no taste. It s so hard to get those two simple things wrong. I worry they re just trying to run a fast production  get you in and out  that the food is suffering. Don t get me wrong I appreciate a business that has operations down to a T  but you should never sacrifice quality. Coffee tasted as if the grounds were used for multiple carafes. Beans were the only thing that had good flavor.
Juan In A Million,198,An Austin Staple   If you looking for the best bang for your buck  Don Juan plate  is the way to go. With the amount of tacos you can make with it  it s worth the price.   I love how they give you complimentary chips and salsa. The tortilla chips are very fresh. It came out warm and crispy. The salsa is deliciously spicy. If you can t handle the heat  their guacamole is definitely worth.   The staffs are very hospitable. Although the restaurant looks packed and looks like they have a long wait  stick around because they seat you pretty fast. Worth the wait 
Juan In A Million,199,The food was AMAZING    First off the service was superb  our waitress was on top of it  She was very efficient  and friendly. We were given salsa and chips to start  and the salsa was SO good  I ordered the breakfast tacos potato egg  and added cheese  my boyfriend had the con queso breakfast. They were both great and served to us within 5 minutes of ordering. All the ingredients were fresh and at perfect temperature. If you re ever in Austin and looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant stop by this place. It is a hidden gem.
Juan In A Million,200,Lunch on a weekday. Fajitas and tacos.   Service was fast. Greeted immediately  sat and drinks served within minutes. Everyone was friendly. Small inside but it wasn t too crowded at 11am. Chips and spicy salsa served quickly and order promptly taken.   As far as customer service  this place is top notch. No complaints about that  Food was okay. I expected more since I ve heard so many good things and I m probably unfairly comparing it to what I m used to getting in S Texas. My fajitas did not come out on a hot comal. They just came plated. Flavor was okay. Husband s tacos were very good. Food was hot  amp  fresh. Prices were a bit higher than I m used to. Expect  10  each.   Overall  I may go back to try breakfast just because the customer service was great. I want to like this place 
Juan In A Million,201,This place lived up to the hype    So delicious.  We stopped in this morning and ordered the Don Juan with four extra tortillas  it comes with only one  and it was more than enough for to share. We loved that the salsa was spicy and it was a great addition to the tacos as well.   I ve been to a number of breakfast taco places around town lately  but none have seasoned their food as well as Juan in a Million. The eggs were fluffy  it was savory from the bacon  and the potatoes were hearty and filling. The extra tortillas were just enough -- when the plate came  I was worried it wouldn t be enough food  but it was perfect.   Service was a bit lacking absent even though it wasn t super busy  but it was no big deal. I ll be back soon to try the horchata  Super affordable  delicious  and we love supporting local businesses 
Juan In A Million,202,This is THE Tex Mex we were looking for when we were visiting Austin. Super authentic  affordable  and flavorful Mexican food. We started with chips salsa  and queso. Beware the salsa is spicy  But the queso might have been the best we ve ever had  and we eat a lot of queso . Nothing like how it s made in Florida. I got two chalupas and added ground beef and quac. The other person I was with ordered the Carne Guisada  which was immediately devoured. This place has a long history - open since 1980. Definitely a place to grab some good  hearty Mexican food     
Juan In A Million,203,This place was full of amazing food and hospitality. My friends and I were leaving Austin when we tried it out and let s just say that I regret that we didn t go there on out first day visiting. Everyone was so nice and treated customers like family. What stood out to me the most was Juan walking around and checking on his guests. That says a lot about an owner. The cashier greeted with the most welcoming smile and asked how was the food afterwards. I plan to visit Austin again and this restaurant will definitely be on my list.
Juan In A Million,204,This was recommended by a friend  and WOW was the food delicious  Our group enjoyed menudo  caldo de res  Don Juan el taco grande  Machacado con huevo AND topped it all of with  1.50 mimosas since it was Sunday  Will definitely go back next time we re in Austin 
Juan In A Million,205,Back to 5 stars.  Get the El Taco Grande and ask for chorizo instead of sausage. Amazing   
Juan In A Million,206,I m from the valley  5 hours south of Austin by the border. So my standards are very high when it comes to Mexican food. This place hit all the right spots  The barbacoa was clean and the serving was big and they were even kind enough to serve my menudo with ONLY hominy after asking because I don t really care for the meat that menudo comes with  personal preference . 10 10
Juan In A Million,207,This is one of our favorite places to get brunch  The Don Juan is one of the best breakfast tacos out there in Austin  and it s legendary for a reason. It is stuffed with eggs  potatoes  cheese  bacon  all wrapped in a warm flour tortilla. The salsa is the perfect amount of spiciness to top onto the taco. Ordering extra tortillas is recommended for all the scraps that fall off too. The kitchen is always very efficient and we never have to wait long for food. Even though the line looks long on weekends  things move quickly.  Definitely try this place when you are visiting Austin and want to try a spot that does breakfast tacos the right way.
Juan In A Million,208,This place is really good   The service is excellent and food is good     Authentic home made food except the tortilla  felt like store bought . Our group had breakfast items  lunch items as well as dinner items  yes they close   3 pm but do serve dinner items .  Was able to meet Mr. Juan when we were leaving.
Juan In A Million,209,While visiting Austin  I m happy that I had the opportunity to visit this place. The chips and salsa are amazing  Beware  the salsa is spicy but worth the burn  I ordered chicken flautas and they were absolutely delicious 
Juan In A Million,210,When I told my boyfriend that I wanted to visit Austin. He agreed under the one condition that we try Juan In A Million. That might be one of the best ideas he s ever had.  When we got there at 12 10 pm on a Sunday and there were a lot of people waiting outside. Don t be confused by the line that is formed because there is no line. Just walk in and put your name down and they ll call you in. When we came in  the owner  I think  informed us that the wait will be around 15 minutes. Really not bad for a Sunday afternoon   We were seated in the covered area outside. Thank god they have fans out there  The waitress was very nice and fast-paced. My boyfriend got the Don Juan taco and I got the Con Queso Breakfast Plate. The Don Juan really is as huge as they say  It was bigger than the plate  Our waitress recommended for my boyfriend to order extra tortillas and he was glad he did because he got 3 tacos out of that plate. My Con Queso Breakfast was good  but nothing too exciting. It was a mix of eggs  beans  carne guisada  and lots of Queso. The menu labeled it as one of the favorites so I tried it out. It was good  but I kinda wish I got something else.  We also ordered a side of Queso to eat with the chips and that was delicious as well. Their complimentary salsa was great but super spicy  I eat tons of spice and even I thought it was hot. Oh and get the lemonade  It s super refreshing for a sunny day   Overall  we were happy with the experience and we will be back the next time we re in Austin. The service  food  and atmosphere was great and we were satisfied with our trip.  Get the Don Juan taco for sure  cause it truly is JUAN IN A MILLION.
Juan In A Million,211,Not impressed. Don t waste your time in line or your money for bellow average food. Service was OK. Hot sauce was good but the migas and Don Juan were cold  over cooked  disappointing and not worth the price. After 32 years we will not return.
Juan In A Million,212,In the 1960s  Juan In A Million would be basic. In millennial obsessed hipster East Austin  it s a legend. Its fluorescent light is now the subject of millions of Instagram photos  which I fell prey.  It s a diner with no thrills....at all. You sit in old  dirty booths  but people love it. The moment you sit down  one of the servers quickly comes to start the process of moving you in and out.   Minutes later I was eating a plate of machacado con huevo. Each piece of this dish was slopped onto the plate  but together it was a decent breakfast. The server kept my mug filled with the worst coffee I had in ATX.  Despite all of this  the experience was one my millennial spirit craved. No thrills  1960s  diner food. I paid up front and left satisfied.
Juan In A Million,213,Very bad service. When we ordered we asked for tres leches with our order and the waitress said she would check and never came back only to deliver our food and immediately run off. She never came back again only to just to leave the check on the table say nothing and leave. Very disappointed in this place   
Juan In A Million,214,This Tex Mex restaurant is not only delicious  but amazing friendly as well. You could feel it the moment you walk in. On the last day of my trip to Austin  my group decided to get breakfast before we checked out of our Airbnb. One of our drivers recommended this place to us because it was near where we stayed and it as an Austin favorite.   Right when we opened the doors to go in  the owner greeted everyone with a smile and handshake. It was an amazing feeling because not too many owners greet all their customers and he was so enthusiastic about it too. We arrived around noon and the place was pretty packed. The menu had your typical Tex Mex dishes but we wanted some breakfast. Two of my friends ordered the Don Juan and I ordered the Migas. The dishes came out pretty quick. All our dishes came with two flour tortillas. The food was awesome and just what we wanted. My eggs were perfectly seasoned and scrambled. The onions and tomatoes were refreshing and provided a balance to the savoriness of the eggs and cheese. The dish also came with a side of refried beans and potatoes. After a few bites I was stuffed but I kept eating because it was so good.   At the end of the meal  everyone was in food coma. We had smiles on our faces even though we were all uncomfortably stuffed. This is a great spot if you love breakfast and Mexican food.
Juan In A Million,215,Stumbled upon Juan In A Million because we saw the SUPER long line outside of it. Thank goodness because this place is great    The tables turnover pretty quickly so we didn t wait more than 5 mins  and we quickly just ordered whatever was recommended sounded good. We ordered the Don Juan Breakfast Taco which is HUGE. It can easily feed 2 people. I need to figure out how they make it because it is that good. We also got a barbacoa taco and it was SOOO flavorful and delicious. They were super generous in their meat portion too.   I wish I had more time in Austin to go back while I was there  but until next time 
Juan In A Million,216,It just depends on what you re looking for in Juan in a Million. If you re looking for authentic Mexican food  this is probably not high in your standards. However  this place won me over with the cheap prices and vibes.   We came here for Saturday brunch and was met with a 20-minute wait which went by really fast. We got lucky and was able to sit in the main restaurant in the corner booth. The servers were all busy but were very attentive. We proceeded to fill our stomachs with the unnecessary chips and salsa. The heat of the salsa took me off guard. My mouth was on fire but in a good way    4 5  QUESO  Not sure how much it was but it came in a small bowl. The salsa came in a bigger bowl. It had a very buttery taste. My friend loved it so much she said she would bathe in it.   4 5   DON JUAN EL TACO GRANDE  Definitely a sharing portion but I conquered it all by myself. I opted to not get extra tortillas. I just ate it with a fork.    You have to pour the salsa and queso over this and just eat it. It s pretty amazing     5 5  HORCHATA  I highly recommend  It was the best horchata I ve ever had. For only  2 it came in a cup bigger than my water. I drank as much as I could and still had a full cup to go. I would probably get this every time I go to Juan in a Million.   My friend said her Rib Steak Breakfast was mediocre and my other friend had the barbacoa taco and wasn t a fan. Not sure how they would rate this place but for me it was a 5 out of 5.
Juan In A Million,217,The owner came over and personally greeted me while I was admiring the picture of him with Adam Richman. He cares about the customers  best service you could ask for. Also  the breakfast taco special was soo good   Great experience
Juan In A Million,218,Great food  specially breakfast tacos   great portions and some of the fairest prices in town. Plus Don Juan is always there with the biggest smile on his face and always makes you feel like family 
Juan In A Million,219,When first arrived to Austin  we had to stop at Juan in a Million for their famous breakfast   We had a big party and they accommodated us and took really good care of our table   I had the following   DON JUAN EL TACO GRANDE - A secret combination of potato  egg  bacon and cheese in a deliciously hot tortilla - this is a huge portion   So come hungry  because this deliciously well seasoned dish will fill you up   Great place to fuel up for a breakfast
Juan In A Million,220,This place really impressed me  so much my friends and I went three times.  Each time the food was awesome  the staff were friendly and attentive.     My favorite part is the owner stands at the front and greets everyone with a solid handshake and a hug.  He is upbeat  super friendly  and will make your shitty day immediately better.  His attitude is infectious.     I tried three different meals that were all delicious.   My friends all stayed with the same meal and said each time was Super good.    This place is an absolute must try when you are in Austin.
Juan In A Million,221,Pretty darn good  Food was yummy and horchata was huge. I give it four stars for what it is. This is not a brunch spot and it s not trying to be. Beer and margs are available but wouldn t drink those with breakfast.   We ordered the Don Juan and it created about 3 tacos so keep that in mind. Order it with extra tortillas.   The guac was yummy and simple. Salsa is hot  Prices are low. Horchata was only  2.25 for a massive glass    My brother got the Con Queso meal and ate the entire thing. Overall  we only waited 20 mins on a Saturday at 11 30am.  If you are looking for cheap and yummy authentic Mexican breakfast food  hit up Juan in a Million.
Juan In A Million,222,I really enjoyed my meal here. I had the beef fajita plate. Everything was seasoned to perfection. The salsa is super spicy....great for me because I love spicy food. I got here at about 11 am on a Saturday. There was about a 20 minute wait but we ll worth it. The service was not great but they were very busy.
Juan In A Million,223,Great place for quality tex-mex at reasonable prices. On this particular visit I got breakfast tacos which felt very ample in size  super cheesy  and packed with fillings such as eggs and cheese  potato egg and cheese  and a chorizo variety. Have been for lunch before in the past and it was good as well. As soon as you sit down you get chips and salsa. Service is pretty quick no matter when you go.
Juan In A Million,224,One of my favorite places on earth  Juan In A Million is in the Holly neighborhood  about 1.7 miles from downtown Austin. There are a few parking options out front on Cesar Chavez  and they have a lot at the back. Credit cards are accepted.   Food  You can t go wrong with much here. Tacos and the huevos rancheros are what we typically order. The ranchero sauce has a little heat to it  refried beans are perfectly refried      Service  Attentive  and drinks get refilled often. Food comes out quickly  even when they are packed.   Cost  Three tacos  a huevos rancheros with a side of bacon  two sweet teas ran us  32 after tax.   Overall  A must try when in Austin. Weekend mornings are busier  but the line moves quickly.
Juan In A Million,225,The wait is worth the food and the service. We maybe had 3 different waitresses. They were all friendly and fast. I went for breakfast  and it which was great. They seem to have an overall fantastic menu 
Juan In A Million,226,Nothing better than a GIANT breakfast taco. Tip for new costumers  their salsa is really good but each bite comes with a KICK
Juan In A Million,227,So freaking good and so affordable  Cute patio seating  Get there early to beat the crowd.
Juan In A Million,228,I love the authenticity of this place  It s also deceivingly big inside  There are sooo many seating options inside and even an outdoor covered area  This place is on the Austin Bucket List and after living here for 4 years  I finally decided to try it.   Pros   - Pretty cheap  you can get a huge cup of Horchata for  2.50. And it s super refreshing and delicious  - Endless amount of delicious chips and salsa that actually has a kick to it - HUGE portions  I ordered the Don Juan Taco - It s basically eggs  potato  bacon  and hella cheese served on top of a tortilla. You need about 4 tortillas to finish it all.  ask for extra tortillas  - I asked for salsa  and they gave me some green salsa that was super delicious  ask for it if you like spice - Every employee was super friendly and helpful  Cons   - You have to pay your ticket at the register which took longer than the wait to get a table - This was kind of inconvenient - There are many seating options  but if you sit in the entrance near the door  you are pretty crammed in there and you have people hovering over you waiting in line at the register so that can get annoying too  Overall  this place is a gem and everyone loves it for a reason    
Juan In A Million,229,So much food  So good. The salsa was super hot tho  Beware  1.50 mimosa on Sunday  Yum yum 
Juan In A Million,230,I cannot for the life of me understand how a Mexican restaurant like this one can have 4 stars.   First off- how can you claim you with a straight face to make your tortillas fresh and homemade on the premises and turn around and serve crappy store bought chips AND taco shells   Shameful.  The retried beans were without flavor at all- unless you consider a burnt smoke taste to be a flavoring.  The guacamole lacked any salt or flavor  disappointing and bland.  My tacos actually had American cheese on them  it should be real cheese.   I was hoping for a tasty homemade experience here at Juan s but was instead was treated to lunch at the Tia s house that the whole familia knows can t cook.
Juan In A Million,231,After hearing so many things about Juan in a Million  my boyfriend and I had to try it out for ourselves.   We showed up at about 9am on Labor Day  a Monday  and there was not parking left on the street or in their lot. We found some street parking a little far  on a not so good looking street. Once we got inside there was no wait  we were seated right away and taken care of by a very friendly waitress.  We got free chips and salsa before our meal. The salsa had great flavor but was WAY to spicy for both of us  and we can usually handle any salsas .  My boyfriend and I both ordered the Con Queso Breakfast  mine without meat . We both agreed it was delicious and enjoyed most of our plates.  We did enjoy our food but would keep driving by if we saw the normal crowd waiting outside.
Juan In A Million,232,The Don Juan was delicious  We ordered takeout from inside and ate it at home. The inside was cute and employees were very nice 
Juan In A Million,233,Juan in a Million has it right with the name as a play on  one in a million.  Truly  this is a special place. Be careful with this establishment because the rare combination of deliciousness  affordability  and good service will have you addicted after the first crunch of a tortilla chip.  Juan in a Million boasts a humble  homey interior which represents the treatment and feelings you will get from eating there  loving  Mexican home cooked goodness. I will go to no other place for tacos after discovering Juan in a Million. The tortilla chips are tasty  warm  and perfectly crunchy. Pair them with the always perfectly done guacamole  or with the standard hot sauce if you re not looking to splurge on some fancy guac.  Order a taco and feel a sense of happiness when the generous portion sizes match the generous taste. The simple shredded chicken taco boasts the most flavorful and voluptuous chicken portion. I personally also love the Machacado. My husband always goes for the legendary Don Juan  which is a divine combination of bacon  potato  egg  and cheese on a taco.  This place is friendly to vegans as well. Just not friendly to dogs. Bring your vegan friends but don t bring your friends who take their dogs everywhere. Although they have an indoor patio  no dogs are allowed.  There is nothing that I d change about Juan in a Million. Thus  I give 5 stars for this perfect establishment.
Juan In A Million,234,Just moved to ATX and we knew that Juan in a Million was going to be our first stop  We loved the Don Juan  I added pico  my mother in law added salsa and my husband ate it as is for the perfect breakfast for everyone  Can t wait to go back   We got it to go  thank you to those working and keeping us all going during the pandemic   frontlines  
Juan In A Million,235,Delicious  hole-in-the-wall   grandma s cooking  type of place.   EVERYTHING IS TO DIE FOR   I will admit I came because it was on Man Vs. Food way back in the day--it did not disappoint   Everyone in your party will find something to enjoy from their menu.  INSANELY crowded at times  but well worth the wait.
Juan In A Million,236,This place gives you the best bang for your buck. Everything is extremely cheap and it s all really delicious. All the food tastes fresh and the service is really quick.  The Don Juan breakfast taco is probably their best deal. For around  6  you get a giant serving of eggs  bacon  potatoes  and cheese  plus 3 tortillas to eat it all with. It is super filling and if you eat one  you will probably be full until dinner.   If you want something a bit more authentic  they also have Mexican options. If you want to try something different  their machacado is eggs scrambled with dried beef  onions  tomatoes  and peppers and it is delicious. If you want something simple  try the nopalitos  scrambled eggs with cactus strips. If you don t feel like eggs  their barbacoa is delicious. And of course if you come here  you have to get the horchata  a sweet cinnamon drink  to wash all of the food down.
Juan In A Million,237,This place is just a go to spot for some Mexican food. Oh man the food was amazing. Each bite was a bite with incredible flavor. This place is a must visit in the ATX. Let s just say it HITS   
Juan In A Million,238,After 8 years away from Austin  I am glad to see Juan In A Million has stayed consistently delicious. Coming into this place brings me back to my college years of being able to get delicious and huge tacos as a great place. The breakfast tacos are still huge  location is still the same  And most importantly  Juan is still there with a smile. The breakfast tacos are huge  enough to share between two girls. Definitely a place to go every time I visit
Juan In A Million,239,Simply  WOW      We were heading to the airport and decided it would be best to eat before we hit the airport as last time we ate there we saw a roach walking across the food at the bbq place  yuck    Juan s is maybe a 10-12 min drive to from the airport.  Anyway  this place looks like it could be a  shit hole  but I swear  it isn t   The food is f n on point   I m not much for eggs but good lord  the Don Juan El Taco Grande was amazing    I was going to order some beef tacos but at the last minute decided I d try what they are famous for.  It was the perfect amount of cheese  potato  egg and bacon.  I added guacamole and that was like the icing on the cake     You add a little of their fresh made hot sauce that comes with the chips and you will be one happy camper   I ordered the extra tortillas but truly they were not necessary.  I couldn t even eat the one it came with.  The taco is huge     Seriously  the balance of each item in this  taco  is perfect.  It s not overly eggy or bacony  yeah  it s a word in our home .  My husband who isn t a huge fan of Mexican food like I am even said his chicken quesadilla was awesome.  Joanna was out waitress and couldn t be any friendlier.  Everyone from the time we walked in till we walked out was friendly.  Next trip to Austin  we will stop by Juan s as soon as we land   
Juan In A Million,240,Our son brought us here and what a diamond in the ruff. If your in a hurry this is not the place. Lots of folks waiting to taste this delicious Mexican food. The owner shook our  hands as soon as we walked in to be seated. We had the queso breakfast and chorizo breakfast. Yummy we will be back next time we are on the area 
Juan In A Million,241,My son and I visited the last time I was in town and we experienced the Don Juan  Wow. The secret recipe is super duper. I brought my wife this time around and we expanded our horizons with the chicken entire and menudo. Breakfast lunch and dinner entrees are all hits. There is a good chance we will return before we roll out of town tomorrow.
Juan In A Million,242,This places rocks and I would put it in one of the best breakfasts I ve ever had  Service was great  portions were huge  great Tex mex  and then...We let Juan. This guy is so genuine and kind and made our time even more enjoyable. He knows how to treat people and I really think they ve nailed down how to make people feel when they come into your restaurant. Hope this place feels as good as we did 
Juan In A Million,243,I ve been coming here since I was a kid  amp  it s still my favorite breakfast taco in town. Even their cheese is phenomenal. The call ahead ordering is always so easy  amp  convenient when I don t have the time or patience to wait in the  well deserved  line.
Juan In A Million,244,Good service  good chips and salsa. Breakfast tacos were just okay and I had expected better flavor. Price was very inexpensive.
Juan In A Million,245,I have been to this place two times and sadly both times was a disappointment. I order a guacamole taco and a carne guisada taco. The taco s came without any salsa  and the tortillas were out of the fridge. I don t mean room temperature  I mean they were COLD as when you take them out of the fridge. Also  do not expect any side like lettuce or pico to add to your taco. That is a separate order.  Their enchiladas are made with yellow cheese  which is ok for Tex-Mex  but I did not expect it form this restaurant since it doesn t say they are Tex-Mex. I don t mind eating Tex-Mex  but not went I am not expecting it.
Juan In A Million,246,The best breakfast tacos I ve ever had  I was in Austin for the weekend and had these for breakfast both mornings we were here. Went for El taco Grande the first morning and diversified with some of the other breakfast tacos the second day  including the machacado  migos  and chorizo with potato. All were delicious  but I have to say I preferred the variety and flavors of the smaller breakfast tacos in contrast to the grande which potato  egg  bacon  and cheese. The Grande is a fork and knife taco that s about the size of a burrito and largely tastes of cheese  potato and bacon. My favorite were the migos  which had depth from the eggs  which had just the right amount of browning  and the onion. The machacado was a little juicier  probably because there are no chips like in he migos to soak up the extra moisture  with tomatoes and savory strings of beef throughout.  This place is a huge contrast to the other restaurant we went to for dinner  the Odd duck. One is old and the other is new. One features food that is trustworthy and classic  while the other capriciously plays with what is trendy and seasonal. One you can show up to in the clothes you rolled out of bed with  while the other requires you to make yourself presentable to others in the restaurant.  I ll say this in my review of the Odd duck as well  but for me  Juan in a million is the kind of restaurant I prefer. The waitresses remembered us from the day before and were super friendly  the food tasted like a warm hug  and overall  I just felt cared for. This is a restaurant that understands what it means to feed its customers rather than simply put on a show of culinary prowess. The odd duck in contrast comes across as trendy  pretentious  and indulgent.  I ll take substance over style  any day. A well deserved 5 stars.
Juan In A Million,247,Definitely get the Migas if you want cheesy goodness. I think Torchy s is a little better in terms of flavor  but when it comes to eating the Migas  they re pretty comparable.   The Carne Guisada doesn t come with much else besides gravy and meat. It s kind of boring.   Don Juan was pretty huge so be prepared  I think it could fill 3 people s stomachs  It s very potatoey so it s kind of up to you what you want. I prefer a lot of cheese so I d go with the Migas.
Juan In A Million,248,Hello Austin   I have been coming to Just In a million for what seems my whole life. Back in the days I use to come as a kid with my parents and share a Don Juan taco with my mother. Now we try to go every opportunity we can since I live in San Antonio now.  We always get a Don Juan taco and a Sweet Tea. With extra tortillas. Always friendly staff  always accommodating. Nothing bad to say.. A true Austin gem.
Juan In A Million,249,They could spit in my food and I ll still give them 5 stars. The owner gives the crispest handshake in the nation and treats you like royalty. The food could have very well been terrible but it didn t matter if it was because the service is so good. To correct the last statement  the food was amazing and I haven t been this excited about anything since I found out IPhones don t get viruses.
Juan In A Million,250,Just get one taco  Holy Hell you get a ton of food  very fast and very friendly service. This place would easily be 5 stars if they had homemade tortillas. Menudo was really good as well  if you are in Austin it s definitely worth it 
Juan In A Million,251,Visiting Austin and was told that Juan in a Million is a must   The portions here are huge. They even have a eating contest for the most Don Juan  the signature taco dish.  I was full from eating half of one Don Juan.  The chips and salsa were really good  watch out for the spice   This place is great for families  breakfast  lunch  and dinner.  Friendly atmosphere.  It s an Austin staple 
Juan In A Million,252,You know we had to try this place if it was featured on Man vs. Food  This was our second time having brunch here while in Austin and it was just as good as the first   Parking isn t that great  but the food makes the circle around worth it  Do what we did and drop the passenger off in the front to put your names down so by the time one of you finds a spot  the table will be ready    there may be a line when you get there  but their fast service makes the line go by so quick. We had a party of 7 the second time around and it only took us 20 minutes to get seated.  His - the Don Juan which is the dish featured on Man vs. Food and the challenge was to eat 8 Don Juan  tacos   I put quotes around tacos because you can get at least 3 decent sized breakfast tacos from one Don Juan plate and could essentially make 2 chipotle sized burritos  Not only is this plate massive and flavorful but it s crazy cheap  Adding the spicy salsa that they serve with the chips creates the perfect flavor profile for this meal.  Hers - the Con Queso Breakfast with 2 over-medium eggs. Not your typical Tex Mex breakfast and and definitely not as massive as the Don Juan but still met my breakfast needs  Queso just makes every food taste great  The carne guisada was very tender and had the same consistency as a pot roast. The breakfast potatoes were great. If you can get the potatoes  carne guisada  egg  and queso all on your fork  you ll have the perfect bite   If you re looking for an inexpensive place in Austin to have a tasty home cooked Tex Mex breakfast  this is the spot  You won t regret it 
Juan In A Million,253,Excellent food  Came from California to try this place out and it was so worth it.  The food tasted like my moms home cooked meals.  The service was excellent as well.
Juan In A Million,254,Tortillas are definitely not made daily. They taste like the ones at taco cabana. Food was horrible. Huevos rancheros sauce was like store bought picante sauce. No  just no 
Juan In A Million,255,This is my second time visiting here. First time was 5 years ago. I remember the portions being huge and they didn t disappoint. For three people we should have ordered 2 meals  maybe even only 1   Our eggs  bacon  cheese  potato mixture came out a little cold but the tortillas were super hot. It would have been nice if the food was a little warmer but at less than  6 for a mountain of food  who can really complain. Chips and salsa are served at all times  even in the morning.   Get here before 10am if you don t want to wait for a table.  Juan in a million is a great place for a cheap breakfast  or brunch  they do serve alcohol .
Juan In A Million,256,What s not to love about a place with a pun-ny name   My friend and I stumbled across Juan in a Million Restaurant while staying at an AirBnB nearby in East Austin. We were looking for a good spot to grab breakfast before hitting the road. With so many reviews  we had to give it a try.   There was a steady flow of customers but plenty of seating  so we were seated right away. The service is fast and the food comes out quick and piping hot. I ordered the chorizo con Huevos and my friend got the Huevos Rancheros. We both absolutely loved our dishes. The portions are huge and the prices are cheap. I also ordered a glass of Horchata - sweet  delicious  and refreshing. It was literally the largest glass of Horchata I had ever seen in my entire life.   Their breakfast tacos looked amazing as well - we simply just didn t have room for more food.
Juan In A Million,257,I don t know who Juan is  but I know he can make one hell of a breakfast burrito. Work brought these in and I was a bit suspect. Boy was I wrong  these are some of the best burritos I have had.   Cheers 
Juan In A Million,258,This cute little hidden gem  The wait was about 20 minutes but so worth it. Socially distanced with covid.  Tacos are huge  Salsa is hot  Coffee was delicious. Definitely recommend 
Juan In A Million,259,First of all  I love the name of this place. Their food is actually pretty damn good. My wife and I shared a Don Juan El Taco Grande which is a  secret combination of potato  egg  bacon and cheese in a deliciously hot tortilla. We also got a small Menudo. The Don Juan El Taco Grande would ve been enough for both of us. It was so hearty and filling its the perfect hangover and sober food. The Menudo was great as well. If I am ever back in Austin  this will be my first stop for sure.
Juan In A Million,260,We were on the hunt for the best migas in Austin  we decided to try Jaun s. We were seated immediately  our server greeted as soon as we sat down. We ordered the migas and burritos and washed them down with lots of mimosas  Delicious    And the owner was there handing out hugs as you paid  so sweet  Don t let the neighborhood or the bars on the windows detour you from stopping in the delish little dive.
Juan In A Million,261,I ve heard of Juan in a Million from a friend  being kinda new to Austin  I know I had to try this place  So on a very gloomy Saturday morning  my friend and I made our way to Juan in a Million. My friend ordered a refried bean and egg taco  while I ordered the Don Juan Grande. First  their refried bean was great  It was the right kind of mushy and it went perfectly with their egg and cheese. The tortilla was fresh and hand made   The Don Juan Grande was enough food for two people I recommend getting more tortilla to share with someone else. The meal also came with chips and salsa. The chips we had were kinda stale but the salsa was great  spicest salsa I have ever had 
Juan In A Million,262,Honestly not worth an hour wait. I was disappointed to see the breakfast tacos on flour tortillas. Flavors of everything were OK... but nothing special. I can make these breakfast tacos at home..
Juan In A Million,263,Man this place is busy. We decided to try because who doesn t love a good breakfast taco  Especially one that is so highly rated. I will say although they were busy the service never lagged. I was able to try a couple of breakfast tacos and all were good. They weren t the best i ever jad in my life but they were good. I really enjoyed the manager coming around asking us about our visit. I would say try this place. Don t let the lines scare ya its worth a shot...
Juan In A Million,264,Fabulous food fast and more importantly very friendly great service. I can t believe I waited so long to try them
Juan In A Million,265,Juan in a Million is such a great place for a filling and tasty breakfast.  The place is always busy and there is always someone to greet you.  Quick service and great food.  I ve always gotten the Don Juan and never disappointed.   Be ready for a food coma after that plate.
Juan In A Million,266,Solid family run Mexican joint near East Sixth. Large venue that is perfect for breakfast or lunch  breakfast tacos  enchiladas  etc . We came here twice on our recent trip to Austin and enjoyed it. Chips  amp  spicy salsa for the table. The chicken enchiladas were delicious  as was the combo breakfast taco that has bacon  egg  and cheese. Reasonably priced. Will definitely return 
Juan In A Million,267,Heard to try this place out as a true Austin landmark.  Got to the location and was able to find a parking spot in the back.  There are limited number of spots that they share with another shopping center  but there are spots on the street too.  Looked like there was a long line  but hostess said less than 7 minutes.  Within 5 minutes we were seated in a room with a wide range of people.  Even though it was crowded  it didn t feel that way.  Food - My wife got the Don Juan- El Taco Grande and I got the CON QUESO BREAKFAST.  The breakfast plate was a good combination and the wife enjoyed the queso with their flavorful chips  but I enjoyed the chips with their spicy salsa that burns after 4-5 chips in and stays with you while you wait for your food.  Highly recommend the salsa for the Don Juan because it does not have much flavor.  They should have an option to add a meat to this dish  but for less than  6 and their homemade salsa  it is enough to feed 2 people with the extra tortillas.  Service - Spot on waitress that filled our waters  which is good due to the spicy salsa.  Feels like a tight space  but not bad inside.  Cashier and hostess both were nice and courteous.    Overall - Highly recommended place to get some good East Austin Mexican food to soak up a night on 6th Street.
Juan In A Million,268,During my short trip in Austin this was on my list  amp  we saved for the last day man it did not disappoint  Staff was great even during a busy lunch hour the owner greeted me so friendly  amp  the food is amazing  my party of four ordered different plates  amp  all were good  Chips  amp  salsa were delicious  The only thing I regret was not going sooner during my trip so I can eat another meal here 
Juan In A Million,269,I ordered the Don Juan at the suggestion of my cousin who said it was enough food for us to split.  Well  I didn t believe her so I ordered my own plate and good gawd  this is a LOT of FOOD    It come s with two tortillas but it s so much food that you may have to request extra tortillas if you want to eat it  taco style .  The food tasted OK  but I was very surprised at the temperature of the food only being luke warm.  We arrived well after the brunch crowd had cleared out and had no wait getting a table so I was surprised that the food didn t come out piping hot seeing how they weren t busy  but what that tells me is that it was not cooked to order  they just had it sitting around in mass quantities to put on a plate when ordered.   IF  I were to go back to this place  I would try something different and I would ask ahead if the food is made to order and explain the reason for my question. The chips and hot sauce are OK.
Juan In A Million,270,I was very excited to come here after recognizing it from tv. I decided to make it our first stop right after our early flight  since it seemed to be on the way leaving the airport.  Only about 15 min from airport  if you re wondering  And close to downtown.    At 11 30 on Friday  we were sat immediately. But not before being greeted by the MAN. I had actually totally forgotten about his tradition of greeting everyone at the door  but as soon as I saw his smiling face I remembered. It was everything.   Our server was very quick and polite  like the others I observed. You are not getting overly familiar service  with the staff asking how your day was and if you ve ever been there before. They re getting your drinks  your order  and delivering your food. But they re doing it quickly and with a smile.   The food  I knew they were famous for breakfast tacos and that they served breakfast all day. So I was really surprised that no one around us ordered them  Made me second guess our choice  but I think they were all locals and had already had them.  My guy ordered the famous Don Juan. You ve probably already read the reviews and seen the pictures. It s really that good. I went rogue last min and got the chorizo con huevos plate. Came with potatoes and refried beans and tortillas. Really good  My favorite style  classic  and exactly what I was looking for. The only star I docked is because it didn t come out hot. His Don Juan was amazing. But my surprise fav taco was actually his last min addition of a carne guisado. It was kind of like Mexican stewed beef - super tender and in a bit of gravy. Amazing. Next time I would totally get the breakfast platter that had that as the protein.   Lots of seating inside so wait shouldn t be a problem. Decent amount of parking but would def be an issue during busy times.   Highly recommend 
Juan In A Million,271,I was in Austin for one day and was recommended to check this place out  Maybe it was hyped up to much but the breakfast tacos were just okay and the service was unfortunately lacking. They were packed though  so my experience could have been an outlier.
Juan In A Million,272,This is my second time here and the last time it was crazy packed  the line was wrapped around the building I m not sure if they expanded it but we had no wait this time around.   We came for their breakfast and I ordered huevos with a side of nopales  cactus  and the hubby ordered the Don Juan El Taco Grande. My food was good  a little bland and definitely need some salt. I was fine with that because I like to add my own salt. The hubby s food was so huge  you can order more tortilla and maybe feed 2-3 more people. His was really good.   The service is great  very attentive and always checked on us. The prices are also very reasonable and a lot of people come here so that says a lot about this place.   PS don t forget to ask for salsa verde. It s more mild than the red one they provide for chips.
Juan In A Million,273,Unpretentious  mom-and-pop shop tacos that I would definitely recommend to anyone who s looking for something  austinite . Soft flour tortillas that holds well  with warm savory potatoes and cheese - what more can you ask for from a taco brunch place  There are a lot of variations on the menu - but not all are amazing. They re known for their breakfast plates and their enchiladas  available only after 11 . I appreciate that their prices are constantly reasonable  especially for their portions  one plate feeds two   The only drawback is that it s so noisy and squeezy in there  you enjoy the food more than you can enjoy the company of your peers. One thing to note  lines start getting long once it hits 10am  so if you don t like to wait  definitely be an early bird   Parking is also limited behind their shop 
Juan In A Million,274,We ve come here a handful of times now and it s always so very fulfilling - both the service and the food are great  the portions are huge  and prices are very good.  We usually get the Don Juan - El Taco Grande as well as the Breakfast Special. We also usually end up leaving with leftovers  But yes the food is very tasty and fresh  nothing is stale or greasy or anything. And the service is always friendly  not just from the waiter but often from the owner.   Be aware it gets very busy on weekends  You ll be fine if you arrive by 9 though. Great horchata as well 
Juan In A Million,275,10 10 service and delicious breakfast tacos  Shout out to the ladies at the door who provided spectacular service while taking down names for tables  managing takeout orders  and answering calls. When I visited this past weekend  they weren t allowing indoor seating but instead had covered outdoor seating. I placed a to-go order on a Saturday morning and it was ready in 15 minutes. My top 2 tacos are the sausage  amp  egg and bacon  amp  egg. Migas is also a great option if you want to change it up and don t want anything as salty. Two tacos was enough to fill me up. Always an Austin staple 
Juan In A Million,276,First off this place ruined my plans. I was supposed to try different breakfast taco places in one morning. But I did not realize the Don Juan was so huge. For  6 I was thinking not that much food but it filled my plate.  My only experience with breakfast tacos is taco Bell so I am a newbie to this.  It was very filling  good food  good service  and cheap.  I did not expect a basket of chips but there it was. I did not finish and I was stuffed.
Juan In A Million,277,Juan In A Million is a good restaurant. I ordered the Don Juan which was good. You definitely get your bang for your buck cause the portions are really big. You need to get extra tortillas with this dish because the amount of eggs  bacon  potatoes  and cheese you get is way too much for one tortilla. Extra tortillas are 20 cents each though which surprised me since usually I can get more for free. The taste of the dish was average  but it was what I expected so I was satisfied.   Overall the place was good but nothing special.
Juan In A Million,278,Heard this spot was top notch in regards to both service as well as food  so had to head over first thing Saturday morning to avoid huge lines. Nonetheless  fairly hefty line around the corner to earn a seat at this spot. We left our name for 5 people and were surprisingly seated in about 15 minutes.  Juan was in the house and gave everyone a firm handshake. Love the enthusiasm. To start off we got free chips and salsa for the table  which they filled up for free later on . Solid starter and the salsa had a good kick. For my main course  ordered the Machacado Con Huevo   9  - a scrambled omelet with dried beef mixed in. Interesting combo of flavors  though the beef was tougher than I expected. Potatoes and beans it came with are your regular fare  fine with hot sauce . Also ordered the Horchata   2   nice cinnamon milky flavor that went well with the chips  not the eggs .  Considering the crowds  the service wasn t too slow. I did find the food satusfying but don t think it s worth waiting in line.
Juan In A Million,279,During our trip to Austin I had heard great things about this place so we gave it a try. The breakfast tacos are loaded I got the chorizo  egg and added potatoes it was really good  They provide a green salsa which is spicer then the one given with chips. Service is super fast we were in and out within 30 min to continue are venture through city 
Juan In A Million,280,Juan in a Million is a great spot in the Riverside area - meals are affordable and great quality. I ve tried the beef tacos and chicken enchiladas - both are a great option  particularly the enchiladas    Pros   - Portions are large  - Prices are low - Lunch specials are especially well priced - Food has great flavor - Staff is kind enough to work with you if you need to make modifications to your meal. Margaritas are well priced.   Cons   - The margarita is just okay in my opinion  though the price is very low which is nice.   5.95 for a margarita  I also wish there was a little more consistency in the way drinks are made - the amount of alcohol that s in each drink seems to vary dramatically between margaritas.   10 10 would recommend you try it out   Would only recommend margaritas if you re in need of a drink 
Juan In A Million,281,Don t really have anything good to say about the food  especially not the Don Juan. It tastes like someone mixed stuffing with eggs and piles it on an underwhelming tortilla. The chorizo and egg was much better and is what I would probably order if I for some reason went back.
Juan In A Million,282,This place had great reviews and we were celebrating my moms birthday and all the locals raves this place. Parking is spotty and spaces are tight even for a small car  to be expected  it s Austin. The wait wasn t too bad but the customer service is what drove me to write this review. We told the waitress to onions in the food  guess what she put onions. Minus a star. The gentleman bringing the drinks forgot my soda  canned by the way  he said...  You drink water then...  minus a star. When the food came the carne guisada was decent and the barbacoa was good but the horrible package tortillas was the worst part of the food. When they dropped of my plates I asked her why are they store bought... she said  that s what we have. I said for a place called  Juan in a million  I would think you would keep it authentic. She rolled her eyes and said ohh well and then walked away. Minus a star. The only part I didn t understand is why we had to sit outside when there was plenty of seating inside in the ac. I guess our skin color didn t allow us to be seated inside cause the ac rooms were filled with white people.   Overall the food was decent  service was horrible and ethics were questionable. Wouldn t eat here again for rubber tortillas and rude staff.
Juan In A Million,283,This place was right around the corner from our airbnb so we came by for breakfast before getting started for the day. I m between leaving 3 and 4 stars for this one. The portions are huge and the prices are not  which is awesome  especially as a visitor from LA  The food though is lackluster in my opinion.  I ordered the Don Juan and chicken enchiladas. I was able to make my way through some of the don juan filling and force down one of the enchiladas while it was still warm and saved the rest. The don juan breakfast taco is more than enough if you re looking for a cheap filling meal  but flavor wise  It s nothing special. It s at least 80  potatoes  that might even be a modest assumption   which are cheap by nature  so I feel that it s appropriately priced at just under  7. It tasted pretty good when hot and fresh  but as a leftover  it felt like I was shoving plain potatoes down my throat  and I was a bit drunk where anything would have tasted good. The enchiladas were okay  chile verde sauce  chicken  and cheese  what more could you expect . I appreciated the scoop of sour cream on them. The plate came with plenty of rice and bean filler  so would definitely be super filling as a standalone plate.
Juan In A Million,284,We joined some friends here on a Saturday around 1pm and had a 25 min wait. Not bad  for how many people were standing outside. Once inside  we were welcomed by friendly staff  promptly brought our margaritas  could have been a bit more potent  and chips and salsa. We ordered their queso  which was delicious  and their most popular breakfast item  the Don Juan  and oh my goodness is it a lot of food.. But so delicious  We also had migas  would pass next time  the tortilla chips in it weren t that good and it wasn t traditional migas IMHO  and the chorizo y potato taco  also delicious. The real star was the Don Juan  though. So cheesy  eggy  sausage-y  bacon-y  oh that bacon was so good    fluffy  gooey  and flavorful. Can you tell I liked it  I wasn t sure the tortilla or chips were homemade  but I stand corrected from Juan himself who wrote me a message to inform me they are  Thanks Juan 
Juan In A Million,285,First time in Austin and I was advised I HAD to have breakfast tacos. Breakfast... and tacos  I m there  I ordered the Don Juan with nopalitos and holy moly it was delicious     Staff was extremely attentive and kind  They bring chips that are fresh with a really yummy salsa. The Don Juan had bacon  egg  potato and cheese on a corn tortilla.  I subbed flour  Being from CA I can easily eat 5 tacos so ordering one was a little interesting. IT WAS HUGE  I was only able to eat half. SOOO GOOD. Definitely recommend   Awesome little spot and I will be returning if I come back.
Juan In A Million,286,I got to give it to Juan....he had a secret formula and it worked for him. As you walk in Juan the owner is the first person you see and he will greet you with the biggest handshake and hug you will ever get at a restaurant. Once you are seated there is no secret as you will order the famous Don Juan Taco....  I have eaten so many potato  bacon  egg and cheese tacos but this one is the king of them all. Biting into the Don Juan Taco takes you to another realm of food paradise. Now it is not the best decor but you got to give credit where credit is due as he proudly displays all his awards for recognition from all over the food industry. Like I said earlier he must be doing something right.......
Juan In A Million,287,Was in Austin for a bachelor party. We took scooters down to Juan in a million with our crew and enjoyed a variety of different dishes. Extremely friendly staff and tasty food. We ordered breakfast tacos and all the breakfast plates. The salsa  was spicy  which is not a restaurant s typical first option. Nonetheless it was very tasty. We also enjoyed the queso and guacamole on the side. Would recommend going back a few times to try the different plates.
Juan In A Million,288,The quintessential hungover breakfast taco place  in my opinion . What do I want when I m hungover  One mound of egg  cheese  bacon  and potato please  Juan in a Million delivers this good service time and time again when I come Saturday for brunch.  To be honest  I have yet to try anything else on their menu because all of my friends told me that I would regret not just getting the Don Juan. So I can t speak for the not breakfast tacos part of the menu.  Why is Juan in a Million great  - The quantity of food - Seriously  the quantity of food  - The fillingness of the food  Why is Juan in a Million not so great  - The salsa they provide is not quite good - In my opinion  overly spicy without much salsa flavor. Kinda like sticking your mouth into pepper without the tasty tomato part - The wait time - The service at times is scattered - Parking can be annoying  I think this is a great place if you just want to eat a ton  If you re looking for classic Mexican tacos with better service  there are better places in the taco capital of the South  East Austin.
Juan In A Million,289,This is an austin staple. Pure austin style tacos with an old school atmosphere. The tacos here are so bomb. I had the grande taco  pictured below  and believe me it s ALOT OF FOOD. Basically a whole breakfast plate on a tortilla. Speaking of tortillas - was a bit sad they weren t homemade but overall still an amazing taco. I also snagged the barbacoa taco and it was so juicy. Cooked so well. Very happy I came here and will always be returning 
Juan In A Million,290,Don Juan. El Taco Grande.   How do I describe this meal   The first words that pop into my head are  Massive  Imposing  amp  Delicious    A meal and restaurant that happens to have my namesake has to be good  right   This could ve easily fed my wife and I but I thought I could manage it alone. I was wrong. It s a massive breakfast taco that you ll need at least 2-3 extra tacos to polish off. While we were there in an unassuming restaurant I saw they had a challenge and naturally I wondered if I could do it. Low and behold the challenge was what I had ordered  the record  9  Yeah  won t be breaking that anytime soon. Austin was an amazing experience filled with amazing food and I can t wait to share more plates I had while there.
Juan In A Million,291,This place is packed every time I go  That is always a good sign  The ambiance is nothing special or fancy  but the food is great  and that s all that matters  . I usually get breakfast tacos to-go  bc I am not patient enough deal with the crowd  They have great prices and fast service  This past time I got egg with cactus. It was delicious  They are not skimpy with their egg or cactus  my taco was loaded  Their tortillas are fluffy and buttery  the eggs and cactus were seasoned and salted nicely  and the salsa gave them a nice kick  They are only  2 and worth every penny   Whenever we are in Austin we always stop at Juan In A Million  
Juan In A Million,292,Got the Don Juan taco and my bf got the chicken enchiladas special that comes with iced tea on Mondays   The Don Juan was a bit disappointing  came out cold and kinda one dimensional tasting. Based on the owner s response to another review about it being a little cold  I asked them to heat it up and it tasted a little better.  The chicken enchiladas were pretty yummy. My favorite was the rice that came with it  had a lemony-lime taste to it.   Queso was pretty good - much better than Chipotle  I don t really like the Chipotle queso. Pass on the pico de Gallo though  too much cilantro.  All in all  decent food and good service.
Juan In A Million,293,We had came here on a Thursday at 2pm thinking that it would be pretty dead since it was about to close and it was a weekday. To my pleasant surprise  the place was packed. Right when you sit down you get served a bowl of tortilla chips and some spicy salsa. I had ordered the beef fajitas which was very tasty and came with rice beans and 2 flour and corn tortillas. My partner had ordered the chicken enchiladas. The chicken enchiladas was very hearty but a bit heavy for my taste. The beef fajitas was just perfect for my tastes. The beef was season well and it was fun preparing your own tacos. The best part of this place is that the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Definitely would come back.
Juan In A Million,294,Amazing local flavor that lives up to its epic name.  Plus some of the friendliest faces in town.   We all left with a hug and a handshake from the jovial gent at the door    Breakfast tacos lived up to all expectations - and served all day  hooray   It s no wonder you see them coming out of the kitchen in droves.  We also happened to be there on the enchilada special day - similarly delicious  cheesy goodness.  And the guac.  Oh the guac.   I was tempted to just eat it up with a fork.   It s no wonder people are lined up out front to get this taco goodness.  Juan in a Million is truly one in a million.  We ll be back  without question.
Juan In A Million,295, 4.75  One of my first visit in Austin.  FOOD   I love the serving of free chip and salsa because these fill you up itself and they re free. The salsa is more on the spicy side for those people with sensitive stomach. I have been getting Don Juan tacos which is covered with potato  cheese  meat and idek. This is really good with the salsa they give you and it will fill you up real fast. It s fairly cheap and if you want  you can order more tortilla on side.  SERVICE   I love the service here especially when the owner gives you a firm handshake.  ATMOSPHERE    SURROUNDING   This place keeps the East Austin unique 
Juan In A Million,296,Awesome Tex-Mex Brunch spot   What to get  Don Juan el Taco Grande  5.95. Incredibly filling and large enough to share  I would definitely recommend ordering this with extra tortillas and guac.   The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful when ordering.  It took a little bit of time to get seated and to get our food  but it was more than worth it 
Juan In A Million,297,TLDR  This is a family-owned cute Mexican place that is worth visiting while you are in Austin. Food was good and portions were generous. Juan was there and he does have a firm handshake. Unsure if it s worth coming back to though.  Things I liked  - I tried a couple of their breakfast tacos - they are really tasty and again  the portions are very generous. I was not able to finish all my food - pay attention to how much you order so you don t over do it -  As soon as you enter the restaurant  Juan greeted us with a wonderful firm handshake. I liked that  but I can also see how this may make some people uncomfortable.  - The service is fast and you pay up front when you are done. If you are looking for a quick bite  this place delivers. I think our total time at the restaurant was maybe 30 minutes  Things I did not like  - This place has a really nice family-owned diner theme  but for some reason I felt it was a bit too dingy and dirty. I like the idea of having a casual vibe  but I found that the tables are too cramped and there is way too much decor  sometimes  less is more  - The food was good  but it was not great. I m not sure what s missing from it. Perhaps it s the presentation. Perhaps it s the flavors. I don t really know but it could use some revamping. - The menu can also use some work. I m always apprehensive of menus that seem to long and too wordy. Perhaps simplify the menu and add more pictures and descriptions  - I appreciate the fast-paced nature of the place  but I would caution against making customers feel rushed.   Overall  this is a good place that could use some tweaking  but overall a good place to get a bite
Juan In A Million,298,Good place for chorizo tacos. The salsa could be better though. It s a little more expensive than other places. Customer service was great though.  Shady characters in this area of town.   Just remember  the more dangerous the area the better the tacos     
Juan In A Million,299,You can t go wrong with the Don Juan  amp  horchata. This place is always a must stop for us.
Juan In A Million,300,What a find     the service and food was amazing.  the breakfast tacos were so good. I had the huevos rancheros and they were perfect.  Warning  the salsa with the chips is  muy caliente.   My only comment is that the tortillas were a bit  lardy.   Maybe they were machine made  but not enough to tarnish the overall experience.  Definitely worth the stop.  Update  forgot to add snap of Huevos Rancheros
Juan In A Million,301,Have been going to Juan in a Million for years - there s usually a line  at least when I go and I never  ever leave hungry. I like to order their Don Juan- El Taco Grande and a Chicken Taco with a side of rice and beans. And if you want something different  order their Caldo De Res with extra beef  yum  best dish at any Tex Mex place in Austin    Take a few minutes to check out their decor and pictures on the walls  lots of great Austin history in this place  48  years of feeding Austinites and lucky visitors  not very many restaurants here have been here that long  so kudos to this place. Getting hungry right now  maybe breakfast or lunch tomorrow...hmmm 
Juan In A Million,302,Wow  what amazing food  We came here for breakfast and though there was a ton of people waiting and the situation was pretty chaotic  the staff was awesome and the wait wasn t long at all. We tried the horchata  so good  And the chorizo con huevos and queso breakfast. We loved the food and will definitely be back 
Juan In A Million,303,Everything is bigger in Austin  They re drinks are bigger  The water and horchata came in super large cups. I think they re 32 oz  I couldn t finish them.   I ordered the Con Queso Breakfast and my husband ordered the Don Juan El Taco Grande  The staff is great  It just feels like you re at their home serving you breakfast tacos  The dishes are extra large in size    I had to take mine to go because I couldn t finish it  I recommend  Come and eat and enjoy  We didn t wait to long to get a seat 
Juan In A Million,304,We love Juan in a Million. If we are in Austin  we go. If we are passing through Austin   we go. I pick and try everyone s stuff at the table and have never had anything bad from there. But I get the Don Juan. Every time. Best thing ever. And the chips and salsa at breakfast time  Spicy  And drool worthy. Some of the best salsa I ve ever had.   We ll be coming through Austin at breakfast time in a couple weeks. Guess where we ll be stopping  For some Juan in a Million  I look forward to it as much as my trips 
Juan In A Million,305,Trust me  you want to go here just to meet Juan  Juan can turn around your darkest day and put a smile on your face. Where else can you go where the owner personally greets you at the door and gives you all of his incredible energy.  Food wise  my plate was a little bit bland  but it s affordable and JUAN    Get there now and see Juan 
Juan In A Million,306,There s very little I can write about Juan in a Million that hasn t been written already. So I m keeping this one quick and dirty.  Juan was there giving high-fives  handshakes  and bro hugs to everyone that walked in or out of the door and I thought that was an amazing and fun touch.  Service is very fast. And the food is very good. But be ready for a wait   It s CHEAP. The  6 Don Juan El Taco Grande is giant. Get 2-3 extra tortillas. That ll be enough. But...you re gonna want more. The ladyfriend and I each ordered a Don Juan plus a chorizo and potato and my god we couldn t finish everything. Oh also there s chips and salsa with everything.  These are quick and dirty burritos that just...don t taste quick and dirty. They re delicious  they re inexpensive  and Juan in a Million is a wonderful experience and it s absolutely delicious.   Just remember  there s gonna be a wait  and your eyes WILL be better than your stomach. Go  go now.
Juan In A Million,307,The wait was minimal and the food is tasty.  We got there about 11 00 on a Sunday and people were waiting around.  After checking in we got our table within 15 minutes.  Ordered and food arrived within 10 minutes.  The Don Juan is a lot of food but worth it.  I got extra tortillas and shared some of the goodness with my wife.  If you have time get some of the queso. It s thin but very flavorful and adds even more flavor to the tacos.    Couple things to know.  If you want quiet  this is not the ideal place.  If you want a secluded corner to have that conversation  probably not the place.  Many of the tables are seated family style and you will be sitting very close to your neighbor.  Too bad you can t get everyone to share.  Don said hello to us and made sure we were taken care of and the wait staff was extremely friendly and on their game.  Another good one for a meal in Austin
Juan In A Million,308,Disclaimer  When they say everything is bigger in Texas  they are right...soooo much food.  This place was a 12 minute walk from my air B amp B and was one of the places my SO wanted to try. We are the Bay Area  but he REALLY wanted to try tex-mex. The breakfast plate sounded tasty  but as we were on a trip the portion was HUGE. We opted for some tacos  beans  rice and soup. The soup was perfect morning breakfast and the chorizo with potato taco was delicious. The egg and bacon  and egg and sausage  was a little underwhelming  as the egg was over cooked. The side of bean and rice were tasty as the beans had lard in them and the rice was cooked properly.  Overall  next time the soup and one taco should be enough as they might as well be little burritos.
Juan In A Million,309,Huge horchatas. The menudo had too much hominy  which i wasn t a fan of... the chips and salsa  delicious 
Juan In A Million,310,This restaurant was very disappointing for a multitude of reasons. First  we waited a half hour for a table even though the restaurant had 10 open tables. Then I got a hot mug of water down coffee  with the complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was actually the highlight  as the ensemble of tacos and huevos rancheros was bland and soggy. What made it worse was the lack of service  as the wait staff was inattentive and standoffish. Definitely not worth the hype unless you re into feeling disappointed and slightly bloated.
Juan In A Million,311,Great food - not so great service.  Ordered the queso  guacamole  chicken enchiladas  cheese enchiladas  and beef fajitas.  Loved the queso dip  The guacamole tased fresh AF.  The chicken enchiladas were good  but not great. The chicken on the inside of the enchilada was a little dry - maybe a little more sauce would have helped push this over the edge.  The cheese enchiladas were delicious. Highly recommend.  The beef fajitas were so so tasty. The meat was just falling apart and was quite flavorful. I really enjoyed the rice on the side and the beans. My husband preferred the refried  but I liked the regular beans.  The food was so good and was quite quick  once we ordered  but the service was really substandard. We were put in a back corner - so maybe it was out of sight out of mind - but it took so long for us to be greeted. Then a long time for our order to be taken. Then we had to repeatedly request drinks etc.. It took a long time to get the check and even longer to get our card back after paying. With all of that said  the food was worth it and I would def return.  3.5 rounded up to 4
Juan In A Million,312,I really hate giving a bad review. Specially to an establishment that seems to have a pretty cool Owner.  But to my despair I was shocked that the flour tortillas where not homemade. I say this from experience from going to other restaurants and seeing the tortillas being hand made.  I was not a fan of the tortillas.  I ordered three different sets of tacos. The portion is nice  however the Potatos w Chorizo was extremely salty. I also ordered a Barbacoa  and added bacon and beans. The bacon was extremely salty too  I was very saddened. Perhaps they might have added a little too much salt that day.  But to end this on a good note  the taco that I did not have a problem with was the Carne Guisada  Beef Stew Cubes . Now that one was perfect  despite the tortilla of course lol. But that s my review. If anyone does order the potato with chorizo or bacon  make sure to let the waiter or waitress know. I let our waitress know about the taste of the tacos after my fiancee and I were done. I simply made a comment  more like a  heads up . Hoping that I could prevent any other customer from having the same incident  but she responded with  you can go ahead and tell the cook yourself. I was shocked lol.  I mean I told her to tell the cook because in the end she works for the guy lol. So I thought it would be best coming from an employee. But oh well. Also  I was going to buy a mimosa  but my goodness   6     no way jose lol  The reason I say for the customer to tell the waitress or waiter  is because she said you should of let me know ahead of time. But I m always afraid that my food will have spit on it from an upset waiter waitress who ve had enough dealing with customers. I ve had waitresses and waiters give me an eye roll or snatch the plate from my hands. Sorry for being a little precarious.
Juan In A Million,313,Food was great not too much spice. Prices were reasonable and service was excellent. Going back to try lunch or dinner. This was my first visit.
Juan In A Million,314,Was worried the wait would be extensive but timed it just right as a crowd began forming outside as we left. Was still feeling the night out before  my appetite was at an all time high. This forced me to order two main dishes to manage this hunger. The service was rather hands off and it did take awhile to get the food  but boy was it worth the wait. The Don Juan Taco is a must try. Very hearty and filling with a great amount of flavor. The con queso breakfast was good but was ordered for my 2nd stomach which I didn t have that day. The atmosphere was unique  one worth taking a picture in. Best part of our visit was giving Juan himself a big handshake and hug on the way out 
Juan In A Million,315,A long time favorite of Austinites and those who are visiting. Always busy  always fast service  and the owner is always there with a smile and a handshake. The Don Juan is a must  just be sure to bring your appetite and well priced . If less hungry  try any of their other breakfast items. If you love the busy  unpretentious Austin s East side  this place is a must for a breakfast stop.
Juan In A Million,316,It was pretty packed for a Thursday morning. We ordered the Don Juan taco   enough to make 4 tacos  huge and yummy. Menudo... The tripe was very soft but I thought it didn t have enough taste. The Don Juan queso was so so. If I come back I will probably just order the taco. Service was good. They have a parking lot in the back.
Juan In A Million,317,It was fantastic place too eat   We got in pretty easily  very busy place  Very worth too eat there. The prices are great   The service was nice   I love the environment   Can t wait to go back again when I get a chance 
Juan In A Million,318,I m sad to write this review. There was so much hype about this place. I left the restaurant disappointed and unimpressed.  Sunday morning I called the resistant around 8 30 to see if we can get an RSVP. The friendly employee told me that they don t take RVSP  it s a first come  first serve basis. Which is fine. She graciously advised me to come soon because the place was filling up fast. Wow  I thought  that s early. We got to the restaurant within 10 minutes or so. No lines yet  but the place was pretty much packed already. We were seated near the register. It was a busy location. Great for people watching  but not much elbow room. The staff were really nice and greeted everyone with a smile. There was certainly a lot of stress in the air. It was a good stress  business is good. The employees were on the go  left and right.  The menu isn t anything different  it was pretty much an authentic spot. We ordered a breakfast chorizo. I thought it was rolled into a burrito already but it was just open face egg chorizo with 2 tortillas and country potatoes. It was lacking flavor. I was expecting flavor  if not amazing  at least some flavor. Needless to say  my first visit to his highly acclaimed restaurant was a disappointment.
Juan In A Million,319,Was told this place had good migas so couldn t wait to try it out.  I found the migas to be ok  not great.  Just didn t have the range of flavor I enjoy so much.   I do have to admit my expectations are high.   I always do favors for my sister in law so she will fix me migas  -    I hesitated to state this as it could be construed all wrong.  So  good not great.
Juan In A Million,320,You know when you go to a restaurant during your travels and have such an awesome experience to return years later and not  Fortunately  this is not the case. I haven t been back in Austin for six years  so when I came back our here I insisted we go to Juan in a Million for Migas. As delicious as they were all those years ago  they still are. Hospitality is excellent too 
Juan In A Million,321,Amazing Joint   migas  cerveza  amp  chorizo.... what more can you ask for at 9 30 am  This is A Must Try
Juan In A Million,322,I happened to be next to Juan in a Million after my audition. I checked and found an old expired Groupon that I had never used.  This place has the hottest hot sauce that I have had in a long while. My mouth was on fire but I just could not stop eating it. I ordered a chicken and a beef fajita ala carte. They were huge stuffed with meat  cheese  lettuce and tomato. A steal for  6.50 total. I proceeded to get stuffed on those tacos.  Great staff  Good food  Cold AC 
Juan In A Million,323,I was in Austin for business and after our meeting my bosses wanted to stop and get lunch before we headed to the airport.  They ate here the night before and raved about it and wanted to come back.  I love Mexican food so who was I to say no.  The name itself gets your curiosity going.  When we drive up the parking lot is packed.  That was a good sign.  The place was a little run downed  but for me that s where you find the best food.  So I m all in on this place.  I ordered the chicken flautas.  It came with sour cream  guac and rice and beans.  To me  this place was just okay.  The flautas were taquito size and the chicken was good but didn t have great flavor.  The chips and salsa were just okay.  Chips were NOT homemade.  The salsa was pretty good.    Overall  having such great Mexican food places here I ve definitely had better.  Like other Yelpers have said  they ve seen this place on TV shows and I came in with higher expectations.  Austin is a great city with great food choices.  This place wasn t bad.  It just wasn t one of the better places I ve eaten Mexican food.  I don t think I d go back since there are so many places to try.
Juan In A Million,324,Juan s is just classic. Big nice burritos and tacos. Beans and rice. Good salsa and chips and drinks so big you could swim in the cup     Nice staff and quick service
Juan In A Million,325,To be honest with you  I am writing this review because of my endless love for the Don Juan  and the many number of times it has satisfied my stomach  put me in a good food coma  and nap almost the whole afternoon away. Praise God for this wonderful place in Austin  TX   What else can I say  The Don Juan with extra tortillas and chorizo is always my go-to  While there are many other authentic mexican dishes there  the Don Juan never breaks your wallet  and it s wonderful mixture of ingredients makes me come back here time and time again   The wait can get long  but everybody knows about this place  so be prepared ahead of time to have everyone there and present so you can be seated.  My friends and family love Mexican food  so if it s not tacos  it s Juan in a Million  mic drop  Thanks for reading 
Juan In A Million,326,We were in town  amp  wanted breakfast tacos to satisfy our craving. Being from the RGV we knew nothing would compare to our tacos but decided to try something new. This place was delicious  amp  literally had our mouth watering for more  even on a full stomach. Totes recommend Juan in a Million. We had the Don Juan Taco that I swear fed two. Definitely will be our go to each  amp  every time we re in town visiting.
Juan In A Million,327,I always get the Don Juan to share between two people. You can get as many tortillas as you want with it    There has always been a wait when I go during peak times  but it moves quickly.
Juan In A Million,328,I don t get it.... just was not good as advertised.  They put so much cheese on everything.. it s like what is the point. We ordered a bunch of things and from the reviews below I expected much better..
Juan In A Million,329,I love Mexican food but i don t know of any Mexican restaurants where I am from in Florida that has Mexican breakfast food. I love Texas and love that there are so many places that serve Tex-Mex all the time including breakfast.  I knew i had to pick a place to get my Mexican breakfast fix and a bunch of people have recommended Juan In A Million.  We sat down and the first thing they serve us is chips and salsa and its literally 10 in the morning.   I had to start with my coffee just to wake up but then I moved up to a bloody Mary and they sure know how to make a good one.   My friends know that I have BIG EYES. I was super hungry and I just had  to order the Don Juan El Taco Grande. This is HUGE... it has scrambled eggs with potato  bacon and cheese serve on top of a hot  corn tortilla. I also ordered one more corn tortilla on the side. I have to emphasize this dish was huge and I literally could not finish this dish. I was so full and loved every bit that I took. It was so big that my boyfriend couldn t even finish it  even though he finishes everything I leave over usually .  If you are very in Austin and want some good and cheap Mexican breakfast you need to try this place. They are super friendly and the food comes out right away.
Juan In A Million,330,This place was amazing   When you walk in  the owner shakes your hand.  After you are done with your meal  he shakes your hand again  Not only their service was amazing  their food was too. I had two tacos.  They are Texas big and delish   Keep it up 
Juan In A Million,331,When you see a long line  what are your first thoughts   Damn I ain t waiting is this long ass line  OR  I m so hungry and I drove to too many other places that had long ass lines as well. Might as well stay.   Look  the line may be long but sooooo worth it. Line goes really quick. Make sure you put your name on that list  Otherwise you d really be waiting.   Don Juan is where to go. Cheap. HUGE portion. I made the mistake of getting another small taco.   Service is pretty solid. Salsa is spicy.
Juan In A Million,332,This place was a lot more hype than taste. The dishes were basic and easily replicated at home. I found nothing that made then deserving of the long wait and accolades on the wall. The service was great but food was meh. I ll stay home for this type of food.
Juan In A Million,333,These four stars are more for quantity than quality. I ordered one Don Juan  Barbacoa  and Carne Guisado taco  thinking it d be just enough to make me full.   BUT NO  it was not enough. IT WAS WAAAAY MORE than enough  which is a good thing.   And I had to essentially put more than half of my food in a take-out box and reheat it the next morning in a styrofoam box  I know  dangerous waters  using the smallest microwave I ve ever seen  in the smallest RV camper AirBnB could offer.   I can t say anything was delicious  but there were a bajillion carbs  calories  and grams of protein.
Juan In A Million,334,20 minute wait for a table  quick service with drinks chips  long wait for food but it s a busy place. Decent food with big portions.
Juan In A Million,335,BLUF  Super filling  tasty breakfast tacos and Mexican food with extremely welcoming staff    This restaurant is one of my favorite go to s in Austin when I m in town. It s definitely made waves in the social media scene and yea the rumors are true - the owner does meet you personally at the door  one firm handshake at a time  You re seated quickly  but sometimes in the morning you can be in for a little wait. You re given some complimentary chips and salsa  definitely has a little kick to it.   The go to order here is the Don Juan El Taco Grande - a marvelous concoction of eggs  potatoes  bacon  cheese  and tortilla. My girlfriend and I shared this  but let s face it  if you try hard enough you can finish all yourself  And you definitely can t beat the price of only  6-7 for the amount of food you get.   If you re looking for a cheap TexMex breakfast in Austin  this is the place to go for the most bang for your buck  Looking forward to coming back again when I m in town 
Juan In A Million,336,Hands down one of the best place for breakfast tacos in Austin. I usually get the migas and add chorizo to it. The servings are so big that I can usually make two meals from it. The food is fresh  delicious and authentic. The place is usually packed  but it s worth the wait if you re really wanting some authentic Tex-Mex food. The salsa is also good  and they always get my order right. Love this place--I ve been going for years when I visit Austin  and I will continue to do so.
Juan In A Million,337,I was debating whether or not to give Juan in a Million a visit. It looked overrated since being featured on Travel Channel. However  it was that Man v. Food episode that convinced me to come. Well  it convinced my friend to go which in turn convinced me to go.   We arrived before noon and there was a 15 minute wait. The time passed by quickly and we were immediately seated. You get the family-run  tex-mex diner feel. They brought us a fresh batch of chips and salsa. We ordered the Don Juan El Taco Grande  go figure  and a small guac to share and I got a horchata   2 . Most people seem to order another tortilla but we were fine with one.   People are not kidding when they say it s HUGE. No wonder it was featured on Man v. Food. We just ate it like a scramble with the guac  chips  and salsa. The salsa was tasty and provided a nice kick. After we ate enough  we ate it just like it should be eaten - a taco. Essentially it s two meals in one and feeds two hungry people just fine. The horchata was good and also enough for two people. I ended up taking the rest to go and it filled up an entire to-go cup.   Overall  Juan in a Million is a good place for a no-frills  comforting breakfast. The portions and value alone will keep you coming 
Juan In A Million,338,Tried this place before leaving Austin and it was delicious. I passed here the day before and saw a line outside.   I went around 9 am on a Sunday and it was not busy yet  so the service was quick. I ordered the Don Juan el Taco Grande and it was definitely huge. Big enough for 2 people to split. It comes with additional tortillas since it is so huge  My only complaint is that I wish there was more bacon. I added the complimentary salsa  and ordered a side of queso.  My parents ordered the Con Queso breakfast and Chorizo Con Huevo.   If I return  I would definitely order the grande taco again. It was only  5 and definitely worth it. I believe I set my expectations too high as it was just an average breakfast taco but the size and price is what makes this place enticing.
Juan In A Million,339,Highly recommend the breakfast tacos  Kinda a hole in the wall place but we ordered ours to-go. Lots of options  excellent flavor and good size. We each had 2 and were full for several hours. The migas breakfast taco is the one to get  
Juan In A Million,340,Best Guac We have ever had    Incredible service  food was out in no time  The quesadilla was also super crispy and delicious  Will definitely be coming back 
Juan In A Million,341,This was a cool little place  Don Juan El Taco Grande which is basically a crazy big breakfast pancake with cheese  potatoes  and meat  I can see why this is a big staple in Austin  Now the wait  that was unpleasant but my bf really liked this place  I thought it was alright  I would come again but it wouldn t be my first choice.
Juan In A Million,342,Very overrated based on all of the recommendations we were given. Just average breakfast food  though the chorizo was very good.
Juan In A Million,343,This little hole in the wall is not only an Austin classic  but the Juan taco has been my favorite since I was a kid.  I get three solid tacos out of it. I m pretty sure this place has been around since before I was born.    Most will complain about the long lines and terrible parking  but come mid day during the week day.  You d avoid most of that.  The coffee is good and so is the staff.  You will feel rushed if you dine in. Don t come if you plan on solicalizing and hanging around.  If you re looking for fancy  don t come here.  If you re looking for a place to hang with friends  don t come here.  Come here to enjoy a part of Austin  it s history  good staff and good Mexican food.  Come here if you re okay with being in and about in about 30 minutes.  They re good about to-go orders also.  You can cut the long lines then.   BTW  the salsa is a little spicy for my blood.  I d tweak that a little.  I couldn t enjoy it.  Otherwise  I m a fan and enjoy the experience overtime.
Juan In A Million,344,This place may seem like a hole in the wall place for out of towners but locals love this place especially for breakfast.  We love the Machacado and Don Juan Grande.  The tortilla is homemade.  Potatoes  bacon and beef are nicely seasoned to blend with other ingredients.  I think you ll like whatever they have in the menu.  They offer large portions so you will not leave hungry.  They are very efficient with service.  Today  we got there before the mass of people so we had no wait time.  They have a small parking lot for tiny cars.  There is street parking too.  Couple years ago they were ranked the  1 place for breakfast in Austin.  They are in my top 8 places for breakfast in Austin for sure.
Juan In A Million,345,The ambiance here was lovely and the wait time was not long at all even for a big crowd. There were just a few disappointments we had with ordering vegetarian meals. They told us the fajitas no matter what could not be made vegetarian  but they finally figured out something else for us which worked. I had 2 different breakfast tacos which were reasonable  nothing too special. I wasn t a fan of the horchata because it was SO sweet. It just tasted like milk with cinnamon and sugar which was pretty mediocre. Overall an okay restaurant  probably won t go out of my way to come here again.
Juan In A Million,346,Took my mom and sister here before she had to take her plane out of town and had some breakfast  it was yummy  Anything smothered in queso is a winner in my book. This place is also huge  the seating went on forever it seemed like. I brought the little one and I was still able to maneuver the stroller around and park it at the table with no fuss. Service was friendly and efficient and it was very cheap  a real staple in Austin and I can see why it is so popular.
Juan In A Million,347,The portions are so big  but they do give you to-go boxes if you need. and trust me you need it.  insert Spongebob reference here . Their Horchata is really good and contrasts the heaviness of the food you re eating. I do have to admit  their salsa and queso are way too thin. It drips like water. They don t have any hot sauce which sucks cause the food makes your mouth feel very dry. The salsa is not spicy enough for me so a variety of salsas or something would have been nice.
Juan In A Million,348,A must stop if you re in Austin    Great service and staff  Upon entering we were promptly greeted with a smile. We were seated immediately in a cozy part of the restaurant. Very warm home feeling. The smell of food in the air just like moms or grandmothers cooking.  Server was polite and brought us chips and salsa which I was delicious   We ordered some breakfast tacos and some coffees and a hot chocolate milk. Coffees were flavorful and my daughter enjoyed her hot chocolate.  Tacos were exquisitely delicious. After we ate our tacos we ordered another one just to top it off.  All the service and food was excellent. Thanks for a wonderful experience Juan in Million    This was our first time here and won t be our last    Definitely recommended and definitely a Texas Treasure 
Juan In A Million,349,Great service. Wonderfully friendly staff. And the refried beans are made with bacon fat  Delish.
Juan In A Million,350,I really miss this place. Especially  the Don Juan  especially.   I ll be making a trip back to ATX soon and this will be the first breakfast spot that I hit up. 24-Hour Diner  at 6th and N. Lamar will be  2.
Juan In A Million,351,I m not going to lie  my friends and I only came here at first for the name.   The food was amazing  We had 4 girls  and shared the chicken enchiladas  the Don Juan  and the breakfast special  with the queso   and a side of extra tortillas. Everything was so good. I would honestly recommend everything that we tried. The free salsa that they give in the beginning has a really nice kick  and is necessary for the food to balance out all the heaviness of it.   Would definitely come back  
Juan In A Million,352,Good tacos and breakfast plates  Always a go to in austin for breakfast    Well you can eat breakfast tacos anytime of the day really
Juan In A Million,353,Traveled to Austin for 4th of July weekend 2019. I saw Juan in a Million on Man vs Food many years ago and promised to try it if I ever had a chance to. I kept my promise and I wasn t sorry. The breakfast taco was BOMB  So simple  yet so good. One taco is enough  I could not imagine eating more. The best part was it was priced at under  6  I also tried the horchata  so rich and creamy. I read on Yelp that it gets pretty crowded and parking is hard to find so we took an Uber from our hotel and were seated right away. This was definitely one of my favorite meals in Austin.
Juan In A Million,354,Hits the spot. Make sure to get the Don Juan taco  It s a beast      Message for Don Juan...please get some Cholula hot sauce for these breakfast tacos 
Juan In A Million,355,I m glad my friends invited me to Saturday brunch here. The parking made it look like a madhouse  but the wait wasn t that long and we were seated in a good section.  The place is weirdly set up with lots of sections that don t really go together . Our server was very attentive considering the crowd and the size of our party. I ordered the breakfast taco. It was huge  Literally enough to make 6 tacos. Lol  It was pretty tasty. The hardest part was getting out. We had to line up at the cash register to pay on the way out. This is a BAD idea considering the crowd. This just makes a huge juggernaut at the door with people trying to enter and pay. I m not sure when I ll be back since this place is so far into central Austin  but if I m ever on that side I ll stop by.
Juan In A Million,356,Quick  and portion are great  Stick to the breakfast tacos. You can t go wrong with those
Juan In A Million,357,Two words  Don Juan. Wait  three words. Don Juan   horchata   Everything here is authentic and DELICIOUS  FILLING  AND I COULD EAT IT ALL DAY. I actually do eat it all day because there s always enough for at least 2  meals.   I wouldn t call this your traditional  breakfast taco  place  but it s definitely my favorite place to come in Austin for a tex-mex breakfast.   The only reason it s not 5 stars is because the service has been extremely SLOW the last few times I ve been here  within a 3 month span . It s hard to be forgiving of that when they roll out endless Don Juans  bc that s what everyone gets... they also used to give at least 3 tortillas with each order. I guess people never finished their tortillas because they only give out 1 tortilla now. Another small tidbit - a side of guac here is  5.75  which is a bit much for me   Lastly  there s ALWAYS a wait unless you come after 1 30pm  in my experience . Regardless  I m gonna keep coming back for that Don Juan   OH  ALSO.  For some reason I want to comment on the bathroom   bathroom is super clean. Wouldn t really expect it looking at the outside but yep  clean  
Juan In A Million,358,After 4.5 years of living in Austin  I decided this morning I d finally try Juan In A Million. I went around 7 15  no line  and was greeted warmly by the host. I ordered and had my taco in hand in less than 3 minutes. Probably the best breakfast taco I ve had in Austin and I can confidently say I ve been missing out. One taco  if ordered right  will be perfect and fill you up  I would highly recommend this spot.
Juan In A Million,359,Waited 25-30 minutes to get into this place for a late breakfast around 11am.  I was expecting really good Mexican food  but the food I got didn t suit my Baja California style taste buds.   I found it quite bland  and the atmosphere left much to be desired as well.    Not sure how this place gets 4 stars...... maybe  TexMex  taste buds are massively different from those of us who grew up on the border of Tijuana.
Juan In A Million,360,The Don Juan Taco Grande was delicious    i couldn t finish it because it was so huge. The price is  6.25 and they will charge extra for a couple of tortillas  i think  1 . I will come again when I am in Austin  Wish we have Juan in a Million in Dallas 
Juan In A Million,361,If you re looking for a hearty filling breakfast  look no further because Juan In A Million can definitely provide that for you. The Don Juan is a large taco topped with a mountain of potato  egg  bacon and cheese. It s enough to make about two to three extra tacos if you order extra tortillas. It s your typical breakfast taco  but the sheer size will definitely fill you and it s really great for the price. I had the barbacoa taco with onions and cilantro also . It s your typical barbacoa filled with flavor and juice dripped down from the taco. Overall  it s a great place to get a breakfast fix.
Juan In A Million,362,Ok wow   First time here and this food is authentic and delicious. I had the chicken enchiladas which were phenomenal and husband had some type of tacos. Both of us were super impressed with the fast service and amazingly tasty food. This could easily become my new favorite Mexican restaurant. Yummmmnm
Juan In A Million,363,This place was recommended to us by a friend. We currently live in San Antonio.   This place was amazing  Great service walking in. We were seated immediately.   I ordered the Don Juan taco grande  And my husband got a beef fajita taco and a bacon been and cheese.   We got chips and salsa and queso.   The chips were amazing  light airy crispy  the salsa was the perfect blended salsa with a bit of bite on the back.  The queso would be our only complaint which we can t even really call a complaint about our meal. It tasted amazing but was very thin. I think we felt worse about getting it all over the table then anything.   I did not expect that Don Juan taco to be as large as it was. I got an extra two tortillas on the side and still needed and extra 2-3 to finish the meal. Needless to say we took it to go. It was the perfect blend of well cooked potatoes  crispy bacon  great egg and cheese. Topped the tacos with extra queso and salsa. They were amazing. If my body could ve eaten more I would of finished the plate.   My husbands tacos  The beef fajita- the beef was tender  lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and crisp  also topped with cheese.   His bacon been and cheese Salty  but in the right way. It was the perfect salt level for the amount of bacon that was chunked in the taco. The bacon was extremely crispy just the way it should be when topped with salsa and other ingredients. No one likes floppy soggy bacon....   I would highly recommend this place to anyone in the area or who lives here and hasn t had the pleasure. We will most defiantly be back.   Thank you for opening such an amazing restaurant family owned is the way to go.   Support your locals people.
Juan In A Million,364,This place is fine. It s a classic spot in Austin and has a lot of credit especially since the Man v Food episode forever ago. But honestly  it s subpar Mexican. The food is edible and not gross  but there are just honestly so many other more put together places in town that can offer you an amazing Mexican or tex-mex experience. The food is fairly bland and feels pushed through quickly and without any care. But that s also what you should expect for an older spot that hasn t evolved very much. Paper tickets handwritten out  space feels a little worn with time.
Juan In A Million,365,Huge huge restaurant but you can guarantee there will be a wait weekend mornings. Food is pretty large in portions and reasonably priced. Very much a hot spot for locals and has had a lot of well known people eat here. Food was good  taste homemade and coffee was fresh  Service was a little slow but I think that s due to the weekend crowd.
Juan In A Million,366,Wow   This place is amazing  cheap and super delicious.  I came here for breakfast and ordered the Don Juan El Taco Grande.  The flavors were incredible and saboroso.  It was more food than I could eat and it was served with chips and salsa.  The salsa had a good bite and great flavor.  I washed it down with a bottle of Mexican Coke.  The service was great and the vibe was real low key.  Definitely a place to stop by if you are close to San Antonio.  You won t be disappointed.
Juan In A Million,367,This place never disappoints   Food portions are HUGE and flavorful. I so far have only had their breakfast taco s and each one has been a new favorite. Great customer service very friendly and sweet. I honestly can t wait to go back
Juan In A Million,368,Literally the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had    I got the chorizo scramble with potatoes and beans. So much flavor and it came with tortilla wraps so I could make my own breakfast tacos. My husband got their speciality breakfast tacos that has bacon and eggs. His was really good as well. The server was nice and Juan was standing in the front of the restaurant greeting people. Very friendly establishment with a great menu and delicious food   You have to try this place when in town   
Juan In A Million,369,Authentic from the food to decor to friendly  amp  attentive staff.   Hot  robust coffee - refilled on point. The smell of cinnamon from the horchata filled the air as we sat at our table  so we had to order one. It did not disappoint and the fact that it was practically 32oz of it was a bonus     Free crispy  airy  hot chips and spicy flavorful salsa to start. Normally chips and salsa isn t worth the calories to me  but these met the mark  I got the red menudo  which was fantastic. Tender tripe  not chewy or fatty. Tasty broth and all the fixins. The beans - creamy  amp  super flavorful  you could taste the bacon fat permeating throughout. Stuffed in a warm fresh flour tortilla...mmmm....  Awesome find.
Juan In A Million,370,A must go place for any breakfast taco lover.  I have had the Don juan and know that you will be full for the entire day after eating one.  This trip I played it safe and just ordered the regular chorizo and egg breakfast taco. It was very good and snaking on chips and salsa while you wait is always a plus.    I loved that the owner was there and my friend got see why he has the best handshake 
Juan In A Million,371,Man v Food brought me here. Stopped in while I was in town and was not disappointed. I got the Dur n Juan el Taco Grande and when I tell you it was good  I m not lying  Big portions and it was sooo flavorful. Will definitely be back when in the Austin area.
Juan In A Million,372,I hate to be so critical about Juan In A  Million but I just had so much expectations for it.  I ve never been to a restaurant that was featured on the food network and be so disappointed. To begin with I cannot deal with the fact that the Don Juan is considered a Mexican breakfast taco when the tortilla does not taste homemade. It literally taste like I went to Kroger and bought a pack of mission tortillas.  I am from Houston and can tell you that a great breakfast taco is all about the homemade tortilla. The filling was a bit bland as well.  The taco yes it is huge so please order 2 extra tortillas so that you can manage to eat the filling.  We shared 1 taco and it was enough for both of us.  Do not be fooled by the demand  the long lines all the hype will only leave you disappointed.  This place is great for a beginner to the mexican food scene.  I would not recommend this place to those that truly know what a great breakfast taco taste like.
Juan In A Million,373,We were looking for a great breakfast brunch place and after reading the reviews we knew that Juan In A Million was the place to go.   The atmosphere was great  we did not wait long and were seated right away. The server was very attentive and friendly.  The food is definitely five-star quality  the portions are certainly worth the price  My only problem was that both of their iconic dishes  the Don Juan and con queso are comprised of 80-90  potato filler. If the dishes had less potato and adequate amounts of meat egg  they would have been amazing. The experience was watered down by obnoxious amounts of potato.
Juan In A Million,374,Solid cheap dirty ol  tex-mex. The don juan was a good bet and so was the chorizo scramble. They were both tasty and super filling. The salsa for the table was spicy as hell  just the way I like it. Try it out for a quick breakfast but don t expect to find anything healthy    
Juan In A Million,375,This is my first time visiting this restaurant and it is delicious  cheap. We went on a Monday around 9 30 so there was no wait. There were complimentary chips and salsa. Personally I thought there was a lot of food. I got two tacos  chorizo with potato and chorizo with refried beans both on corn tortillas. The servers were nice and willing to answer all my questions. I would definitely go again.
Juan In A Million,376,The don t Big Juan is a massive breakfast burrito that packs value and flavor. I was impressed with the freshness of the eggs and the mouthfeel of the potatoes.  The major draw if the dish was it s epic size and fillingness.   If you are super hungry and in the mood for a nice tasty and filling meal  but don t need a complex flavor profile  this is an excellent choice.
Juan In A Million,377,Very good Menudo  Flavorful for sure but I was disappointed there wasn t much homey. The flour tortillas were not tasty  they didn t taste homemade. Also I wish they came in a tortilla warmer instead of parchment paper. The tortillas didn t stay warm through out the meal.  The overall experience was great  service and all. I do think the restaurant was a little hyped up compare to what was brought to the table.
Juan In A Million,378,Tried this infamous hotspot for the first time. Came on a Wednesday and it was busy  We didn t wait long for a table. Owner was nice and inviting    Got the Don Juan taco grande  huge portion  and fajita taco also delicious  Chips and salsa for starters and the salsa is spicy  fresh and amazing   Great place to take out of towners   Huge portions for cheap 
Juan In A Million,379,This was one of our must-do stops during our visit in Austin and can I just say WOAH  this place is...Juan in a Million  Everything really is bigger in Texas   See what I did there  Yeah  I m not proud of those either.   The breakfast tacos here are definitely the thing to get. The Don Juan especially is MASSIVE. It s easily the contents of four breakfast tacos on one tortilla. I would absolutely recommend getting extra tortillas on the side. You ll need them. The Don Juan has scrambled eggs  chopped potatoes  bacon  and plenty of cheese inside. Plus  you can get some salsa on the side to add in. I like that you can go the  build your own  taco route here because there s just so much food. And needless to say  it is all delicious.  On top of just how tasty and huge it is  the Don Juan is only  6. That is a steal in any economy  The service is quick here and honestly it s my favorite breakfast taco I ve had in Austin and anywhere ever.
Juan In A Million,380,We ordered    - Don Juan - HUGEEE and delicious  - chicken enchiladas - SOOO good. I was addicted to their side of rice too.   We used the complementary salsa to add a little kick to our Don Juan tacos and it enhanced the flavor.   Fast service here 
Juan In A Million,381,I ve heard such wonderful things about this place and since we were in the area  we decided to give it a try. The parking situation isn t great if you aren t used to going anywhere authentic  in other words  NOT some chain restaurant . There s parking in the back and on the street. We were seated as soon as we walked in. There are still least three separate dining rooms from what I saw  which was way more than it looks from the street   I ordered the Don Juan- El Taco Grande  a secret combination of potato  egg  bacon and cheese in a deliciously hot tortilla  but with sausage instead of bacon. I read a lot of reviews about this place and this was the one thing everyone said to try.  Make sure to ask for at least 3 extra tortillas. This meal became my brunch and then my breakfast the next day because there was SO MUCH  It was amazing and you get so much for what you pay. Also  we had chips and hot sauce  or salsa  depends where you re from  which was very spicy but delicious.  The staff was also very friendly  which is a huge plus.  We will definitely be back but bringing additional friends so they can try this place out. Thanks so much 
Juan In A Million,382,Suuuch a bummer. Maybe I ordered the wrong tacos  but this was overhyped and underwhelming.   Came here after working up an appetite at Austin Bouldering Project  and was amped because of all the tacos I d had in Austin so far were amazing  and people were hyping this place up to be  much  better.  Line moved quickly  and I ended up getting some breakfast tacos  barbacoa  and a chicken  amp  rice taco. Tortillas were okay  the barbacoa taco wasn t that flavorful  and the other tacos were just bland as well.   If I had to come back  I d definitely get the Don Juan  as that s what half of our table ordered and they re regulars. But even then  they did say that it wasn t even  the best   just   the best bang for your buck .  Parking was easy to find even with a bunch of people outside though 
Juan In A Million,383,Best breakfast brunch spot in Austin  hands down  This is a must when in town. My personal favorite is con queso breakfast but they are also known for their breakfast tacos.
Juan In A Million,384,Definitely good bang for your buck here. There are a decent amount of breakfast taco varieties. We got the El Grande taco which was good. There is a large amount of filling so recommend getting the extra tortilla with it. We also got the nachos sans beans and added sour cream and pico de gallo. Again  the portion size was huge- only downside was the mountain of cilantro underneath the sour cream that I wasn t aware of. Not the prettiest place to eat but service was good and food does the job.
Juan In A Million,385,The breakfast burrito is big enough to feed two very hungry adult and we had to ask for 5 extra tortillas and be sure that you do   The complementary chip and salsa were amazing  the chips reminded me of naked Doritos and the salsa were spicy  be careful  it will creeps up 
Juan In A Million,386,Skip the fajita tacos and get the carne guisada. One of the best carne guisada tacos I ve had in Austin. Simple but delicious 
Juan In A Million,387,I heard amazing reviews about this place... I got a breakfast burrito and I just felt like it was okay. The line was crazy so we placed a order to go.
Juan In A Million,388,Best breakfast tacos  Ask for extra tortillas and add guac to your Don Juan. Hidden gem in East Austin.
Juan In A Million,389,Great Service  Average Food  I ve gone here a couple times for Sunday brunch. Parking is always a small challenge  but nothing to fuss about in relation to Austin  downtown parking. The service is great here  Your drinks are never less than half full  and there are always plenty of waiters around to grab anything you might need.  I gave this restaurant an average rating because I don t think the food is extraordinary compared to other Mexican food around Austin. The food leaves you feeling a little queasy because it is smothered in whatever sauce or cheese comes with the dish you ordered. I don t think the food is bad by any means  I just think there are a lot of other options for better Mexican food around Austin and especially on the East Side
Juan In A Million,390,I love this place because it embodies Texas in a restaurant. Awesome tacos. Great price. Portions the size of Texas.  Quick  amazing service and even if there does seem to be a lot of people waiting  it goes super fast because of the size of the sheer restaurant  main area  covered patio area  another small building attached .  Since it s usually busy  you have to flag the servers down to get anything extra you need like water or napkins  but definitely understandable since they have to run between kitchen and tables.   The water cups are giant. I love getting their horchatas  also giant  and the Don Juan is their ultimate giant food popular item on the menu  You can tell them how many tortillas you want  because let me tell you  3 is NOT enough   and there s no additional cost.
Juan In A Million,391,The staff here is so friendly and welcoming that you feel right at home  This is a hearty restaurant and by that I mean  you get more than a bang for your buck  you get a mound of food that will never disappear. The Don Juan taco is a gigantic beast and can definitely be shared between two people. I liked the migas taco more than the Don Juan but no matter what taco you get  you definitely need to buy extra tortillas to catch all the leftover filling. Although you get generous portions  the flavors aren t memorable. With so many amazing taco joints in the city  I won t be coming back to this one anytime soon.
Juan In A Million,392,This spot was pretty good  nothing special. It was very overcrowded so it seems that it s very popular in the area  the staff is wonderful and they are taking COVID seriously but i ve had better overall food.
Juan In A Million,393,Wow. It took me nearly twenty years of living in Austin to come here  but I finally made it   I came with a friend on a Saturday morning. It was crowded but not enough that we weren t seated right away in between two parties. Our server was very tentative given how busy the space was.   The coffee was piping hot  but had lots of flavor once it cooled down. My friend got the massive Don Juan breakfast taco platter and wow... it s HUGE  Definitely worth the price if you wanted to split it between two people or have leftovers.   I had the migas  which were okay. A bit too much cheese and not enough flavor overall  but not bad.   Next time I ll definitely want to try classic breakfast tacos.
Juan In A Million,394,An Austin classic....has to be checked off your go-to list.  El Taco Grande...it is just that...grande  Huge  An enormous amount of tasty food for  6.  Honestly you could easily make 4 to 5 good size breakfast tacos out of just one.  We also tried the migas  very tasty.  Our wait was maybe 2 minutes on a busy Saturday morning around 10am....but by the time we left....lots and lots of folks in line outside.  Service was friendly and quick...did not get a chance to shake the owners hand....another tradition...didn t see him there....lots of pictures with him and famous folks around plus a mash up of mexican   southwestern and was that really two Japanese statues in the back    Bottom line  just go....and be hungry....
Juan In A Million,395,Our party of 5 here arrived here hungover AF on seis de mayo. I m pretty sure my friend threw up in the bathroom twice from all the whisky shots we drank the night before.   We were greeted by a very patient and understanding woman who gave us menus and much needed water. We took a seat at a table outside at around 2pm to a half empty restaurant.   While we were deciding what to order  we each had modelo beers. The server dropped off a bowl of nachos with the best salsa verde I ve ever had in my entire life.   Maybe I m over exaggerating because it was our first meal of the day but I ve had Tex-Mex food all over the world from the most obvious places  Mexico  to the most obscure places  china  and this was THE BEST  THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME  GOAT .   I ordered the breakfast taco and brisket nachos. The breakfast taco was ok and very delicious but the real MVP was the brisket nachos. Regarding portions  the brisket nachos alone could ve been my entire meal.   We ended up with may more food than we could have finished and ended up packing half of it.   The restaurant itself was very clean and very cheap. Bonus points for the witty name.
Juan In A Million,396,Staff was very friendly. Came on a Saturday morning and we waited around 20 minutes before being seated. Food was okay - very filling.
Juan In A Million,397,Juan in a million is a well know hole in the wall that is a staple of Austin cuisine. I have been here several times with my girlfriend and it has never disappointed. Every time I am here I order Horchata. I have ordered bean and cheese and bacon  egg  and cheeses tacos.  The negatives  The tables are a bit crowded in the building that is much larger than it looks on the outside. The entrance gets a bit crowded as people are coming in and out and trying to pay.  The positives  The food is freaking amazing. The portions are very large for the price you pay. The horchata is sweet and cinnamon filled deliciousness. The tacos are fat and filled on Burrito sized tortillas.
Juan In A Million,398,Handshake with Juan  Check   Big plate of Don Juan  Check   Endless chips and salsa  Check   Finally got to check this place off my to-do list  along with some of other great highlights   The Don Juan is so filling and will satisfy your carb and cheese cravings. It s even great as leftovers. Overall  the food is pretty good with huge portions  especially for the price. Can t wait to come back to try the chorizo 
Juan In A Million,399,I was the first one there after arriving at 645am. I wanted to taste the hype of the  Don Juan.  I mean it was like every other breakfast taco I ve ever had. It was just average and wasn t worth the hype. You get a ton of breakfast taco but honestly  you could save yourself a trip. If there isn t a line  grab a taco. If there is  skip this place.
Juan In A Million,400,We are back for another visit at JIAM. This time around we brought our three month old son. He was fussy most the time but the staff and the other patrons didn t seem to mind. The food was great as always along with the atmosphere. The bonus was being able to say hello to Juan. Hadn t seen him in a while but it s always a pleasure seeing him. Anytime we are nearby this is our choice for dining.
Juan In A Million,401,My first full meal in Austin  Texas and everything really  was bigger in Texas    I opted for the egg hash brown scramble with bacon  and it came with a tortilla. You should defInitely request an extra tortilla because the one tortilla cannot possibly support all the food in its own. I felt really bad because I barely made a dent in my meal  but I tried my hardest and got my participation medal. The food was pretty standard and nothing too amazing  but it hit the  spot and was a great hearty meal. There was more than enough food to split between two people if you know what you re getting into beforehand  The service was a little slow  but the restaurant is kind of big and it seemed like there was only server in our room  which was fairly big. The coffee kept coming though  which was nice since the waitress was a little slow. Definitely an Institution in Austin and you should go for breakfast tacos 
Juan In A Million,402,There is a reason why people are willing to wait on such a long line to eat here. It s an Austin staple  and if you go on a weekday you can get a table immediately with an added bonus of the best handshake given to you by the owner of the restaurant.  I ve been here several times now  and my go to is the Don Juan taco with a side of beans and a coffee. The taco isn t really a taco since the serving is so big  There is a tortilla laid flat on a plate with tons of egg on top. Depending on how much you want to eat and how you want to eat it you will either need extra tortillas or a to go box.
Juan In A Million,403,Came here after a red eye flight so i was def a little grumpy  but the food and service was good so that made everything better haha. We got the huevos rancheros  don juan  and machacado con huevos 
Juan In A Million,404,We were in the mood for breakfast taco  s so we decided to give Juan a try. When we arrived their was a line out the door  but were able to be seated quickly. The atmosphere is plain and the restaurant is cut up with one room for inside dinning in the main building then you go outside for more seating and then onto a second building for more indoor seating. The employees were very friendly and accommodating.   Our server recommended we order their Don Juan El Taco Grande for breakfast. So we took her up on that and also ordered a side of beans. She brought us a basket of chips and a side of salsa  the chips were stail and I could not taste any other ingredients in the salsa because it was so damn spicy. So our large legendary taco plate arrive  s with a side of tortillas and for the  5.65 looks well worth it. But at first bite what a big letdown. It was a big pile of potatoes  cheese very little bacon and hardly any egg. Just a bunch of filler with no thriller. Their was no seasoning on that as well as the beans. Not really sure what the hype is here.
Juan In A Million,405,We were looking forward to eating here as it was highly rated. All of us were pretty disappointment with it.  We were a group of 8 and seated outside. It was very warm and somewhat uncomfortable.  I think the restaurant should put some fans or something so it would be a better experience for the guest.    Ordered the Don Juan Taco with a horchata.  Everything is truly bigger in Texas. I love horchata  but I couldn t even finish this. It was probably one of the better horchatas I ve had  but definitely recommend sharing. The Taco was so underwhelming. It wasn t anything special and I don t know why it s such a big deal other than its size. I m quality of quantity for sure.   Overall  we all were disappointment with this place and felt pretty gross after. I should also mention the the service was pretty bad. It took a long time for our food to come out  service was slow  no utensils until minute after our food was served  one of our friend s order had been forgotten  and the cashier was very rude. Would I go back  Eh  I ll pass.
Juan In A Million,406,Such a delicious breakfast spot  and the covid precautions made my group feel comfortable  Will continue to eat at this Austin token many more times 
Juan In A Million,407,Went this restaurant with friends.  It was great experiences.  Food was great and staffs are very friendly.  Will come back next time in Austin.
Juan In A Million,408,- do not bring in outside food or drinks  they will take it from you and hold it hostage at the front of the restaurant  Order the horchata  it was the biggest serving I ve ever had and one of the better horchatas I ve found in the states. The mahacado con huevo is a must  my friend ordered chorizo and it tasted like chorizo  my dish tasted unlike anything I ve ever had before.  Also  the inside is huge. They probably had about 30-40 people waiting outside for brunch on Saturday and we were told it d be a 15-20 minute wait. Amazing.
Juan In A Million,409,Oldie but goodie. They have great breakfast tacos and if you go for lunch  they have some of the best chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Usually has adequate parking.
Juan In A Million,410,The name is extremely catchy  I will give them that  But the food  not so much... we saw the reviews  a few people we know had said to go and try it  and we got pulled in by the fun name...  We went for breakfast and ordered a LOT on the menu to try different items. Everything we ordered had zero flavor and felt like we were eating retried beans out of a can.. maybe it was breakfast and what we got  but it was not good. The presentation is also below par...  The ambiance is not great  the service is not great  the wait time is extremely long for what you are getting  we live in a city with hundreds of food trucks that serve WAY better breakfast tacos   and the food is bland.  I would say if you are thinking about going here because if he clever name  don t.. if you were recommended by someone you know and trust  then go for it. I will go again someday to test it out and see  but it will be a while as there are way to many other great places to try in the city.
Juan In A Million,411,Juan In A Million would have gotten more stars because the migas taco was very good.  Loved it.  But the Don Juan El Grande Taco was not.  The description of the taco was misleading  and honestly kinda funny.  Eggs  They should not be added in the item description since you really could not find any eggs in the taco.   And   ...in a delicious hot tortilla.   You barely could even see the tortilla.  We had no idea that this taco was so gigantic that 3-4 people could eat one.  I don t know but I ve even many  many a taco over my lifetime  and breakfast tacos should be normal size so that maybe you could have a couple of different ones.  And there s no photo to let you know how friggin  huge this pile was.
Juan In A Million,412,The food was decent  atmosphere was okay and service was good. It took a long time for our meals to come but the owner s daughter frequented our table giving us an update on the food. Just odd that tables that came after us got their food well before us.  The salsa tasted weird so they got us new salsa and that was just mediocre.  The tacos were HUGE  definitely shareable. I got the taco salad  it was decent but I ve had better.   We sat outside  if you have an option  choose inside- it felt like we were in a hut in the back as the fans didn t work well. It was so hot by the time our ice waters sat on the table for a few minutes  the ice had melted.
Juan In A Million,413,This is a hole in the wall  gem of a restaurant  in a dive-y part of town that seems like it s going through some gentrification.  Either way  get in and get in early if you want some real  down-home Mexican food.  Our first visit  the place was pretty packed for 940am but we were quickly ushered to a seat while our waitress took our drink order.  Topochico for me and a Mexican coke for my hubby  also regular waters too.  She asked us immediately if we knew what we wanted  which we did not  so she zoomed away to another table.  All of the food flying out of the kitchen was covered with cheese  heaping helpings on a plate and it was pure comfort food.  My hubby got two breakfast tacos  yum  on what appeared to be homemade tortillas.  I felt lucky to be able to get the beef soup  caldo de res  with a side of Mexican rice for breakfast.  It came with two corn tortillas which I did not touch.  The soup was so delicious  the meat was a little tough but I just put that to the side.  I was really after the loads of veggies and broth.  I added in the perfectly cooked and seasoned rice.  I would order the bowl next time   Go ahead  get some  just wear some stretchy pants 
Juan In A Million,414,I have never had Tex-Mex food so I was super excited to try when visiting Austin. Found this place on yelp because of the great review. We came when they open so it was not super crowded. This place is massive and they even have huge patio seating. As for food  I got their famous Don Juan EL Taco Grande. It was amazing  The potato  egg and bacon def make me filling and there is so much flavor in the taco with only  5.95. You can def share one with another person. I also love how they give a free basket of tortilla chips before the meal. People here were also super welcoming and friendly. I would def come back here when I visit Austin 
Juan In A Million,415,Just left this place  we were seated and the drinks were brought. Then the waitress proceeded to ignore us and see to every other table but ours. There were no less than 4 other waitresses standing around doing nothing but watching the happenings on the floor. When we finally got tired of waiting and after we complained we decided to take our business elsewhere and we were still charged for the tea and coffee. This used to be a great customer service based business who if something went wrong it was made right  It s true what they say you go to an east side business  you get east side service 
Juan In A Million,416,I stopped into this place right after a red eye flight from D.C. Needless to say  food was very much needed after a turbulent flight. Juan in a Million is a no-frills restaurant that serves good Mexican style food. They are known for their breakfast  brunch   so I decided to try the Migas  and they were great  The only downside was there was a little bit of a wait because it s not very large  but I didn t mind waiting a little bit. If you re looking for some solid food  check this place out. The portions are satisfying  and the food is good.
Juan In A Million,417,Well  we found our Austin breakfast spot  We visit Austin occasionally and love discovering the local restaurants. I have two hungry teenage boys who couldn t even finish their tacos. They are amazing - better than any we ve had. The chips are awesome too. We will definitely be coming back   
Juan In A Million,418,Just like most  I wanted to visit this place due to it being on Man vs Food.   The place is pretty run down  service was almost non existent  and the food was okay. The one thing I do have to point out is that their chips and salsa were really good. Other than that  the tacos  fajitas  and enchiladas were whatever. None of the food was bad at all  but there wasn t anything that blew me away. There are so many Mexican restaurants to compete with  and you really have to be something special to stick out. Having a spot on a TV show won t save you for long if you choose to half ass what you should be passionate about.  There are dozens of other Mexican food joints located in Austin that do everything better.
Juan In A Million,419,Hmmm.... I was trying to understand what the 5 stars were all about and I think I know. The staff is super friendly  the portions are huge and the food is cheap.  Unfortunately  I was really disappointed by the taste. The tortillas were not grilled   cooked and since they were full of too many ingredients  the taco was breaking while I was eating. It was also difficult to appreciate the different elements within the taco.   Yelpers  it is important that you stop categorizing or calling Tex-mex restaurants Mexican because these are two very different types of food. With all due respect to Mr Juan  indistinctly throwing ingredients in a raw wheat tortilla is not Mexican. Mexican cuisine is elaborate  which is why it is considered intangible world heritage by UNESCO.
Juan In A Million,420,I love this place  You have to try it at least once if you are in Austin  I have tried other things on the menu but pretty much this sells it for me  A combo of bacon  eggs  and cheese  Super delicious and did I mention it s pretty cheap  I believe all you need is  5.95   tax and it will get you this delicacy   It could feed two or 3 depending how hungry you are  It will for sure feed one   You can free chips and salsa as well no matter what hour of the day it is  staff is always friendly quick and welcoming place looks a bit run down but is kept clean. Will keep coming back for years to come
Juan In A Million,421,Bla...the beginning of my review....nd...surely the end. I added salt and the taste just got tiring. So there you have it. The famous Juan in a million is all about size that makes people rate it so high. But for a real connoisseur of Mexican food  this is far from the experience you will want to remember.  The tortillas taste factory made. The Don Juan looks really dry. I didn t taste it but those at my table that did  weren t impressed with the exception of a 15 year old boy who would literally eat anything.  But if you want the experience of going somewhere in Austin that Adam Rich of Man vs Food tried a challenge  then come waste your money here. I m off to salt lick where I m hoping this trail Adam left picks up allot better and tastier.   It was nice to see the owner in person.  Hola and Prosper.
Juan In A Million,422,Best breakfast tacos I ve had in a minute.. hubby and I went earlier this week and loved their chorizo and been with cheese tacos
Juan In A Million,423,As good as advertised  For only  5.95  you can t beat it  Good ole home fashioned cooking. The salsa was great  Guacamole was great  Definitely coming back again one day when I m vacationing again 
Juan In A Million,424,We went here last minute because our original breakfast spot didn t work out. So glad we did  Be warned- THESE BREAKFAST TACOS ARE HUGE. I got three thinking that they were going to be normal street tacos. I could barely finish them. They stuffed them full and all three tacos were so flavorful. I wish we lived in Austin so we could come here at least once a week. The service was also great even though they were busy. Our coffee and waters were always full and so were our chips and salsa. Would highly recommend 
Juan In A Million,425,Awesome spot     Visited Austin for the weekend and was looking for a spot to stop for some Mexican food for lunch. Really glad we stopped here   Was greeted by Juan immediately when we walked in as he shook our hand and made us feel like we were regulars. He was the sweetest   Service was great and food was out of this world     Best chicken enchiladas and the refried beans had so much flavor  it tasted like they used smoked beans . Highly recommend and next time we are in town we will be stopping back here for sure   
Juan In A Million,426,They prorated tax per entree and it was confusing. Also more Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican
Juan In A Million,427,Gotta stop here for breakfast every time I m in Austin or passing through. Their menudo is delicious and micheladas on point. Breakfast tacos could use a little more seasoning but I guess everyone has their preference in this area. They always have a wait but I ve never waited longer than 20 mins. Aside from that service is always A .
Juan In A Million,428,I ve lived in East Austin for two years now  and I finally decided to pay Juan in a Million a visit  however  I was disappointed. I got the bean and cheese breakfast taco  but the tortilla did not appear to be house made and the frijoles did not taste good. The salsa wasn t good  just picante. The horchata I ordered tasted like the Klass powder horchata. I won t be coming back or recommending this place to friends.
Juan In A Million,429,My first stop after arriving in Austin. Ordered the Don Juan El Taco Grande and the Con Queso Breakfast. The Con Queso breakfast was delicious. The Don Juan El Taco was dry. Wished I had ordered queso all over that taco. The place was really busy but it s really big with 3 separate seating areas  so we got seated quickly.
Juan In A Million,430,I feel like we may have ordered wrong. We got a few items off the breakfast menu instead of the Don Juan Taco  next time  . I got one of the breakfast plates with eggs and beans and tortillas. The most memorable item was definitely the refried beans - they were smoky with a meaty aftertaste  Everything else was fine.
Juan In A Million,431,This is a hopping  busy place and the proprietor does his best to greet everyone entering and leaving his place.  I think I made a bad choice in just ordering the taco dinner and it was nothing special.  I wish now I had gone for breakfast and tried one of the dishes that gets rave reviews here.  I will try again to give the place another chance.  It wasn t bad  but it didn t make me long to return.
Juan In A Million,432,I came here for the first time while visiting Austin a few days back. I ve heard all of my friends rave about it and so I needed to try this place out   Atmosphere  it s a very homey place - with family sized tables and an outside patio. It can seat 2 people to even a party of 12  which was how big my group of people turned out to be. It was a bit hot outside but the patio was cool and not humid.   Food  Even though we went for breakfast  chips and salsa were served almost immediately. The salsa was SPICY. It s not your usual spicy - it comes later and gradually increases as you consume one after another. I ordered the Don Juan  their breakfast special that consists of eggs  bacon and potatoes along with a few extra tortillas. When I say this  I am not exaggerating - the Don Juan was HUGE    Good thing I decided to share with my friend because I would have not been able to finish it. Even between the two of us  we couldn t finish it. The egg  sausage and potato mixture has a nice balance - it s not too salty and one flavor doesn t overcome the other. At such a low price  you re definitely getting your money s worth. Will be back later if I ever come to Austin again 
Juan In A Million,433,Everything I was expecting Eastside hospitality and excellent food  Fresh  delicious with a smile and great service  Breakfast or lunch  brunch you can t go wrong. Nothing frilly just a good home feeling relax and get your grub on place  All the staff made you feel at home. Will return my sons loved it 
Juan In A Million,434,I understand this is an East Austin staple but the food is not good quality. The eggs tasted like they were cooked in bacon grease  like everything is cooked on the same griddle and not cleaned. The guacamole was pretty flavorless and I needed to add salt and pepper to it. My friends and I felt sick after eating here. It just seemed like not good quality ingredients and it was pretty boring taste wise. The staff was nice though and it was cheap.
Juan In A Million,435,3.5 stars  really. Plenty to like here.   I hear that Juan likes to greet the customers and walks around chatting them up. Ya gotta appreciate that. He must take Mondays off though which is fine  cuz I wouldn t trade that for a weekend-style wait time.   The atmosphere here is nice  I enjoyed eating in the screened porch area  and the service is very friendly.  My main beef is that here s nothing special about the food  bottled o.j. from concentrate  non-dairy creamer  machine diced potatoes  diner quality coffee...  That s reflected in a slightly lower price point however  so you do pay for what you get.
Juan In A Million,436,This place was recommended as a cheap eat in Austin.  It was absolutely amazing   Beware....the Don Juan can feed 2-3 people 
Juan In A Million,437,Juan In A Million is an Austin classic and it s been featured on Man vs. Food on the Travel Channel. You cannot come here without ordering the Don Juan el taco grande   It is a HUGE breakfast taco that is a combo of potato  egg  bacon and cheese. It comes with one tortilla but you can ask for extra to make some more tacos. The Don Juan is only  5 and some change and will make you at least 3 normal sized tacos  Also the salsa here is really good and actually spicy. Come here for cheap  amp  delicious food  big portions  and always friendly service 
Juan In A Million,438,Whether you live in Austin or just visiting  if you ve never been to Juan In A Million  you need to do so  I recommend the Juan In a Million which is such a huge portion. It s a great place to start your day    I will say if you go during prime breakfast brunch times  then you will have to wait. There isn t enough seating for the amount of people that come to this restaurant at one time so it will be a bit cramped. Parking may be hard too but they have a parking lot behind the restaurant and there is street parking  but those are obviously first come  first serve.   This place is popular and it s a great price for the portion. I do hope they can expand their restaurant but other than that I do appreciate the authenticity of the place. Even though they ve become super popular  they still keep it very simple.
Juan In A Million,439,When you re in Austin for work and have just enough time for a quick meal on the way to the airport  Juan s is a perfect stop. Juan met us at the door with a warm smile  radiating warmth and welcome on an otherwise dreary rainy cold Austin Monday. He asked us whether we were coming or going  we weren t the only diners with suitcases . Going  we replied - back to California - he shook our hands and ushered us into the cozy restaurant. He then handed us off to a server who led us through a covered outdoor area with folding tables and chairs and heat lamps. We entered a separate indoor area with a two top and plenty of room adjacent for our two carry on wheeled suitcases.  The decor is basic but cheery - brightly colored walls and  White trim. The menus laminated with both photos and full descriptions. We were quickly served corn chips and a spicy red salsa - delicious with a bit of kick. The chips were more substantial than those I ve had elsewhere in Austin  lightly salted and addictive.  I ordered a sweet tea and my colleague a coffee.  I decided on the  CON QUESO BREAKFAST   Two eggs served any style with queso  carne guisada  refried beans  potatoes and two flour tortillas  I had scrambled .  Truth booth - there was a photo of this dish  which I partially selected because of the queso and after I googled what carne guidada was  a traditional Puerto Rican dish of stewed beef   I also ordered a side of guacamole - which was creamy and delicious and quite substantial.  My colleague had the migas with scrambled eggs and no beans  we were told the beans were cooked with bacon  which was a dietary no-go for her .  The food came quickly and was delicious and filling. We both only ate half of our meals. I really wanted to bring my leftovers for the flight but decided against it  Juan s seems best hot and fresh  I ll be dreaming about the fresh corn tortillas .  Juan bid us farewell - and safe travels to California - as we waited in line to pay at the register at the exit.  Overall  we were very happy with our strategic Austin pit stop before heading to the airport.   My friend who used to live in Austin says it was a locals breakfast haven - especially good after a night of drinking. I would go just for the warm welcome   amp  chips amp  guacamole  amp  queso  amp  tortillas .   If you re partial to a locals experience  this is the place to go. Breakfast brunch seems most popular 
Juan In A Million,440,This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Austin    The food is PHENOMENAL and the friendly staff always makes it a wonderful experience.  Don t be turned off by the appearance outside - it s definitely more on the  Hole In The Wall  types of places.   This is one of the spots where all of the celebrities congressman athletes come through whenever they visit Austin.  You ll love it 
Juan In A Million,441,Juan In A Million is basically breakfast taco heaven. The menu is full of mouthwatering breakfast taco options but  this being my first visit to the restaurant  I had to order their legendary Don Juan El Taco Grande. The mound of food was massive. A mixture of fluffy scrambled eggs  crispy bacon  soft potato  and cheddar cheese sat on top of flour tortillas. The combination of food was perfect  flavorful  filling  and inexpensive. Overall  Juan In A Million is a must visit when in Austin.
Juan In A Million,442,The Juan Taco  5 5   This is my advice  Come with a friend  come hungry and grab the Juan taco to share as well as some queso dip. Its that simple  The eggs were so well spiced  I couldnt quite figure it out  The spice blend was something I have never tasted before and the bacon was super crispy. I would definitely come back 
Juan In A Million,443,Came in from Houston and found this little gem. We were here for 4 days and had breakfast there TWICE  The carne guisda is sooooo good   I had the con queso breakfast both times because it was just THAT good. The queso is pretty average but the carne quisada is perfect. We were pleasantly surprised that they provided fresh chips and salsa for our breakfast... the refried beans were another star of the show  very fresh and delicious.  We will be back  
Juan In A Million,444,This is a classic neighborhood Mexican restaurant - the checks are written out versus having an electronic system  but they are on top of their games. There is seating inside as well as out on the patio on picnic tables.  We came as a group of 12. They were able to seat us within minutes and gave us our own private area  which was great. The service was fantastic and our waitress was on top of her game. Drinks came quickly.  We ordered queso and guac for the table - neither are anything to write home about  but still good. The fajitas looked great - you tell them how many you want and they come out already prepared. The quesadillas and burritos come with a boiled chicken  but you can request fajita chicken and I would very much suggest doing that.
Juan In A Million,445,We normally really enjoy this place but we went for breakfast today and sat on tha patio while a bird few around and trying to get out. On customer tried to open the patio door so it could get out and one of the waitresses told her to stop. The waitress also said it s been suck in there since yesterday. Why wouldn t you call pest control. Bird literally hit someone trying to leave. Disgusting.
Juan In A Million,446,The definition of Tex Mex comfort food....heaven on a plate. They have the most delicious queso in existence...and I didn t know eggs could taste that good. I love the Con Queso Breakfast  my wife loves the Don Juan and their menudo. Chips are yummy bright yellow  with super spicy salsa. ....As a vegetarian  I have to make some  allowances  to eat here  since it seems everything is flavored with bacon or lard  but  uhh..  chows down   Juan in a Million gets quite crowded on peak hour  so I recommend coming off-peak if you can or calling in a to-go order.   The service is so-so  and the place itself is pretty humble looking  but the food makes it worth it.
Juan In A Million,447,This was the worst food we had in Austin. if you come to Austin  you ll see right away that it is the land of the fancy food truck and there is crafted gourmet food on every corner. I think this restaurant got buzz on a TV show a while back  and it has a catchy name  but I could barely eat my breakfast taco. It was loaded with too much bacon  who k ew that could be a thing  and cold cheese. I would totally skip it this downer and go to Veracruz instead.
Juan In A Million,448,If you want breakfast tacos that s quick  very filling and delicious  this is the place to come  The owners and staff are really nice and Juan Sr really does have one of the best hand shakes ever  If you re in the Austin area this is a good go to place 
Juan In A Million,449,Diet Coke in a can rather than fountain  Sorry  this matters to me  this is a place that charges for refills and serves you out of a can  not cool.  The food is good  why ruin the experience with cheapness. Ordered Juevos Rancheros. Diced potatoes  over easy eggs  refried beans  two tortillas. We also ordered the Don Juan Taco Grande.  They asked if we wanted extra tortillas with that and we said  no   mistake. Ask for extra tortillas  at least three. It comes with one tortilla that is laid got on the plate and a huge mound of filling covers it  impossible to use that tortilla without first eating three quarters of the filing with a fork. So unless you plan on eating it with a fork  get at least three extra tortillas.  This is not a fancy place. It is homey  straight up food. And it s good.
Juan In A Million,450,It s been 3-4 years since I came here  but it s always busy and good time when we do come. It was a quick 15 minute wait  but always worth it. I got the do Juan taco grande  his famous breakfast taco  and it was so delicious  My plate was so full and they give so much food  it looked like I didn t even touch my plate. You get more than you think and it s reasonably priced at  6.95  A very great deal  I will come back every time I m here  I also met Juan again lol
Juan In A Million,451,Good food  friendly service  shockingly short wait for 10a.m on a Sunday. Party of 3 took less than 5 minutes. Tons of food comes with the meal  all of which was delicious. The Don Juan was delicious 
Juan In A Million,452,It s practically criminal that neither of us had ever been here. What kind of Austinites are we   We changed that on Saturday.  We got to Juan In A Million pretty early  and after some initial confusion about where we were going to be sat  we had such a fun time here. The coffee is regular and strong  and the food is greasy and breakfast-perfect. We initially thought we had it in us to do the Don Juan challenge as a family  but ended up chickening out and getting it as a single portion. It was nice and filling  but we loved the migas we also ordered more and there were plenty of leftovers to bring home. Our daughter enjoyed her scrambled eggs and walking around the place like a little baby boss.  All in all  a great Austin institution that we re happy has survived east side gentrification. We ll be back  and will have to start bringing more of our guests here as well.
Juan In A Million,453,Here we go    1. Get here early.  crowds form around 9 on the weekends   2. Order the Don Juan with 2 extra tortillas 3. And maybe a breakfast beer  4. Eat all of it  or at least try to   5. Be happy and have a nice day. Because you just had one of the best darn breakfasts in Austin for under  5  pending breakfast beer selection  and it was served by people who are kind  attentive  and enjoy what they do.   Short review - one of the best breakfast options  both for quality and price  in Austin hands down. Enjoy 
Juan In A Million,454,For my 500th review  ... this place really is  juan  in a million     COMP - Tortilla  amp  salsa   even at 8am in the morning...  amazing crispy chips though   And that salsa is one hot motherf    r     GET - Breakfast migas   came to Austin. Heard about migas everywhere  a must have   Braised chicken   tortilla strips   cheese  all wrapped in tortillas.  Yums     YES - Fast  friendly service   YES - THREE separate dining areas.  I felt like the waitress put us in the best indoor dining option  clean  well-ventilated  quiet.   YES - Inexpensive and delicious Tex-Mex cuisine    WOA  - Free parking lot out front - Joint looks like a liquor store from the outside   But full-on dining feel once inside 
Juan In A Million,455,The awesome thing about Juan In A Million is that the owner is usually on hand to greet his clients in person. This totally sends me back to the 70s when Matt would greet his clients at the old downtown Matt s El Rancho.  For us  it s just a short walk  which is very nice.   The food is good solid  Tex Mex  but nothing really stands out for me. Good salsa  ok beans.   But somehow the Juan has tapped into the Hipster clientele. The long lines seem to put off our old timey neighbors who often wonder aloud how on earth the place got so popular.   Mostly they don t believe anyone would stand in line for those beans   Another really great thing about Juan s is they host meetings for local Hispanic business association-- which is a great service to the community  It might actually make up for some of the ugly scooters their hipster clients leave strewn about the sidewalks.   Overall  we re glad to see a locally grown business do so well and visit now and then when there are no lines snaking down the sidewalk or scooters to dodge.
Juan In A Million,456,My family and I took a day-trip to Austin for New Years Day 2018. Someone had seen Juan In A Million on TV for their monster taco  or something  that you have to eat in under a certain amount of time to get a T-shirt  or something.    Basically  it seemed like a neat addition to Austin worth checking out if you re in the neighborhood  and that s exactly what we did. At first  we considered just driving by and looking at the outside. But there was a large crowd of people pouring into the door  so we figured it must be good. We parked  in whatever little spots were left  and joined the crowd.  There was a hostess with the magical wait list in her hand standing at the front door. She saw us approach from the street  but she did not greet us  despite making direct eye contact with me. Instead  she shut the door in our faces and went back inside. We went in and decided that if she couldn t give us the time of day  their servers probably wouldn t either. We decided to take our tacos to go.   I saw  Juan  behind the counter. He seemed like a nice enough man but he was obviously busy and didn t notice his hostesses being indifferent towards the guests. My family placed their to go order  and I asked one of the girls where the restroom was. She waved her hand in the general direction of the back room and said  oh  it s that way.  Again  the indifference was painful.   I went to the restroom  but it was in use. They have exactly one bathroom for each gender. There was one hostess  and another female employee standing outside the restroom near this sink and they were both on their phones talking about how they hated how busy it was  and that they just wanted to go home. The hostess took the restroom when it was free  phone in hand. It s ashamed she didn t offer the only free restroom to a customer  but maybe that s my personal opinion.   On another note  while I was waiting for my turn in the restroom  another hostess forced my family to wait outside in the 30  weather for their to go order despite there being plenty of room to wait inside. That s also a little rude.   Anyhow  we left  and I was glad. No one told us goodbye. They just handed us our to go food  said  The salsas are in the bag  and walked off.   The salsas were  in fact  in the bag. The food was pretty good. I had the quesadillas which came with a generous amount of guac and sour cream. The fajita inside the quesadilla  however  was extremely chewy and hard to swallow.   Would I go back  Maybe  probably  nah.
Juan In A Million,457,My love for this place knows no bounds   I will celebrate being their 800th review thus   This has been our go-to morning after Saturday breakfast place for quite some time.   I first learned of this place as a runner for a local law firm  but never experienced the beauty that is the Don Juan until after I moved.  A pilgrimage takes place regularly when I am back in town.  Order this sucker with guac  you ll thank me later  as well as two extra tortillas.  Trust  this one taco is a beast and those extra tortillas will be needed.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is good and spicy.  If you re lucky the owner will be around to share his legendary handshake with you and what else can I say that hasn t already been covered in the other 799 reviews   Sure  the wait can be long thanks to its TV appearances as well as its great food  but trust me  you will not leave disappointed my friends.  Or hungry for that matter.
Juan In A Million,458,First time visit to Juan in a Million  and I m a fan.  I ordered the Don Juan thinking it was going to be some piddly little taco.  It was huge  and covered in cheese.  I had to stop halfway through just to let my food settle.  My only reason for giving 4 stars was because the line wrapped around the building and it took 30 minutes to get seated.  Otherwise a great experience.
Juan In A Million,459,Oh man  so happy to return to this awesome mainstay. It truly is Juan in the million. Very well managed  fresh  lovely guacamole- decent flautas  Even Martha Stewart has been there.  If you visit Austin - check it out to see what old Austin is about.
Juan In A Million,460,Unfortunately I d had high hopes for this place. The food was pretty bland. Not much flavor at all. It was luke warm too  prefacing I did use Uber eats delivery . Price point is reasonable.
Juan In A Million,461,Long wait in the rain but totally worth it. Make sure to ask for extra tortillas for this taco - it easily fit into three other tortillas to make extra tacos  I was stuffed by the time I left  all for under  7.
Juan In A Million,462,I m going to give 3.5 stars. Juan in a Million seems to be on the ever long lists of places to try in Austin. We got there around 9 30 a.m. on a Saturday and there wasn t a wait. The longer we were there  a line had started to form. Service was good and quick. The salsa was good and spicy. The queso was subpar but tasted better by adding their salsa into it. The refried beans were my favorite. The breakfast tacos were good but the tortillas didn t taste like they were homemade. I tried a bite of my friend s Huevos Rancheros and it was good. Bottom line  will I go back  Yes. Will I wait in a long line  No.
Juan In A Million,463,Great service for how busy they were. We arrived at peak hours but people were rotating out so quick couldn t even noticed  wait time was only 10-12 min. Food was great I got the chorizo and egg came with beans and tortillas  and I ordered a side of bacon  very authentic Tex Mex reminded me of my moms cooking. If I wasn t so hungover I would have gotten the signature taco  it s a massive breakfast taco that s pretty much 4 tacos in one. WARNING salsa is HOT  I know first rule of salsa or hot sauce don t believe anyone until you try it  but as a frequent hot sauce eater and Hispanic...it s freakin hot. Our waitress said  pensa que estaban nojadas   I think they were mad  it s Mexican folklore that when a person is mad or upset the salsa they make will be super spicy. Parking is scares and it s in a rough part of town that s being gentrified. I see a lot of that in Austin.
Juan In A Million,464,Place was packed when we came here. Barely any parking but food is soo good. Came out very quick not a long wait at all. Perfect food for a hangover
Juan In A Million,465,This place is definitely lover hyped. Their tacos and burritos are basic. The Don Juan was not even good which is what they re known for. You can find better food elsewhere 
Juan In A Million,466,This is a cool divey place with great food. I love the fact that they ve attached a couple of homes together with a large patio cover to create a groovy one-of-a-kind Austintateous Mexi-CAN restaurant. I suggest the beef and chicken fajitas because they are really tasty and cooked to perfection. Chips and hot sauce  great hot sauce too  abound and the service was spot on.
Juan In A Million,467,Ahh I love this place  Austin wouldn t be the same without it   I always come on Saturday mornings after crew practice. The go-to for value is the Don Juan which is a HEAP of potatoes  eggs  cheese  and bacon  and you can order extra tortillas.   The horchata is the huge and definitely one of the best I ve ever had in my life.  The caldo de res is super yummy and feels like home  super good on a colder day or sick day.  This place is always really busy but all the servers are so nice      
Juan In A Million,468,Food is great and their portions are pretty big and decent. The place is kinda small  but the service was great and they re pretty quick. They do get busy  so be sure to get there early especially if you have a big party.
Juan In A Million,469,Outside looks like a whole in the wall. Nothing wrong with that. I had the don juan taco it was hot and fresh. Definetly order extra tortillas. Which brings me to the tortillas are not homemade but they are hot. It was a little pricey compared to other places. The service was great and very attentive.
Juan In A Million,470,Juan in a Million is one in a million when it comes to experience. You re always greeted by the owner  maybe Juan  and you ll never leave with an empty stomach. People line up down the street to get a chance to taste the food here and it s well worth the visit.   I m not a big fan of the food  it s a tad overrated  but it comes in huge piles and the prices are reasonable. Honestly the real reason you should go is to her a handshake from the man himself 
Juan In A Million,471,Our experience originally was pleasant. We were greeted by a very friendly staff and the service and food was great. The reason I am leaving only one star is the following day after our visit we parked in the back parking lot and started to explore the area.  We were parked maybe 20 minutes and came back to a boot on our vehicle.  The man who worked for the towing company was extremely rude and told us we parked in the lot where if you leave the premises you get a boot tow and explained that Juan in a million restaurant contract them out to do this. The ONLY sign that said no parking and leaving the area is small and only at one entrance to the lot making it almost impossible to see or notice   BE CAREFUL WHEN PARKING IN THE AREA- it cost us  150 to get the boot removed. Sadly  we will not return to the area 
Juan In A Million,472,This place is worth the hype  Came here on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed  but we were able to be seated right away. There s also a large parking lot out back which was a huge plus. They brought out chips and salsa  be warned the salsa is spicy    promptly and all of the staff were very friendly. I ended up getting the Don Juan without bacon  and it was excellent. I d recommend adding a tiny bit of the salsa if you want extra spice  but by itself it is excellent. The portions are also very large.   Overall  it s a great Austin staple with good food and friendly staff. Highly recommend 
Juan In A Million,473,This review is for breakfast tacos only  Man  the owner makes this place so much better  He treats everyone like you are part of the family. The tacos are PACKED full of breakfast food. I can only eat one  but I don t have the biggest stomach. Great service  great food. 5 Stars 
Juan In A Million,474,But really...  Where else can you go in Austin that is authentic Mexican  has very affordable and delicious food  AMAZING Horchatas  friendly staff  friendly owner  and is close proximity to downtown    Not much places. Is it touristy  Sure. But it s a great spot and I think everyone should check it out    The Don Juan taco  a big glass of horchata  and chips  amp  guacamole are my go-to items.
Juan In A Million,475,Get the don Juan. As a smaller person  it was big enough for 2 meals. You can order to-go or dine in.
Juan In A Million,476,In terms of value  this place isn t bad... a super filling Don Juan can leave your stomach packed for lunch and pre-packed for dinner. If Don Juan is the only thing you d get at this restaurant and if you don t mind the lines  the rating would be higher.  But if you want to explore the other aspects of the menu and take into consideration wait times and service  then the rating begins to slip. I ordered the beef fajitas with a side of potatoes today  and the food was good but not swooooon-worthy. The beef was cooked well but didn t have much flavor. It wasn t until I mixed it with the refried beans  guacamole  and potatoes in the tortilla that the flavors started kicking in  but honestly  it was pretty yummy.   The main reason why Juan gets 3 stars from my ballot is the service and wait time. I came with a party of 15  and it took us around 20-30 minutes to get seated even though a  there were many open tables and b  I had told them that the party was willing to split up to expedite the seating process. Ok  so a 20-30 minute wait isn t too bad when your company is A ... but what about waiters charging you for a mistake they made when they took the order   What happened was we ordered 14 Don Juans even though we had 15 people. The waiter  assuming everyone wanted a Don Juan  put down 15. And when we were paying  he and the cashier wouldn t let us leave until we paid for the unpurchased 15th  even though everyone in our party clearly reiterated his her order. A restaurant should prioritize customer experience over a measly profit  and Juan In A Million failed to do so today. I m open to coming back again  but this experience was a let-down for something I d been looking forward to for a while.
Juan In A Million,477,Don Juan. Literally that s it... side of beans and Mexican coke if you re feeling fancy. Soo good.
Juan In A Million,478,It s a must visit place in Austin because Man vs. Food did a challenge here. I ve met the owner and his son a while back  and they were really nice. This is popular hole in the wall place not just because of MvF  but also b c the food is pretty legit for the value.    The  Don Juan  breakfast taco is the best thing here. It s loaded with potato  bacon  egg  and cheese. I m not a fan of potato  but still enjoyed it very much. The flour tortillas are great. The portion is huge for less than  5. It comes with extra tortillas so you can make a butt load of tacos from one taco. The salsa is so spicy that it burns so good.
Juan In A Million,479,Food was deeeeee-lish  Also the line was out the damn door  but literally only had to wait about 15-20 mins for a table  That is pretty awesome considering there was about 5-7 parties waiting. I ordered the con queso breakfast and it was yum  My partner order then famous Don Juan El Taco Grande and it was gigantic   If you are visiting Austin Tx I suggest checking this little place out.
Juan In A Million,480,There is just so much food for so cheap  The food itself wasn t mind blowing but they were good. If you are the type of person who likes the food to be separated neatly and not mushed into one big thing  then this place will likely turn you off because plating things neatly is not something this type of place will do. We had the migas and the Don Juan breakfast tacos. The added sausage to the migas helped the taste in my opinion and the husband said the salsa that came with the chips for free at the table helped make the breakfast tacos less boring. The portion is ridiculously large  deceiving when you see the plate . Both of us barely ate half of what we ordered  I have no idea how someone can eat the entire plate   but you can always take leftovers home with you.  The queso was too runny  but the salsa that came with the chips for free at our table was awesome albeit hot  and no warnings  so eat at your own risk     The restaurant had plenty of seating-we were initially worried that there would be lots of waiting around since it seems popular with the locals but they seated us no problem  they had three distinct seating areas throughout what I guess is a converted house . Try it out  it s plenty cheap and you won t come out hungry 
Juan In A Million,481,I can t even wait to leave the restaurant first before I write this review. Service is fantastic and our server is very attentive. Food was great  although my chicken fajita was a bit dry. Refried bean was delish  I wanted to give 4 1 2 star because of the fajita but the service we had today was so good that made up for it.
Juan In A Million,482,Does not live up to the hype  My wife and  I went here after readIng reviews such as   top 50 in the USA . What a disappointment  under  seasoned  sloppy Tex Mex that wouldn t make it  onto the top 50 breakfast tacos in Austin  100  would not recommend. Also  we did not have our hands shaken by Juan as promised in all of the hype 
Juan In A Million,483,The owner gives the most welcoming handshakes. Careful  it will catch you off guard if you re not careful  The Don Juan is amazing. A pile of bacon  eggs  and cheese. I usually ask for 3 extra tortillas and I can get 4 tacos out of all the fixin s. The lemonade is fresh squeezed every day and doesn t disappoint and the margaritas are delicious. The staff is very welcoming and kind. You feel like your at home when you come here.
Juan In A Million,484,If I had been Yelping when I was a college freshman  this would be the easiest 5 to review in my life. Unfortunately  I think for me that the magic is gone from Juan in a Million.  Of course the Don Juan is worth it - it s an absurdly large amount of food for  5. I was able to get 4 hefty flour tacos from a single plate  and I could feel my stomach rebelling from the amount of food I put in it.  I don t know if it s because the potatoes are in big chunks in comparison to the other main ingredients  cheese  eggs  bacon   but it sort of felt like it was mostly a potato and cheese taco with some eggs and bacon.  Also  the salsa here is no joke. I m pretty sure the salsa is blended and not cut by hand because of how watery it is  and it s ridiculously spicy. I like a tolerable yet spicy heat in certain foods  and this is off the charts bad. It cuts pretty well through the heaviness of the tacos  though.  Still  it s fun to come here and eat one of the most famous dishes in Austin - although I really can t believe who on earth would eat 8 plates of the Don Juan for funsies. I would rather pay an extra couple of bucks for a better breakfast taco elsewhere  though.
Juan In A Million,485,I recently moved to Austin from San Diego  CA and have been in search for tacos that would fulfill my cravings. Juan in a million is definitely Juan in a million. I came here with my boyfriend around noon on a Thursday  and the place was buzzing. We were greeted by Juan himself  and we loved his enthusiasm. He really takes care of you and makes you feel welcome just like family. There was a good amount of people waiting outside  but it only took like 15 minutes max for us to get seated. We ordered the Don Juan El Taco Grande  a must try   a chorizo and potato taco  barbacoa taco  sausage and egg taco  and chips with chile con queso  also a must try . The Don Juan is gigantic  We loved all the tacos and even had leftovers. I believe it cost about  19. Not expensive at all especially for the quantity of food. Overall  safe to say I will be coming here often. Juan in a Million is an Austin staple.
Juan In A Million,486,After spending a few days in Austin  I ve came to realize the huge obsession of the breakfast taco. Out of the few breakfast tacos that I ve tried in Austin this is by far my favorite. I came in on an a Sunday morning around 10am and I got a table right away. I ordered the Don Juan breakfast taco with an extra tortilla. Chips and salsa were brought out first  always a good start. Salsa had a really nice spice to it which I love. Then  taco came out. This taco is freakin HUGE  The amount of filling in this can literally make about 3-4 tacos. The filling of egg  cheese  potato  and bacon was really flavorful and super filling. I would totally come back for one of these breakfast tacos when in Austin.
Juan In A Million,487,We stopped here for breakfast before a hike on a winter day and  despite plenty of space inside  the harsh ladies insisted that we sit outside on the  heated  patio. The heater was concentrated in one section only. And the patio was cold.   I ordered the migas platter with shredded cheese  an extra  1 . The plate arrived smothered with disgusting  queso  sauce. That s not cheese  The migas where hard cooked scrambled eggs with tomato and a few bits of tortilla. Served with regrows beans  which were good  and fried potatoes  nothing special .   Can t recommend this place in a city filled with excellent choices.
Juan In A Million,488,Yep. Come here. Hangover cure of the century. Order the Don Juan with 3 extra tortillas-- Bloody Mary was straight to the point and solid.  Hi Joe 
Juan In A Million,489,Sadly this review is due to the poor service I received. I walked in with 30 min to spare until closing around 2 30pm. We were not well received  welcomed by numerous dirty looks from most of wait staff. We were then rushed to a table.  There were three of us dining and in an attempt to rush to get our drink orders  the server only took 2 3 drink orders  and completely ignored my friend. When I ordered coffee  I was told that they might already be out because they were closing soon. WOW  You are not closed yet  so make me a fresh pot asshole  right   Then when she brought us our coffee  she only brought 2 3 coffees  again ignoring the fact that there were three of us.  Everything seemed to be a chore for our server. Her energy and behavior was very off putting.  We received no refills on drinks or salsa. The food was meh...Seriously felt very unwelcome here. We were not even the last group to come in and be served. Numerous people walked in after us  Very unprofessional. I waited tables for years and its server 101 that you seat people  serve them and do so with respect until the very last minute if you mean to retain customers.   Sorry Juan  very disappointed.
Juan In A Million,490,what a fun place to go  as a college student . They give you massive portions for really cheap prices. Food is delicious  comes out piping hot. Staff always friendly. Their salsa is really really good  a bit spicy but that s perfect. Get the don juan in the morning  take a nap  and then go out and explore austin. Definitely an experience.
Juan In A Million,491,We drove from Houston To Austin and researched top Tex-Mex restaurants and the best rating was for Juan in a Million. I ll start w the positives - the chicken enchiladas  Monterey Jack quesadilla and Fajita soft taco were absolutely delicious w tender meat  tons of cheese and fresh bright vegetables.  The waitress was very warm and friendly and walked us to our table immediately upon entering the restaurant.  That being said  we were not impressed w our bland and boring Margie and Bloody Mary - lacking in flavor and aesthetic appeal. The chips in our basket were obviously from the bottom of the bag  small and broken  so I had to request a basket w actual chips instead of crumbs. Our table was over what looked like a puddle originating from a crack in the tile. The ceiling is filthy  there were napkins  chips  garbage all over the floor. The bathroom is scary and looked like it belonged in the bag of a gas station in the middle of nowhere. There was no music  no Tex-mex  no ambience and quite frankly I was afraid to touch anything really....So  the overall feeling was one of disappointment for the overall environment  but with a feeling of appreciation for their delicious food.
Juan In A Million,492,I ve been hearing great things about this place for years now and it lived up to the hype.  A modest  small neighborhood Tex mex restaurant  unassuming with a simple but well executed menu.  The Don Juan was enormous  I made 4 tacos out of it  all delicious.  I have no idea how Man vs Food ate 4 Don Juan s    But the star of the show for me was the menudo  which I rarely order  but perfect for a cold rainy day.  This Holy Grail for Tex Mex should be on every foodie bucket list
Juan In A Million,493,Juan s is worth a visit for the history and for the experience. You ll want to get there early to score a seat  but even if you have to wait  the owner  Juan   stands at the door and greets everyone with such veracity that it s hard to be upset.   I feel bad saying that these are not my favorite migas or breakfast tacos in town  as though admitting that equates to blasphemy against some part of Austin itself  but I m truly partial to Jo s and feel that I must be up front about it here. The migas taco was very good  the guacamole taco is hilarious  as it is just guacamole  albeit  delicious guacamole  in a soft tortilla. All orders  even breakfast  are served with fresh chips and spicy salsa. The coffee is terrible  but cheap  so you can take it or leave it. The seating area is actually five different seating areas all united under a cloth roof  so you might end up sitting  inside    outside   or in a separate  dining  room.   Juan s is an adventure worth having  but in a city full of options for migas and tacos  it didn t blow me away.
Juan In A Million,494,4.5 5  Heard about this place from our Uber driver who was born and raised in Austin. It s true the Don Juan taco was way more than enough for my fianc  and I. With the chips  salsa and queso we still had a mount of delicious stuffing left  Don t forget to get extra tortillas on the side. Total just  13 and we were so full.   Took away0.5  Star for dirty utensils. Other than that good stuff 
Juan In A Million,495,My boyfriend and I went out of the way to get some breakfast tacos from Juan In A Million.   This is definitely a place where you could just drive by and easily miss it. That being said  around 11 30 am - 12 pm  the line does get bumping outside and draws a crowd. We arrived on a Saturday morning at about 10 30 am and only had to wait for about 10 minutes.   This place is deceivingly big -- There is actually another room that is part of the restaurant in the back that has AC and can seat about another 6-8 tables. This area is where we sat and was actually much less crowded than the first part of the restaurant that you walk into when being seated.   My boyfriend went for the Don Juan  he had 3 tortillas with it  and was able to finish most -- I was impressed  I had one bite and loved the taste of it  too. I had one breakfast taco with chorizo  egg and cheese and then a Miga. The waitress said this was very popular for a breakfast taco and although I do not remember everything in it   it was some sort of combination of egg  cheese  onion  tomato  I do remember that it was very good.   The wait staff is a little slow  so don t come here for a quick bite if you are in a rush. But they are friendly and bring you out a bowl of chips salsa upon your arrival and continuously re-fill your coffee while dining.
Juan In A Million,496,Beware  On Sunday  my friend and I ate breakfast here around 11 am. After we paid  we took her leftovers to my car so we could walk down the block and see a little of the neighborhood.   We were gone for maybe five minutes. When we got back to our car  they d placed a parking boot on my tire.   Juan in a Million boots its own customers cars via its private parking police. Then charges them  150 to get it removed.   The guy who removed the boot explained   We watched y all come back to your car  put your leftovers inside  and then walk away. You left the property so we booted you.   Which means they were staked out  watching us. Instead of saying   Hey  don t walk away or we will have to boot your car   they just let us walk right by. They WANTED that  150. Badly.   I like the crappy food here. But I ll never go back. Because they re more interested in screwing over their customers for a few bucks than being good hosts.   Super gross.
Juan In A Million,497,The service was great we meet Juan and the staff and we felt welcomed as soon as we entered. The rice was really good. Savory and served warm like it should be. The margarita wasn t as strong as I d like it to be. They said I had to buy a shot  Like what  I ve never heard that before but it was good nonetheless. Ps no burritos - 
Juan In A Million,498,The review were so overrated. We were visiting from NY figuring out if we should move to Austin and heard about the place online and tv. But it was disappointing. The service was disappointing. The food was basically things I can make at home. The one major dish they have that tasted very good was their retried beans. I have never had refr es beans like that before and they were delicious. But that s about it. Not going back.
Juan In A Million,499,Service was nice and servers are friendly  They give too much of food in a plate that one can eat. I could only eat little than a half of my plate .  I ordered there breakfast taco option of egg and bacon in taco. Was decent enough - had very high expectations
Juan In A Million,500,Average tasting tacos  average size at an above average price.  This is not a place that I am dying to go back to.  Not terrible but not great.  Also about half of the taco filling that the pictures show.
Tacodeli,1,This place was amazing. During our trip to Austin  Texas we visited this place a few times. They are known for their breakfast tacos and we got a few each time. We tried several and they were all so good. For this location parking was pretty easy  but it does get pretty packed in the morning.  Over the course of several days we were able to try the migas taco  Jess special  the vaquero  Frontera fandido  and akaushi picadilla  amp  eggs. My favorite was the akaushi breakfast taco. It has some ground beef eggs salsa and cilantro. All these tacos go great with their many salsas. And that is just one more thing that I love about this place. The salsas were all fantastic also.
Tacodeli,2,My only complaint is they didn t keep the curbside pickup parking spots. Loved the convenience of popping by while not having to get out of the car when out and about   When I m looking for a quick taco option that never lets down  I like to stop at Taco Deli. It s affordable  the establishment is clean and staff very nice. I ve never had any issues with my food coming from this Tacodeli.   All good things 
Tacodeli,3,This is one busy Taco Deli location. However  the staff is always super friendly. I also love how easy it is to do online ordering. When things get busy  the order might not be ready  but the staff always checked where my order were. I appreciate the small gesture.  My go-to order is just breakfast tacos. I love salsa do a and the tacos are just my vessel to get the salsa into my mouth.  Lastly  this location is right by the Spyglass trail so it s a great reward after we finish our hike.
Tacodeli,4,A particularly cool location tucked away in a neighborhood -- not only the original  but right at the Spyglass Trailhead to the Barton Creek Greenbelt trail.  Stay for a while  with a decent amount of outdoor seating... though a small parking lot  there is street parking.  The always-friendly crew are as inviting as the terrific tacos.  Clean ingredients  not overly complicated  and simply delicious.  Don t forget the queso and horchata 
Tacodeli,5,Yes please...I just don t get over this way enough but I should...Tacos we re amazing  as was the superb service.I got a Migas taco and made the mistake of getting a Barbacoa one as well...personally I don t see how I can order anything else moving forward ..it was so amazing ...one thing I did do is added some sauce which it clearly doesn t need  This taco definitely gave me the excuse to visit more often 
Tacodeli,6,We were visiting family in Austin and we were taking here.   They really hyped it up .   I ordered the following   -MIGAS TACO Scrambled eggs  tomato  onion  jalape o  tortilla chips  jack cheese -THE VAQUERO Scrambled eggs  grilled corn  roasted peppers  jack cheese  I thought the tacos were solid  but definitely not anything to write home about.   I d much rather eat a big breakfast burrito  but I guess these breakfast tacos are the  thing  in Austin.   Nice place with a variety of different tacos but nothing really to make me think - I HAVE to try this again.     Decent stop if you re too tired to make some breakfast tacos yourself at home.
Tacodeli,7,If you aren t going to taco deli  you re doing it wrong. We go just about every weekend and have breakfast tacos at the Spyglass location then hike the greenbelt a bit. The do a sauce is to die for  and we love it drizzled on the Otto  the Jamon taco  and the SEC.   They also have margaritas which are quite tasty and refreshing on a hot day  okay so like 85  of the year .   Tacodeli is one of my favorite things about living in Austin. The only thing I wished they would do is to label their tacos that are corn vs flour as it is hard to divvy up orders for large groups.
Tacodeli,8,Delicious tacos and a very good spot to hang out with friends or family. Definitely will be going back next time going to Austin
Tacodeli,9,This is a great place to grab a taco before or after hiking the nearby greenbelt across the street. There s limited indoor seating and a bunch of picnic tables outside under the shady oak trees. As with most places in Austin  it s dog friendly with thoughtful water bowls out for your pooch.  I got a coffee  amp  two tacos. I d definitely recommend the Frontera Fundido Chicken but found the Cowboy s taco had steak that was a bit dry. My friend s migas taco looked legit though so that s on my list for next time 
Tacodeli,10,Yummy food but it depends on who takes your order as to whether you actually get what you ordered. I find myself having to return to the counter for multiple items that should have been with my meal.
Tacodeli,11,Just ok. I love their horchata and the do a salsa. Don t come here for authenticity  and you ll find you like it  okay   too.   The salads here are pretty good 
Tacodeli,12,Wow wow wow. I love this place. I recommend cowboy and el picosito. Also the sauce was really awesome experience. The line was long but served very fast. Love it 
Tacodeli,13,THE BIG  This location is nicely tucked away in the South Austin area. Parking is tough especially during peak eating hours.  THE BLACK AND WHITE  Fun fact  Tacodeli was my first taco joint I ve visited in Austin and I have to say  their tacos are amazing  I came here with a buddy before going on a rafting trip and the breakfast tacos here held me over until late in the afternoon. I know  It s that hefty and delicious.  I got the Jess Special  which had something called the migas. Apparently migas is just leftover corn tortillas re-invented into a delicious breakfast taco. Big fan  The Vaquero is also good. You can t go wrong with any selection here  THE FINAL BAMBOO  Overall  two tacos was about  7. Not bad and I ll definitely be back again 
Tacodeli,14,How have I never reviewed Tacodeli  I ve been here a hundred times at least. All of the tacos are great. Always fresh ingredients. Great flavors and affordable.  Service is great  although if you re short on time  order on-line - it can take a while when they re busy.
Tacodeli,15,I can only speak to the food via ubereats. I got the  pork belly  shrimp and Barbacado tacos. They were one of the best I ve ever had. Not just in Austin but ever.   The ingredients are obviously fresh  onions  avocado  and protein - shrimp  pork belly and barbacoa . I will definitely be reordering from them.
Tacodeli,16,Delicious  Jess Special is my favorite but I tried the migas taco today and it did not disappoint. Their Salsa Dona really jazzez up the taco 
Tacodeli,17,We went here for dinner a No tried two of their plates.  One was the flank steak.  It was good but the meat was a little tough.  The scallops were good but the entree was rather small  especially for the price.  I think I will stick to having their tacos next time.
Tacodeli,18,Very mediocre tacos  basically just fast food for Texas. Kinda pricy too per taco  would rather get some better Tex Mex tacos or Tijuana style tacos than this.
Tacodeli,19,Came here based on a friend s recommendation and glad we did.  They do have a small parking lot  which isn t always a given in the Austin area.  Seating is limited inside as our family took their only table for 4  although they do have outdoor seating both in front of the building as well as to the side.    We arrived just before 11 00  which is when they switch over from their breakfast taco options to their lunch options  but they said we could order from either menu.  You also may choose your tortilla from flour  corn  or wheat.  I stuck to 3 from the lunch menu  the Heather   3.95   grilled queso fresco  refried black beans  guac  lettuce  amp  tomato  Space Cowboy   4.25   baby portabella mushrooms  corn  peppers  onion  guac  amp  queso fresco  and Papadulce   3.95   sweet potato  corn  roasted pepper  onion  toasted pepitas  amp  chipotle-camote sauce.  All 3 were generously filled  different than anything I have had elsewhere  and tasted amazing.  Bottom line  I highly recommend a visit to this place as the service is fast and friendly  the prices are reasonable  and the tacos are amazing.
Tacodeli,20,Tacodeli is always so busy when I go  which is a testament to how popular it really is    The staff are always so friendly and really go the extra mile to help.  I got Frontera Fundido with shrimp - decent taco  i can t eat dairy so I got it without cheese but it honestly kind of lacked flavor.  Also got the vaquero taco - pretty standard taco  huge serving of egg.  I got the hot sauce with both  not spicy at all  would recommend the 4th spicy option if I were to come again.   Pretty good price for the breakfast tacos 
Tacodeli,21,I ordered the most popular dish  the Cowboy Taco. The dry-rubbed beef tenderloin was very flavorful but could have been slightly more tender and juicy. The guacamole and queso fresco was the perfect amount of spicy to add just the right amount of kick to the taco.
Tacodeli,22,Conveniently located near an entry point to the greenbelt  this location gets bonus points for being nearby a walking attraction  but a ding for limited parking as a result. Very few designated parking lot spots and many cars on the street normally. The offerings are a wide variety but not overly remarkable on their own. The best bit is the do a salsa  which you can now buy at select grocery stores. This is one of several TacoDeli locations that offer two different dinner plate options after 4 PM. We tried both and would not have them again. The mole sauce was overly spiced and bitter. The rice was also a miss. The plate would be better served with the potato side they offer throughout the rest of the day. From a taco standpoint the otto  the shrimp fondido  and the jess special are your best options.
Tacodeli,23,Came here on a Friday afternoon and ordered the shrimp salad. The line moved somewhat slowly  and the food also came out somewhat slowly. I enjoyed the salad and the queso very much  They also have 4 different salsas of varying heat intensity. The ambiance is casual  and it wasn t difficult to secure a table for 5 people at the time we went.   Overall the service was friendly but could have been better. My friend  the bachelorette for a bachelorette s party  ordered a swirled marg but it didn t come with a swirl. After bringing this up to staff  they simply handed her the juice for the swirl instead of remaking it. Now  for normal occasion  this would have sufficed  but I was disappointed to see that they did not show extra effort for such an important occasion.
Tacodeli,24,Went to Tacodeli today to eat tacos after hearing so much about the place. It was sprinkling a little bit when we went and there wasn t too much of a line which was nice. I ended up ordering    cowboy - I liked this taco - all the flavors went pretty well together   frontera fundido sirloin - DIDNT like this taco - really lacked any flavor and the meat was a little tough   large queso - this was good and edible but not great. Don t think I d order again - wish the queso was thicker for sure. Came with chips but wasn t fresh unfortunately   Overall I d go to try the cowboy and maybe the Delhi belly which my friend said was good but other items were not yummy.
Tacodeli,25,We ordered breakfast tacos for the first time today and we ordered 2 migas tacos. They had mostly cheese in them  very little egg and no tortillas  On top of that they were cold when we got them home.  This was our first and last experience.
Tacodeli,26,Love love love Tacodeli  Easily one of my favorite places to get tacos in Austin. I live super close so I ended up joining their rewards program since it s so convenient and good   I always get the el pollosito  but this time I also got the carne asada. Both were really good  but the el pollosito will always be my favorite. I am also a big fan of their dona sauce   This sauce is a must if you like spicy things  Back when we were in the office  we would order Tacodeli all the time for meetings. Breakfast tacos were always easy to get if it was a morning meeting and then chips and queso were a must for afternoon meetings   They have made online ordering and contactless pick up extremely easy during covid. Every time I have ordered online  it s ready within 10 minutes max  which gives me just enough time to order and then walk over to go pick it up immediately. While the indoor dining is closed  they still have a good amount of outside seating too 
Tacodeli,27,I come to this location constantly  and they do have fantastic tacos. But today  one of their staff was wearing a shirt that said  All My Homies Hate Gregg Abbott.   Now  I realize that I live in hyper-liberal Austin  and I shouldn t expect a local taco chain to be adorned with Ted Cruz stickers. But I also don t think the workplace is an appropriate place to make political statements  especially when you might have a lot of customers who don t agree with them.  Keep making great tacos. But leave the politics out of it.
Tacodeli,28,love this tacos. I wish they open a location near Hill Country Galleria
Tacodeli,29,Updated Review  This place has totally gone downhill. They once had great staff and not any more... The last 4 or 5 times I ve been there they have totally left me feeling completely dissatisfied. Miss the old Taco Deli.
Tacodeli,30,Great place to grab breakfast tacos in Austin. There was outdoor seating here and it was dog friendly  No indoor seating when I went  but a very streamlined process where you ll go in and order  and your order will be called out for you.   Veracruz ends up tasting and feeling more authentic but this place is fun to check out as well 
Tacodeli,31,Went there around 8pm on a Saturday night. Cool people and a great vibe. Great for a first date because it s nice sitting outdoors and not crowded by any means. Great tacos and margs. I am grateful I live nearby. Will be back   
Tacodeli,32,It was alright. I ordered a bunch of tacos and they weren t as memorable. I think the cowboy was the best out of the bunch. I tried the queso with chips. The chips wasn t fresh and I am not a fan of queso in general. The best thing about this location is all the different sauces that can match your preference of heat.
Tacodeli,33,I went into the store at 8pm tonight and the salsa pumps were already down. I requested some from the manager angel Flores and was denied and told they were out of all three salsas. And then proceeded to hand someone else salsa in front of me right after. Love the customer service here.
Tacodeli,34,Wow  amazing tacos here. I was recommended to try them out by some of my friends. Definitely exceeded my expectations 
Tacodeli,35,The breakfast tacos at tacodeli are elite.. I eat at tacodeli at least once a week  I m completely addicted to the Otto breakfast taco.. cannot recommend this place enough. Additionally  the staff is always super friendly and welcoming. The salsa bar is always stocked and clean. Great environment to bring friends and family.
Tacodeli,36,Morning  noon  night. I could eat Tacodeli for every meal. My waistline is thankful that there s not one  yet  in Denver. But I do beeline to the closest location whenever in Austin.   The Otto breakfast taco is just the right amount of beans  bacon  avocado. And this time I tried the steak and egg brekkie taco as well.   And the queso. Don t even get me started on the queso. It s on the thinner side  which is much more palpable after a steamy morning walk.   Pro hangover tip  Mix the sparkling water with OJ in a cup. Helps keep the taste buds alive.
Tacodeli,37,I got the sirloin  egg and cheese  and a chicken Happy Taco.  Fresh ingredients  great hot sauces  cool atmosphere 
Tacodeli,38,Shrimp taco with poblano pepper and onion rajas is very good  plump fresh shrimp. Salmon taco could be mistaken for meat because of its spicy seasoning. Highlight  refried black beans are really tasty.
Tacodeli,39,Quality of the food is top notch.  Wait times can vary but the atmosphere is easy to be in.  Love  love  love the Dona salsa.
Tacodeli,40,Taco Deli - Another good stop along the 30-bus line.  Their tacos were fresh  healthy  and reasonably priced  but bland.  Nevertheless  if you re on the 30-bus out to Bee Cave  stop in for a couple of breakfast  only breakfast menu available before 11 AM  or regular  tacos  sit on the terrace  and people watch.
Tacodeli,41,Good atmosphere  decent food. The one on North Lamar is better. Still pretty cool to have one close by.
Tacodeli,42,Angel was really kind and the reason I ll be coming back to this taco deli  besides the amazing refried black beans     
Tacodeli,43,Oh my God. Really  Pork Belly in a taco    The best tacos I ve ever had. Their take on concoctions delicately placed within flour or corn taco shells  all soft  is the epitome fusion with a Tex Mex twist. Oh and their queso  Perfectly melted for the homemade chips. Outdoor dining area for a great lunch stop.
Tacodeli,44,I wanted to try the bkfs tacos but by the time I arrived breakfast was over. I know....  Around liinch there was a looong line but it moved fairly quickly. The cashier was super friendly and helpful. As someone who does not eat meat she  recommended to order the taco with salmon   Tikin Xic   and the Heather. Both were good but I liked the salmon taco a bit more. It had a lot of flavors. There are three different salsas to choose from. All are really good.  The tacos are very fresh.   I wish this place was close to my house...
Tacodeli,45,They got the order wrong but who even cares when the tacos are so good.  I would gladly eat any of their tacos that randomly show up in my bag 
Tacodeli,46,Breakfast  lunch  or dinner  This place is always a good stop in. Order to go often as well  always quick. You can also order ahead of time on their app and earn rewards.
Tacodeli,47,I don t get it.  Extremely salty food. Too much salt in the tacos and salsas. Corn tortillas are not grilled very well.   I guess being from LA we expect a bit more from a taco and this was just not it.  Might have been an off day but every taco was off. Hate saying this about a beloved establishment but my tongue is burning from all the salt on my food.   Maybe breakfast tacos are better.  We tried  - POLLO ADOBADO  3 5  - dry  not a great chipotle flavor   - TACOLOCO  3 5  - the meat itself was tasty but the guacamole tasted bad and it only had one mushroom slice in the whole taco. The flavors didn t mesh well at all  - TIKIN XIC -  1.5 5  - SO MUCH SALT that I had to spit out my taco because the amount of salt burned my tongue. The salmon itself was tasty once I wiped off the seasoning.   - SHRIMPOSITO -  2.5 5  - good portion of 4 shrimps in the taco but way too much adobo sauce and it overpowered the taco with a flavor that wasn t it to begin with.   Tried each of the salsas and none of them had much flavor or enhanced the tacos.  Sorry Austin  this place is not it.
Tacodeli,48,This is my favorite Tacodeli location to date. Why  It s located right across the Spyglass entrance to the Greenbelt  which means  TACOSSS  After a few hours on the greenbelt  I am starving. Tacodeli has been my savior on more than one occasion. What s even better  Breakfast is served until 3 on weekends    My all time favorite has to be the Migas or Jess Special loaded with La Do a sauce on the side. Unfortunately  you can t splurge and serve yourself like you would in the past due to coronavirus precautions.   Indoor dining is prohibited  but outdoor seating is available  along with social distancing guidelines.
Tacodeli,49,Preface  Take this review with a grain of salt because I ve obviously got other stuff going on  which is also why it s gonna be a 5 star review because this place is otherwise pretty awesome..  Was already having a bad day. Placed my order on the app and asked for my soft drink cup so I could get a drink while I waited for the rest of my order to be called. Then the manager     with the neck tat comes and sits down next to me in the dining area and semi-jokingly asks  why you lyin to me  man   I just proceeded to pull up the app with a confused look on my face.. at this point I m obviously slightly embarrassed as well. So when I pulled up the app the drink page was up and it was asking me  what kind of quesadilla I wanted  with my drink. So I m assuming some sort of software issue  Or maybe I just fat fingered it or something  Regardless  I just closed and reopened the app and reordered a drink. Honest mistake either way. Then when my order was called I went and gave them a heads up that I d reordered  and paid for  the drink. The response I got was like a snide sarcastic little comment along the lines of  well that s weird  I wonder why it came in as 2 separate orders... but it s all good.  Like he was still accusing me of trying to steal a  3 drink from the TacoDeli I m at about every other day. I m gonna do my best to forget about this encounter and I ll probably delete this comment soon tbh. I m obviously making it a bigger deal than it needs to be but that s only because this was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back in this shit day I m having.  But yeah  Other than this one situation  every other visit has been awesome.
Tacodeli,50,Still operating during covid for take out or pick up curbside. I m not a huge fan of any of the other tacos but the bean and cheese taco.
Tacodeli,51,The food is AMAZING    I don t like tacos  I went because my sibling wanted to and boy was it worth it   The cashier at the front  I didn t get his name  was very friendly and informative. He helped suggested a few items that we loved. The other staff is very friendly and the whole place is very clean and has welcoming decor. Definitely a great place to stop by for any locals and travelers 
Tacodeli,52,my favorite tacos in Austin  Simple and delicious tacos with the best homemade salsa Try the Do a salsa 
Tacodeli,53,Finally made it to the Tacodeli that s closest to me. It s poppin  alright.  I first heard of Tacodeli s tacos when I was at Caffe Medici downtown. They sold Tacodeli breakfast tacos  but only a select few. I had their bean and cheese and was floored. It was so deliciously gooey and soft. I knew I had to make it to one of their brick and mortars. Fast forward a few months  and I finally made it to this one.   It was buuusyyy on the Saturday lunchtime we went. My friend got three tacos  and I had two. They have tons of veggie-friendly options. Whoot  They have a specials board on your right while you wait in line and a large menu overhead. I wish their large menu had prices on it...but weirdly enough the prices are on their smaller handheld menus. They also have outdoor seating area that can accommodate for multiple group sizes  so we chose to sit outside at their barstool area. They have serve-yourself water. Their breakfast tacos are the best in the game so far  but the unfortunate thing is parking. Their lot isn t spacious  especially with the hiking trail nearby. But there are some spaces for street parking along the main street  so that s a plus.   Tacodeli is a staple in Texas. I think their breakfast tacos are a force to be reckoned with. BUT the wait time and them being open only during the day deters me from going here compared to other spots like Veracruz or Papalote.
Tacodeli,54,BEST PLACE for tacos    Especially breakfast tacos  amazing atmosphere and very friendly staff  Every time I go here I have the best experience  HIGHLY recommend 
Tacodeli,55,I do not know why this place has such good reviews. I mean given  the actual tacos are pretty good  but the breakfast tacos are definitely not. Literally just the most basic scrambled eggs  with meh toppings and unmelted cheese. It s not that it was super bad  it just tasted like a breakfast taco i would eat in a hospital. It amazes me that the line was out the door too.. Go to Veracruz or Tacojoint if you want some actually food bfast tacos
Tacodeli,56,Some of my favorite tacos in Austin. The new picosita and pollosita tacos have become my new favorites  since even without dairy they still retain a unique and delicious flavor. The guac here isn t as good  but the chip quality is superior. And of course the Salsa Do a has my heart  so I always order a generous portion with my order for later.
Tacodeli,57,This is prime example of the problems with Yelp in Austin. Everything is heavily overrated.   Stopped by for a first time today.   The indoor seating area is extremely limited and very very tight. Be ready to rub chins and ears with the people surrounding you.   Let s start with the good. Service is relatively quick for the influx of customers.   And now the rest.   Ordered some guacamole and queso. Neither of which live to potential of their names.   The queso  Or yellow colored mild cream flavored water. I mean seriously one of the worst quesos I have ever had. Super watery and no flavor profile.   The guacamole  Which has NO tomato onion or garlic in it. Had an extreme salt and lime flavor. Once again too overpowering in salt and lime to have any type of delight whatsoever.   The chips where in plastic bags so nothing fresh in that aspect.   The tacos  Delibelly- the presentation was nice. But upon closer inspection the pork was underwhelming. Very little flavor coming for pork belly. Majority of the flavor came from the onion and the afterthought of the sauce on top.   The tacoloco-  once again unimpressive. Strong salt flavor that overpowered anything coming from the shredded beef. And the guacamole was as awful as listed above.   And the icing on the cake where the tortillas. They were even warm....  usually I ll have a taco that at least was pulled off the flattop for a quick warming  I mean chipotle does it . Truly overrated and can t believe there is more than one location.   All in all the food was edible to say the least but certainly not a place I would recommend to anyone.   Best thing to order here would be the almond horchata. Which I m sure was just added in by a third party.
Tacodeli,58,Two words. Mash. Potatoes. To die for. Add them in any taco you get. I promise you won t regret it.
Tacodeli,59,As a long time customer  my recent experience with TD was time wasting  maddening  and my last   I ordered online to pick up in Westlake. The online ordering was slow and things would drop out of the cart. Took too long  but finally paid and arrived 2 minutes early to pick up. Waited and waited  finally asked a staffer to check order. He finally returned and said they couldn t find my order. By then  25 minutes  I was too pressed for time to wait for a redo. Asked for refund  they said it would happen that night. Of course it didn t. waited a couple days  and called twice. And realized they DO NOT ANSWER THE PHONE. Had to call another store  talked to a manager that said they would call me and refund the order. They did refund but of course they did not call  What a time waster. Can t imagine ever returning  since there are many restaurants that don t waste your time and deserve your business so much more than Taco Deli.
Tacodeli,60,Tacodeli is the best In Austin.  It s consistent.  They have the most creative combinations.  The service is always good.  I ll go out of my way for Tacodeli.
Tacodeli,61,Went yesterday and ordered a mushroom  Space Cowboy  and got a  Cowboy   which is a beef version of the taco I ordered. Being vegan  I sent it back  requested the correct taco  and chalked it up to a mishearing. No big deal. In about five minutes I get the proper mushroom taco delivered to me  which I eat until about halfway through when I found a big chunk of beef in my mouth. How this happens I don t know  but I hadn t experienced such a mistake in years. Very dissatisfied.
Tacodeli,62,Naturally I wanted to check out this place based on all the great reviews. Unfortunately  I went at peak lunch time  around 12 30 on a Saturday. The line was out the door and there was another long line for people who called in their orders or were picking up for Postmates UberEats.   It didn t take a long time to order three tacos...that part actually moved pretty quickly. With all the people  I definitely anticipated waiting but not nearly as long as I did. 50 minutes later  I finally got the THREE tacos I ordered.   I ordered the Frontera Fundido Chicken  Mexico City Chicken and the Tikin Xic. Of the 3  the Frontera was the best but none were worth the almost hour long wait. Maybe I d need to visit during a less busy time since I seem to disagree with the vast majority of the reviews.
Tacodeli,63,They feed me breakfast like 3-4 times a week    Thank you Taco Deli employees   Only thing I wish is that they had more vegan options like JUST EGG and no butter in their egg tacos. But I adore Tacodeli. Thank you    
Tacodeli,64,This is an order at the counter type joint. They have a bunch of outdoor tables. They had sanitization stuff to wipe down your table.  We got a bunch of tacos with lots of sauces  Everything was bomb  Def hits the spot for breakfast .
Tacodeli,65,Second time here in this location to bring a 1st timer . Good as expected. Nice outdoor seating  with lots of shades.
Tacodeli,66,Tucked away off loop 1  Mopac  and Spyglass  great little spot with great breakfast tacos.
Tacodeli,67,Great spot for a quick bite. The place has good no. Of vegan and vegetarian taco options. Ordering the food was simple. The food came in quickly. We loved their tacos. The prices of these tacos were fair and good. The food was delicious. You could sit outside in COVID-19 if u wish to. Overall good experience 
Tacodeli,68,Freshly  made to order tacos and some of the nicest folks you ll ever meet at this location. I enjoy coming here because of the service and consistency of the ingredients. Keep being awesome  Spyglass Tacodeli 
Tacodeli,69,I went to Austin prepared with a list of places I wanted to eat at it  and almost didn t make it to this one. But I m soooo glad I did.   I knew they closed at 3 so had to haul ass to get there by 2 45. And unlike other places that are about to close  the staff was still extremely inviting and friendly. Nobody was irritated that we came right before closing  and we weren t the only ones .   I don t remember what exactly I ordered  but I do remember that I could have eaten it for the rest of my life and died happy.   There are all sorts of birds on the patio. And I personally found them really entertaining. But- there s a sign that asks you politely not to feed them...   BUT I HAD TO   I tried to make my rebellion slightly less awful by leading them into the far end of the parking lot and feeding them my chips there  but- I m sorry taco deli  I misbehaved
Tacodeli,70,This spot was surprisingly good. I got the cowboy taco and the mojo salmon taco with the Dona salsa. The meat and salmon were very juicy and had really good seasoning on them. The Dona sauce was a little spicy and not overpowering.
Tacodeli,71,Incredible customer service - friendly  accommodating  with wonderful suggestions for items off the menu. It s definitely a chain  but a great one at that. Just be cautious of the SPICY food   
Tacodeli,72,My go to here is the cowboy and pork belly tacos  I love taco deli and I feel like these are one of the cleaner tacos in Austin.   While waiting for my tacos one day  this lady turned to me and told me that she likes sipping on the red salsa while she waits for her tacos. Ever since that day I ve been sipping on that red salsa while I waited for my tacos here. Is that weird  Haha it s pretty good though.  Follow me on insta  eatwithlilz   eatwithlilz
Tacodeli,73,Had some of these tacos at the farmers market but having it fresh is on a whole different end of the spectrum. I love their homemade flour tortillas and while their meats are delicious  I felt that they were a tad too salty.   The queso is good and I love that they have the prickly pear drink on tap.  The salsa bar is also great and I really liked the light green jalapeno garlic one 
Tacodeli,74,Not a fan of the name but definitely a fan of the food. The combination of flavors and spices are amazing. I love that they use quality ingredients and the staff are super friendly. The prices are a little high but still a great place to eat
Tacodeli,75,Favorite chain tacos in town  The deli belly and chicken fundido are my go-to tacos. There are a lot of locations and most local coffee shops have breakfast tacos from Taco Deli. Easy access and affordable.
Tacodeli,76,Tacodeli.  Yum   It s always my first choice when my boss is ordering food for the office.  And of course  I just love  it  period.  It s one of the few places where you can get refried black beans for tacos.  The bean  amp  cheese tacos are delicious.  Their queso is pretty good  too.  Chips come in individual sealed packages to keep them  fresh and whole.  I have mixed emotions about all that plastic waste  though.  Call ahead or order online to have it waiting for you when you arrive.
Tacodeli,77,I would have given 4.5  maybe even 5  but I only tried one taco. I feel like I need more to get a full feel. But the shrimposito taco was delicious as was the sauces available for topping. Generous portion of avocado too   We also tried the chips and guac  and at first I thought the guac was a little heavy on cilantro - but the after bite had a great spicy kick to it  Unexpected and appreciated. Balanced out the cilantro nicely.   Service is nice  you order at the counter  try to find a seat  a bit limited during a busy lunch hour   and they walk around with your food calling your name. It works. They also cleaned the table for us just as we were finishing up.
Tacodeli,78,Good environment and a friendly staff  I loved the food and the cheese and dip was excellent 
Tacodeli,79,The best thing just happened. After two years  Taco Deli has started making the Veggie Nut Chorizo again. I have just had the happiest experience eating my tacos - does this mean the pandemic is really over   jk  The only thing that would make me even happier would be if they would put the Popeye back on the menu so I didn t have to create my own  Love you Taco Deli  and Thank you 
Tacodeli,80,This was my first visit to any Tacodeli and my friends said this the original one. I got the Frontera Fundido Chicken taco and it was really good  Big chunks of chicken and peppers and onions on flour tortilla  it was great. They also have Maine soda which I love. It was nice so we ate outside  there were a bunch of picnic tables and they brought the food out to us which was cool. The area was clean  lots of children playing  and the Barton Creek trail is like a minute away. I would love to go again and try more of the menu.
Tacodeli,81,Conveniently located right beside the trail  this place is perfect for power breakfast before hiking or to refresh right after  I wanna say 4 for for breakfast tacos and the atmosphere and 3 for the lunch tacos.  Mojo Fish The mojo fish was a little too fishy and I usually deal pretty well with seafood flavors. It was also way too salty.  Puerco Verde We also got the puerco verde and I think this one was better than the mojo fish. They definitely had a lot of flavor but also a lot of sodium....   Breakfast Taco  Don t remember which one it was but it was the one with eggs and bacon. This one wasn t too salty because the egg balanced out the strong meat and sauce flavors well. Pretty good   Overall it wasn t bad but there are so many competitors who do it better. I feel like I would give this place a 5 star if I wasn t in Texas but I ve had better at other taco places in Austin and Houston.
Tacodeli,82,I have been getting Tacos from the Taco Deli on Spyglass for many years. They remain my  go to  taco place - reliably delicious
Tacodeli,83,Best Tacos in Austin  I ve been to Mexico City and this is the closest to it in Austin.   They have multiple locations in town and even distribute some of their breakfast tacos at certain Coffee shops around Austin.   The breakfast tacos are so good  My favorites are   -The Vaquero  -Jess Special  -Frontera Fundido  For lunch  they are even better      My favorite of all time is the Pollo Fant stico. Other good ones are   -Carne Asada  -Mexico City Sirloin   -El Conquistador   -Puerco Verde     Also  the chips and queso are quite tasty and all of the salsas are on point    The only thing to note is that most of their locations in town close at 3pm. During peak hours  it can get crowded.   Lastly  they also cater which is likewise very well done. My company orders from Taco Deli from time to time and its always so good.
Tacodeli,84,Great breakfast tacos  love the frontero fundidos - and best queso in Austin   It s well-liked so sometimes there is a wait but it s worth it 
Tacodeli,85,I am absolutely flabbergasted that this place served me a breakfast taco with mashed potatoes. I understand I ordered a build your own- but if you re going to serve MASHED POTATOES on a BREAKFAST TACO you need to warn your customers because WHO THE FUCK WOULD DO THAT       Truly bizarre and disgusting    I just wanted papas and eggs like a normal human  I already knew this place served subpar tacos but this experience was just beyond and I m almost too confused to be angry about it. If you can go literally anywhere else for a breakfast taco  i would   The redeeming qualities is the space cowboy and all the salsas are excellent 
Tacodeli,86,I had the migas plate. It s a stretch to call them migas. The eggs were either powder or liquid  most definitely not fresh. I could be wrong but the texture was nothing I ve had from fresh eggs.  No tortilla strips in them either. To their defense they offered to replace them because the  mix  wasn t up to par as breakfast was near end. I declined because the addition of strips wouldn t have helped them anyways. Friendly staff that did their best to make it right  but line staff can only do so much to correct a decision made above them in the chain of command.    I recommend you head over to La Grange to Taqueria Rio Verde and get their migas plate and then go back to the drawing board.
Tacodeli,87,Fast  clean   amp  friendly service  Outdoor sitting  Kid  amp  vegetarian friendly menu  Nice to be back in austin 
Tacodeli,88,LET ME PREFACE WITH  I m a first generation Mexican-American that lives in Southern California so I KNOW what real tacos are but I understand the tacos craze people have in Austin. I ve also been to Austin several times and I ve had my share of  breakfast tacos  out here.   LOCATION  Parking can get tough. It s across the street from Barton Springs so both tacos fanatics and the springs  visitors take up the parking. There is limited seating inside but ample seating outside but BEWARE for the hungry birds because they like those tacos.   SERVICE  They really run a tight ship in there. We went on a Saturday morning during prime breakfast taco time so make sure you have your order ready by the time you get up to order  If you re sitting outside the workers will walk your tacos outside and call out your name.   FOOD  So everyone keeps saying that these are the best tacos in Austin but I d have to disagree. I m not saying they re not good because they are delicious  and they have a huge menu  but I still wouldn t say they re the absolute best  I had the Shrimpisito and Pollo con mole. I ll have to say my favorite part about coming here was there medium spicy hot sauce - it s delicious and perfectly spicy    TIP  While your friend orders make sure you look for a table because it can get tricky when it s super busy.   So will I come back  Yeah  why not 
Tacodeli,89,Taco-mazing   These are some awesome tacos. Probably one of the best I ve had.   Food  So I got 3 tacos  carne asada  cowboy  and chicken mole. Everyone was better than the other one. Perfect heat and spice and packed with flavor. They re honestly amazing. Tortillas were soft and they packed the tacos well.   Service decor  Service was ok here. The people were nice but it did take a while to get our food  but then again they were pretty busy. Also decor was ok I guess stand in line order and find a seat
Tacodeli,90,Self-proclaimed taco aficionado Noah Kagan said the Cowboy Taco at Tacodeli was the best taco in the world.   I disagree. There are better tacos in Austin. However  this is a great taco. The taco is made of   Cowboy-rubbed beef tenderloin with grilled corn  caramelized onions and roasted peppers  topped with guacamole and queso fresco.  The beef tenderloin was excellent. It was tender  deeply smoky and seasoned  and savoury. Unfortunately the other elements of the taco  corn  onions  peppers  dominated the flavor profile. The delicious beef got lost in the mix.   The cowboy taco is trying to do too much. It s attempting to dominate the palate with both the veggies and the beef  which ends up being a mess. That being said  all the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. It did not have the flavor focus on the main protein that I d prefer  leaving me feeling I hadn t really even eaten a taco but some kind of veggie wrap with cheese and guac.
Tacodeli,91,This one is the OG.  Take you dog  get a taco and walk the dog by Zilker creek.  Best way to start your day.
Tacodeli,92,Cowboy and shrimposito were our faves. So flavorful    We tried the mojo salmon too but didn t like the flavors as much as the other tacos   You can order online before and they will bring the food to your car when you arrive.   We just walked in to order and sat on their  outdoor patio to eat.
Tacodeli,93,This is the perfect balance between a true taco with a little bit of culinary swag. Plenty of outdoor seating and the menu is quite vast. I had a great early lunch with my tacos. The star though was the queso  Solid bite and definitely enjoyed my meal outdoor on their patio.
Tacodeli,94,Better than your average taco - fer sure.  Love the breakfast tacos.  The guacamole is too hot for my taste buds  looks like they pur e the jalape os  so I ll be opting out of Guac next time.  Great selection 
Tacodeli,95,The food here is exceptional  even better after a hike at the nearby Greenbelt Trails.  It is pup friendly  so you can sit outside  enjoy your tacos and enjoy.   However the space is small  so if it is raining or cold  you have to take it to go or tolerate the weather.  Also  the staff tends to be pretty brash - but that is probably because it is so constantly busy - it s loud and everyone is waiting.  If you re there on a Friday or Saturday for lunch  get the ceviche special. And add some Do a sauce.
Tacodeli,96,Taco deli was my first experience to tacos in Austin and I am hooked.  I love their fresh ingredients.    What I love more is they seem to hire the best people - everyone I ve encountered there is super nice.
Tacodeli,97,AMAZING TACOS IN AUSTIN       Although many people talk about torchys tacos  these were much better.   The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and spent a lot of time with us while we decided what to get. They style of the restaurant is one in which you stand in line and order and then sit at a table until the food arrives. This was a relatively quick place for lunch. Although we did get parking  the parking lot is a tad bit small. This is also conveniently close to Barton Springs Pool  so the short drive over after swimming is nice.   I got the Shrimpocito and Pollo Mole tacos. The Shrimpocito had excellent flavor and the shrimp were perfectly grilled. The pollo mole tacos were absolutely superb    It is the best mole I have had in years and the chicken was perfect    The queso was average  but the salsas in their salsa bar area were fantastic. I recommend the verde salsa  it s not spicy but has great flavor.   I look forward to coming back here again.
Tacodeli,98,For the longest time  I avoided this place and I don t have a good reason for it. A friend dragged me here because she loves it and the taco she recommended honestly changed my life. Cheese  bean and mashed potato on flour... y all  this is what I dream about nowadays. You can build your own taco and or choose from the many delicious creations they have on the menu. Whatever you get  make sure to add some sauce for even more taste. The tacos are small but filling so two usually do the job for me.  What else is there left to say  The prices are cheap and the taste is quality which makes Tacodeli a chain I m definitely not getting tired of anytime soon 
Tacodeli,99,Normally the sirloin egg and cheese has large chunks of steak. I have no idea what this greasy slop is. Hamburger  Sad.
Tacodeli,100,Hipsters and dogs everywhere.......and I don t hang out with dogs or Hipsters.  The only reason I come here is b c my friend has great memories of going here when he went to UT and so now when we take our annual trip to ATX we have to drive away from home  Houston  to go here in the morning for overpriced tacos.  Let me also say I just love sitting outside on a warm summer muggy central Texas morning under trees that have birds dropping bombs all around you.....of the very scraps they have scavenged of the previous customers spilled plates.  Duces 
Tacodeli,101,Can t believe I haven t reviewed this place yet. Top 2 breakfast tacos in Austin hands down. By far the best chain bfast tacos. So good they re offered in every market in town. Of course you have to get them fresh for it to truly shine. The build your own is the best option here  it s bountiful  cheap  fresh  and truthfully delicious. Queso is the only thing that leaves a little to be desired. Go on saturdays  one of the only times you can get bfast and lunch tacos at the same time. For those that like spicy  get the Torreados. It ll blow your mind  and probably blow a few other things a few hours later.   Their salsas are an Austin staple. It s truly changed the Austin taco landscape. My favorite combo  chorizo  Rajas  mashed potatoes  egg. You ll never need another taco. Do yourself a favor and get here early before the line is out of the door  better yet  order ahead.   Lastly  I love this location. Perfect spot to go before a hike and dip in the green belt just steps away.
Tacodeli,102,the food is tasty and fresh. get the cowboy    it s soooo good. the queso is tasty but it s very thin  so if you don t like that just know that it s not thick at all.
Tacodeli,103,Delicious tacos   I d recommend getting a few tacos and pick a variety if it s your first time.  The staff will be more than happy to help you out 
Tacodeli,104,The cowboy taco is one of the best tacos I ve had in Austin  Their queso is also pretty incredible.
Tacodeli,105,4.5. Taco Deli never ceases to amaze me with the extreme quality of their tacos and ingredients.   I stopped by with coworkers at this newly renovated location today  on National Taco Day     The line flowed quickly  staff were friendly as ever  and they even let us try their jalape o lime agua fresca before committing    I ordered the pollo adobado and tacoloco because they re two of my favorites.  Both on wheat tortillas of course. The pollo adobado comes with cilantro and onions and these flavors are just wow   The tacoloco has the infamous guacamole and queso fresco on top and the beef is just too tender and delicious.   I made a side salsa of the verde and the the medium to add just the right amount of spice. If you so dare  try the thicker green sauce that looks like it would be mild  but beware. It s spicy. A little goes a long way.   The jalape o lime agua fresca wasn t spicy really. Quite refreshing and addictive. I gulped it down before I even got my tacos. Oops.   Taco Deli is a must. And it s my favorite taco in Austin. Enough said.
Tacodeli,106,Upon arrival  the staff was very welcoming and gave us an orientation to the menu and gave recommendations. I got the happy taco and the cowboy  and we ordered a side of queso.  The queso was rather bland and drippy  but really nothing compares to Torchy s where they put guac in the queso.  The happy taco was good. It had shredded chicken  jack cheese  mushrooms. There were very few mushrooms.  The cowboy had steak with roasted peppers and corn  guacamole  and queso fresco. It was excellent and I recommend  The steak was a little dry but the roasted vegetables and guacamole were amazing   I recommend this place if you are looking to explore new taco shops.
Tacodeli,107,A few years ago I ordered 3 eggs. I know what 3 scrambled  Vital Farm  eggs look like. What I got was their idea of 3 eggs  maybe 1 egg equivalent . That s not right. So  fast forward to another try in 2020. I ordered 3 tacos  whole wheat  eggs  and refried black beans.   Again  3 tacos is equivalent to the size of one taco. What am I missing  Why do pictures online look different than what I am getting  Am I ordering the wrong thing  My tacos were limp  sad  small  and 1 3 of the sloppy potatoes always end up on the tin foil. Alas.
Tacodeli,108,We arrived too late for the coveted breakfast tacos.  Womp womp.  But the bomb diggity chips and queso totally made up for it.  Crisped to perfection  not greasy - and they give enough to finish off the queso which is rarely the case.   Also tried the Mexican Chicken Street Tacos.  Chicken chunks a little hefty  but awesome all the same.   Nice  dog-friendly outdoor seating  beware of falling acorns and aggressive birds  and witty signage tops off the whole experience 
Tacodeli,109,Hot damn this place has taken over my dreams. I had the sirloin egg  amp  cheese  and the Cowboy tacos. But best of all was the power combo dip  queso  guacamole  pico  amp  chorizo  REQUEST CHORIZO  You will not regret it except those withdrawal moments when you aren t eating the dip any longer. 
Tacodeli,110,mmmmmmmmmmmm.  The Frontera Fundido is my favorite permanent menu item  and the Seared Scallop taco is my favorite weekly special.  Make sure you go on Wednesday  I think  for the Scallop.  So freaking good   Things are a little odd with the Coronavirus precautions  they don t allow anyone in the restaurant now.  I guess it s for the best until everything passes.    Overall  a standout in the gourmet taco segment.
Tacodeli,111,When I moved to Austin 4 years ago Taco Deli was my first go to taco place for breakfast or lunch. I ordered Taco Deli breakfast tacos  freakin vegan and migas  with chips and queso to go and I was sadly extremely disappointed. The queso was very runny and not the same as it s been in the past. I got both tacos on flour and the tortillas were not soft and different than what they usually use. The migas had too many tortilla strips and very little egg and the freakin vegan was overloaded with beans. I am sad to say I think Tacodeli may be losing their charm. I want to blame it on it being to go but I have picked it up to go plenty of times and this time it was different all around. Not the quality I remember.   
Tacodeli,112,The tacos were delicious  however service was poor. I understand the space is limited  but it felt very cluttered when I was waiting for my order. These tacos were some of the best tacos I ever had in my life so I m going to assume I visited Tacodeli on a bad day.
Tacodeli,113,After a lot of hype and recommendations I decided to try Tacodeli as it is only a half mile from my place.  It seemed promising with the long line out the door and the large crowd eating on their patios  also they have Mexican Coke  so there s a plus.  I ordered a migas taco on corn and a build your own  black beans  avocado and quest fresco  and honestly I ve never waited so long for tacos lol.  Usually tacos are quick to come out at other places  so I thought it was because of the rush. As I was waiting I saw other tacos go out and these tacos looked so sad. I was doubting and doubting as I watched tacos come out...  Then we got our tacos. The migas were not good. The eggs seemed like they were that pre-made egg mix that cafeterias use at colleges or prison. I wouldn t even call the migas here migas. More like very wet eggs and tortillas with no flavor. I got some salsa to flavor it up  but nombre the salsa wasn t EVEN SPICY.  Best part of the whole experience was my coke lol. Also  who doesn t serve refried pinto beans in Texas 
Tacodeli,114,I m a proud Tacodeli addict. Quality ingredients  awesome service  and a bomb location next to the Barton Creek Greenbelt - this is always a stop for me before or after a good hike. I love that they have at least five different vegetarian options - kind of a bummer when I want to eat a vegetarian taco and the joint has like... ONE option.  Don t sleep on the Frontera Fundido Portobello - mushroom lovers rejoice because this one s taking you to flavortown. Parking and seating can be a limited but totes worth the visit. Outside seating available too - just watch out for those birds.
Tacodeli,115,This place is amazing and I so appreciate their curbside pickup  Not to mention the tacos are always fresh and delicious  Thank you for being accommodating and still serving up the best breakfast in Austin 
Tacodeli,116,While I will typically recommend Taco Deli because the tacos are generally good and the staff is always kind  however  I would recommend eating in the restaurant instead of taking out.  You always seem to get screwed at the drive through 
Tacodeli,117,What a great spot  Delicious after a nice Greenbelt hike. The chicken tortilla soup was ok  but the tacos was where it s at  Loved the ground beef taco  Great vibe and customer service   
Tacodeli,118,They have some pretty solid vegan options specifically the Freakin Vegan and Taco Shiitake Tacos. I loved the ambiance and the man working the cash register  spyglass location  was super kind and easy going. He even remembered me the second time I went. I would have given it a 4 since they didn t have Taco Shiitake the second time I arrived and I waited a pretty long time but the service was well done and the guy working the register recognized and greeted me accordingly thus validating that I do exist 
Tacodeli,119,Changing their ingredients was a terrible idea. However the Houston Tacodelis changed over some ingredients like portobello to shiitake mushrooms and their tacos still taste great. Went here and 5 out of the 6 tacos we ordered were terrible- completely flavorless and dripping in nasty oil. Possibly worst tacos I ve ever had. Super disappointed
Tacodeli,120,Last meal on our trip to Austin  and worth it  They have great meat tacos.  THE WAIT  A short line at 11am on the Memorial Day. Our food came out in just a few minutes.  COST  About  20 for all four meat tacos on the lunch menu.  THE FOOD  LUNCH TACOS 4.5 stars - Beef - Cowboy  Dry rubbed beef tenderloin   3.95  4 stars - Beef - Frontera Fundido Sirloin  Grilled sirloin   3.95  3.5 stars - Pork - Puerc  o Verde  Pork shoulder   3.95  3.5 stars - Chicken - Frontera Fundido Chicken  Grilled chicken breast   3.95   See my photos for additional review details 
Tacodeli,121,Lots of choices for eclectic tacos and not your normal meat  onions and cilantro in a corn tortilla taco   Got there around 11am so beat the lunch rush.  This place got packed fast.  They have daily specials if you already didn t have enough choices.   The breakfast tacos sounded good so will probably go back to try those.
Tacodeli,122,Six stars and 2 vegan tacos for  7.04. This is the ultimate taco spot in Austin. Friendly service  great location across from the greenbelt and outdoor seating. There s hope in the world and it s delicious.
Tacodeli,123,WORST Tasting Food Ive EVER HAD  Stay away from this place  UNLESS YOUR A MILLIONAIRE  and don t care about spending money   ordered 4 Taco s   2 CRAPPY CHICKEN and 2 CRAPPY BEEF  and almost Barfed from the CRAPPY MADE food they serve. Speaking about CRAPPY  Their Soda s SUCK TOO   The cola soda tastes like one of those old school Tobacco Shops you used to see in the malls -- smells like     NEVER AGAIN and I DEMAND A REFUND   GEEESH 
Tacodeli,124,What can I say about Tacodeli    Was it good  Yes. I had the carne asada taco.   Was the service quick  Yes.   Was there ample seating clean bathrooms etc.  Yes.   Was it dog friendly  You bet    All this aside  Tacodeli wasn t worth the hype. The food was good  but nothing to write home about. They serve pretty average street tacos  and charge way too much in my opinion.  4.80 for one street taco  aka small taco  is just not reasonable. The charge was probably so high due to the massive chunk of avocado on the taco. I like a good avocado as much as the next person  but it was way too much for the size of the taco. About half of the avocado just fell out while I tried to eat the taco.   Four stars  because Tacodeli strikes me as a place to go for casual  consistent good food. Just don t expect to have your mind blown.   Plus  close proximity to the green belt  Great option for pre or post-hike noms.
Tacodeli,125,Ok  let s be very clear about what this is and what it isn t. This place is a nice take on traditional street tacos  but it s not traditional. It s where white people go to get tacos  which isn t a bad thing   they have a papas taco which had a base of mashed potatoes  actually one of my favorites . This all being said  it is a very solid place to get some fine tacos and hang out on a lazy Sunday morning. I like the Austin locations better than the Dallas locations  and feel like the tortillas in Austin are better. I enjoy the variety of salsas  and the different levels of heat. And  there isn t a taco I ve had that I haven t liked.   Most of these locations get crazy busy  so it s good to prepare for that. The prices are a bit high for what they are  but they aren t bad. They also have some yuppie drinks on their menu  which are enjoyable.
Tacodeli,126,Good mask policy  outdoor dining includes picnic tables outside underneath the trees next to the road  parking isn t enough  at least on Sunday around 1 when we went there since it s across from the hiking trail. The one star taken off was for adding mashed potatoes to a potato egg and bacon breakfast taco  and they burned the bacon. I just came with friends and didn t peruse the menu ahead of time or I would never have gotten the potato added. The bacon may have been over cooked because it was after regular breakfast time. But it was not a good taco. I will go back  but not for breakfast tacos.
Tacodeli,127,Pretty disappointed to see that I can t even order a single taco with a corn tortilla right now as a gluten free human being and craving tacos I can t even eat them here what the actual f ck
Tacodeli,128,Best Breakfast tacos. I get this taco deli for my team at least once a week. My favorite is the Otto on double corn with the mild green salsa.   Even on delivery this taco deli never disappoints. It has the right amount of beans to avocado to bacon ratio sprinkled with cheese verses overly loaded with cheese. The people when I go in an order are also very pleasant and give me incredible recommendations.   10 10   
Tacodeli,129,It seems in the estimation of most  Tacodeli is the rival of Torchys. Ali Foreman to their Ali Foreman etc. Well the lesson this analogy should give you is that both Ali and Foreman were amazing and you don t have to choose  though choose Ali . Your stomach and heart are big enough to love and appreciate both.  Anyways  the breakfast tacos at tacodeli are great. I found the Otto  in particular to be deeply satisfying. The creaminess of the beans and avocado went great with their creamy hot salsa. Get three and then take a nap  It s what I did  granted I d just gotten in on a redeye.
Tacodeli,130,These Tacos are made by Angels and Taste like Heaven. If you want the best tacos of your life then I would encourage you to try 
Tacodeli,131,During my visit to Austin  my friend kept on raving about Tacodeli.   After my first visit  I could see why people are a fan.  I ended up visiting during lunchtime  and the length of the line made me think that this place is quite the popular spot.  The line ended up moving rather quickly  and I ordered three tacos  the Pollo Fantastico  the Tikin Xic  and the Puerco Verde.  I wanted to try a variety of their offerings  so getting one each of their salmon  pork  and chicken tacos seemed like it would provide a good sampling of their menu.  I d never have a salmon taco before  but I was impressed with the Tikin Xic.  It was a bit on the salty side  but the achiote-marinated grilled salmon was quite flavorful.  The Puerco Verde paired tender pork shoulder with a tasty salsa verde  and the Pollo Fantastico delightfully blended shredded chicken with a green chile sauce and crema Mexicana.  They offer several types of hot sauces  with the Do a version being a very spicy standout.  I will definitely check Tacodeli out again when I m in Austin again 
Tacodeli,132,This just happened   On-line order   Pick up.  Asked for extra Salsa...  The Gal working behind the counter says you have 2 in the bag....  I said yes I know can I please get 2 more.    The Gal rolled her eyes as she reached for said Salsa...
Tacodeli,133,More like a 4.5 only because price and sometimes inconsistent with portions.   Amazing tacos and queso    My go to tacos are al pastor and cowboys taco. -al pastor  comes with onions and cilantro. The pork is very meaty and not fatty -Cowboy  delicious tender meat with guacamole  charred corn  and cheese   I like to do a build your own breakfast tacos if I come on the weekend   This is way better than Torchy s Tacos in my opinion. Better ingredients and more flavorful.   Also the workers are amazing 
Tacodeli,134,Y know  I really love this place. Delicious tacos  easily the best in Austin.  But I eat healthy now  and the options are limited. They used to have a fabulous portobello mole taco  which was both tasty AND veggie. But for no good reason they removed it from the menu. The remaining veggie options are pretty bland  and if you want to go vegan  extreeeemly limited. This is Austin and I now expect better.  Also  the salmon is FARM raised. WTAF  For this price I expect at least salmon that isn t going to kill me.  Love you Tacodeli but I just can t eat here any more.
Tacodeli,135,I love tacodeli tacos.   I was once told the owner shuts down at 3pm so his workers could spend more time with their family or doing things that they loved and this made me love tacodeli EVEN more    They have a very extensive menu for picky taco eaters including vegetarian and seafood options   Along with your maybe not-so-typical bfast  chicken  and beef    This is one of the best locations bcuz it is right next to the greenbelt entrance  So you can go for a hike and a taco at the same time   They also are pet friendly on the patio so lots of dogs. A great family place.   Plus the Dona sauce is truly a delight. I buy it buy the pint  Don t judge
Tacodeli,136,Oh yea  so you seeking a real tasty taco check out a tacodeli ....the best beefy and delicious. I ordered the gluten free corn tortilla the Vaquero  my favorite and the carne asada natural grilled ribeye my favorite. Also has cilantro and onion avacado. By now my taste buds are going nuts served with added  rice and beans. The salads are ok I guess there a little warp onions that was served to me and it just was a different taste of wilted onions which was purple. The dressing is homemade serrano lime with yogurt very good and a great choice to serve on an avacado salad. Next was the drinks moon shine tea I recommend it was brewed with peach flavor. The Horchata is served cold and tasts sweet almond and pistachio. This place is usually busy so it can be long lines best time is around 130 if it lunchtime thats people leaving back to work. So I indefinitely loved this place very laid back casual and plain cool.
Tacodeli,137,Split between a 3 and a 4 when I consider the full menu  but I ll give them this. They have 5-star breakfast tacos and salsas  you ve gotta like one of the 4  my favorite is Roja with a bit of Habanero .   I made the mistake of trying quite a few lunch tacos at Tacodelis and they all were pretty bad and cheap tasting. The ingredients just reminded me of precooked meat and premade sauces. Not sure why  but that s just the way they rubbed me. I d never come here for the lunch  but other people like it so whatever. I ve had much better tacos at other  hipster  or Mexican restaurants.  The breakfast tacos  however  ARE something to write home about. The eggs are fantastic  the tortillas are good  the cheese is absolutely delicious  assuming you actually get enough of it. The rest comes down to personal toppings  and I like the classic bacon on my breakfast tacos  but you can get mashed potatoes on the taco and I thought that d be something nice to try. I loved it  my party loved it. More places should have mashed potatoes in their tacos   Church s Chicken has mashed potatoes in their tacos in Puerto Rico  that s what pushed me to try it.   We re staying away from lunch because none of us liked it  but I m open to breakfast any day 
Tacodeli,138,Early Saturday morning family bike ride with breakfast Tacos as the destination.  The 6 miles there was going to make those tacos even more delish   We got here ordered and patiently waited.  10 minutes after the order was supposed to be ready I double checked the order and saw that the order was placed at South Congress    NOOOOOOOO    Called asap and they said just let the spyglass location what happened and they would make our tacos here     Tacodeli saved the day     Hangry kids now happy kids  and parents too  .  All of this awesome customer service made the tacos that much better.  The Dona sauce helped too . Damn good salsa     Cheers Tacodeli    
Tacodeli,139,Tacodeli is good for catering lots of tacos  love this location but I don t feel like the consistency is there. Sometimes amazing  sometimes meh.
Tacodeli,140,In the taco-rich landscape of Austin  this establishment has been my personal favorite. Over one year of interning close to their Barton Skyway location  I d gone through their entire menu  minus the vegetarian ones . But that was 5  years back. Sol it was wonderful to go back after all this time  order the al pastor and then find that nothing has changed. The pork is still just as tender  just as juicy  the spices are all perfect and corn tortilla is still the best tortilla for tacos.   My favorite taco place. Anywhere.   Also had the tacoloco - it s smoked brisket. Do you need any other info  The fish tacos  mojo fish taco in particular and the mojo sauce  Oh man  it s so good 
Tacodeli,141,Extremely crowded place. Hyped. People purchasing  12.00 tanks and shirts as if it s Black Friday.   I ve tried this place plenty of times before. Took a long break from it  about 1 year  and now tried it again on Friday. The tacos are good  sure but there are soooo many other great  local  fresh  smaller places that Austin offers  Papalotes  Velvet Tacos  Torchy s  Kesos  Maria s Tacos  El Tacorrido  Veracruz Tacos etc. . Addicted to the Jalapeno Cr me or Habenaro sauce  Every one that I just listed does the same. The portions of the tacos are small but are creative I agree. Sweet Potato Tacos  Charred Grilled Queso Steak. I m not a fan of crowdiness. It was a battle to find parking. You would be battling with Green Belters  compact cars only parking lot or the employees that are around the office park area.   I can recommend so many other places that outperform even. Simply for me  cons outweigh the pros. God speed if you wish you continue to go if you want Snapchat your trendiness.
Tacodeli,142,Great tacos  I found this place based off the reviews and it held up to the hype  Also  we loved the refried black beans and rice  Definitely a great stop.
Tacodeli,143,This spot is our go to at least 2 or 3 times a week  Always good food and service. I am so grateful for my Tacodeli.
Tacodeli,144,Hey guys I noticed you all are wearing gloves delivering food customers and I don t know if you are changing them between every customer otherwise you re doing nothing but spreading germs with those gloves..... It s called cross-contamination...... Ditch the gloves and use hand sanitizer after everything your employees touch in between every customer.... Google it you ll learn a lot....
Tacodeli,145,Eh  honestly I wasn t very impressed by Tacodeli. As a first timer in Austin I had high hopes for my first breakfast tacos but at the same time  I didn t really know what to expect. I had been told that people are either a Tacodeli person or a Torchy s person  and unfortunately  we never were hungry enough between meals for Torchy s to compare.  We came here in the morning before walking the Greenbelt train and up the river so I was looking to fill up for the rest of the morning and early afternoon  which is definitely succeeded in. There was no wait when we arrived so we had time to chat it up and get recommendations on the breakfast menu.  I decided upon 3 tacos  -The Otto on corn -El Popeye on wheat -Classic Migas on flour  Nothing was special about the ingredients nor combinations so I was pretty underwhelmed. We did also order a small side of queso and guacamole  but there was some miscommunication in the order I guess and they were forgotten as well as the second one of my friend s tacos. Fortunately  because it wasn t that busy we were able to reconcile it fairly speedily. The queso was probably the best part and was way better than the guacamole which was too acidic for our liking.  When I come back to Austin I ll definitely be trying out what Torchy s has to offer and only after that will I possibly return to Tacodeli to try the non-breakfast menu to compare.
Tacodeli,146,This location is my original introduction to Taco Deli and I think is the best of all the locations - call me sentimental.  I still remember when it was the only location and they had habanero pico de gallo off the menu.  Yum.    Anyhow - love the tacos and the sauces  I can drink the Roja like it s soup  .  Walk your dog  hit the trails and then come up for a taco and a cool beverage.  Delish.
Tacodeli,147,Omggg best tacos ever taste like the tacos you get from Mexico  I love the el pastor and cowboy 
Tacodeli,148,Just had a family style soft taco meal.  Steak and chicken were really tasty and cooked just right.  Black beans had great flavor.  Staff was super friendly and really went out of their way to take care of us.  I highly recommend this place.
Tacodeli,149,I first encountered Tacodeli at a farmer s market.  They were great so why not try the original store.  The store is located next to the Greenbelt.  It is counter service with no frills. There is both indoor and outdoor seating.  Pets can sit outside.  There is wide selection of tacos as you would expect given its name.    I had the shrimposito  the mojo fish  and the Tikin Xic.  All three were nice and fresh on a corn tortilla.  I did not care for the salmon rub on the Tikin Xic.   The shrimp taco was great as was the mojo fish.   All in all  these are some pretty great tacos.  Probably my favorite in Austin.
Tacodeli,150,Did an online order for curbside pickup at 7300 Burnet.  No one came to deliver the order.  My wife tried calling the store  but no answer.  After 20 minutes  she walked in to pick it up.  They had no problem taking our money  but had a real problem giving us the food.
Tacodeli,151,Oh my GOD  Best tacos in Austin  in Texas  and possibly the entire nation.  To truly grasp the deliciousness of this place - go with a group and order as many tacos as possible then share   I got to try five of them and they all had their own unique goodness but my favorites were the Deli Belly  only on Saturdays  and the El Picosito   But the El Conquistador  the Cowboy  and  the Sirloin en Mole were pretty bad ass as well   AND they have yummy salsitas too 
Tacodeli,152,I never thought I d do this. Tacodeli is an institution  and when I lived here it was an anchor of the Austin-style. It s still beautiful inside and their salsa is still a delight. Hell  it s the basis of my fave restaurant in my adopted home.   Time moves on  though. It s just good these days.
Tacodeli,153,delicioso. long lines  but good tacos. comparable to other smaller taco joints around town
Tacodeli,154,If you aren t using mashed potatoes for your breakfast tacos  you re doing it wrong.  And this place pioneered that fact check .  I would rate Tacodeli the best breakfast tacos in the world.  Central TX owns this category and I really haven t found another place that s 3 4 as good.  I get a lot of argument on that  but I think y all crazy.  Lunch dinner tacos are rock solid as well.
Tacodeli,155,Taco Deli vs. Torchy s Tacos.  Austin is a taco town and there are many options.  But these two are Austin s iconic local chains.  Each has its merits and I frequent both....often.  For me  it comes down to this     Both places have great tasting and interesting tacos.  The best tasting tacos are at Taco Deli.  Mole tacos  the Mexico City  Al Pastor and Akaushi Picadillo are some of my favorites.  And yay for Scallop Taco Thursdays  The fact that they use locally sourced  Heartbrand Ranch  Lightsey Farms  Oak Hill Farms  Pedernales Valley Farms....just to name a few  and organic ingredients makes a taste difference.  Taco Deli WINS      Taco Deli s menu is bigger and they have a daily taco special.  VS  Torchy s menu is smaller and they have a monthly taco special.  Taco Deli WINS   I can t help feeling the hit in my wallet every trip to Taco Deli.  An average of nearly  4 a modest sized taco  although some tacos are more substantial than others  i.e. the meaty pork Chile Relleno vs. the lightly filled Akaushi Picadillo .  I don t need a ton to fill me up but 2 of these tacos usually doesn t do the trick  so an  8 bill that might leave me hungry  since I m not a fan of rice beans combo plates .  Torchy s tacos are much more fat  they are stuffed so many ingredients sometimes the double tortilla can t hold it all together.  TORCHY S WINS   Salsa.  Salsa is secondarily important only to tacos.  Taco Deli features a salsa bar and has several options and it s fun to try a variety of them.  Torchy s adds sauces to some of their tacos vs. the salsa bar idea  and you can substitute upon request.  But when I just want a side of chips and salsa  hands down my go-to is Torchy s Tomatillo salsa.  TORCHY S WINS   Branding  Torchy s  damn fine tacos  and the little devil dude is cool  and memorable.  It s also cleverly embedded in some locations as unique works of art  check out the ceramic mosaic and the 1st Street location .  The Tacodeli Mexican dude is kind of small  not used predominantly and not so memorable.  TORCHY S WINS   Hours   why  why  why does Taco Deli close so early   Boo.  TORCHY S WINS  by default    Atmosphere  both offer dog-friendly patio seating at most locations. Taco Deli s Spyglass location and Torchy s 1st Street location are my favorite  Austin Cool  spots.  TIE.
Tacodeli,156,Coming from someone whose obsessed with tacos--as in  breakfast taco  is my first thought of every morning  I have HIGH expectations.  Here s why to go to Taco Deli  1. Sirloin  egg  amp  cheese with Dona sauce 2. Cowboy  SIRLOIN- that meat is gooood. It s easy-peasy to scramble up some eggs  slap some cheese on top and make a taco. But the tender meat with that great smokey flavor gets me out of the house. Dona sauce is a great complement to the egg  amp  cheese.   COWBOY- Only lunch taco I have found to be worth getting. Again with that meat... and then throw on some good ol  guac and add a kick of jalapenos  and you have yourself a taco    I ve been told Deli Belly is worth becoming a regular  so I ll give it a shot. Other than that  honestly don t waste your time  exploring the whole menu.  I did that for years and it s a waste.   Taco Deli gets a CRAZY amount of HYPE  and some  signature  items are weird...in a bad way. Warning  DO NOT GET THE POTATOES. They are mashed  aka mushy  and just not right for a breakfast taco.
Tacodeli,157,Great breakfast tacos. My wife and I came on a Saturday at 11  luckily on the weekends they serve breakfast tacos all day  on weekdays only until 11 . It was packed but we were able to find a seat. Friendly and helpful staff.  I got the Otto and bacon  egg and cheese which were both delicious and they have good salsa  I especially like the hot green one. My wife loved the migas and the Jess so much that she got another one at the airport when we were leaving.  This is definitely a place to stop by when I m Austin 
Tacodeli,158,The blue plate is what makes taco deli different from torchys  I m a side person all day  having an option that comes with sides is my jam 
Tacodeli,159,Pros  friendliness  run smoothly  food is DELICIOUS. Cowboy  al pastor  ALL the salsas  queso all killer Cons  This is austin and I live in Michigan.  -   As a tourist I m doing my research and plotting my course if action.  Yelp tells me how awesome this place is and notice I can put stop off my greenbelt hike.  After sweating my bees off on the hike I walk up this little hill and the gates of heaven open to taco deli.   As I walk in several people cheer for my state of Michigan shirt... the workers all start making small talk about Michigan and several were from there too.  Bill took my order and was beyond friendly and accommodating.  It was really cool seeing them treat random customers this way.  Their enthusiasm for their patrons is matched for their enthusiasm for the food.  The queso was delicious.  Very similar to beer cheese and compliments those chips perfectly.  Each salsa was a homerun.  I preferred the habanero.  They nailed that fruity sweetness of the pepper without killing you with the heat.  I m sure many people would say too hot but if you are the kind of person who likes hot sauce you ll be able to crush it.  The cowboy taco had layers of flavor.  Bill warned me not to throw salsa on it before trying it... my wife does the same thing but I received his recommendation a lot nicer than I do my wife s.  He was right.  A good taco needs each component to really contribute to the overall flavor and I wouldn t change a thing about this.  When he wasn t watching I still threw salsa on it in the end.  I have no restraint.  The al pastor was also delicious.  Bill came over to make sure I enjoyed my meal and not in as n annoying chain restaurant way.  He was sincere and proud.  I m only here a few more days.  I m going to try and get back here.  If not  I may have to plan a return visit    - 
Tacodeli,160,Rags and I stopped for brunch here on a Sunday. Having heard about the famed Torchy s vs Tacodeli debate  we really wanted to experience at least one place during our stay. We were definitely not disappointed. This location is sort of hipster cool  with quirky tables and nice bright interior. Plenty of seating outside  and they are pet friendly on the patio. I think we got lucky - the wait was about 5 - 7 min only  for ordering our food. We ordered 5 tacos  medium salsa tub and chips  all under  25.00  yes   For the food  here is the lowdown - - The Jess - My fav taco  the avocado definitely made it. The avos were so fresh and perfectly ripe  eggs were well scrambled too - Veraquez - Rags picked this one. The charred pepper relish thing on top totally made the taco amazing  - Chicken Mole - delish - Sweet Potato - The sweet potatoes themselves were SO well cooked  I could have had a bowl of that by myself. I am not sure if they lend themselves well to a taco as a vessel. The whole things lacks texture and becomes mushy - Mojo Fish - Delicious as well. The fish was a tad bit overcooked  but the salsa verde on top and the sauce was delicious.   We waited about 15 min for our food  but honestly to goodness  we devoured 4 bags of chips with the medium salsa in between  lol  They kept offering more chips and we shamelessly kept saying yes - hah   Will I be back - for sure  Their breakfast tacos are definitely the bomb 
Tacodeli,161,I had quite a feast of delicious tacos here for a dirt cheap price.  Reading about the popularity and potential crowds here  I thought I would be slick and take advantage of the call ahead for pickup that they offer. Unless it s really a peak time though  I would advise against this  as the tacos lose something when they re wrapped up and squished in tin foil.  Nevertheless  everything was still quite tasty. We had a total of 6 delicious tacos   - Blue Plate Special   8.50  Cowboy Taco  beef tenderloin with grilled corn  caramelized onions  roasted peppers  guacamole and queso fresco  and Mojo Fish Taco  with rice and beans on the side. - The Sirloin  Egg  amp  Cheese Taco   3.20  - The Otto Taco   3  Refried black beans  bacon  avocado and Monterrey Jack cheese - Banh Mi Taco   4  - Mole Pork Taco   4   The standout for me was definitely the special of the day  the Banh Mi Taco  which really did taste like a Vietnamese sandwich in taco form. The Cowboy was also excellent.  The place is pretty small  with just a few tables inside  but several more on the nice patio outside. All the employees were very friendly and helpful in clearing tables after lazy people were finished eating and left all their trash. I would definitely like to try some of the other locations  and just order as I get there to enjoy the food fresh.
Tacodeli,162,Taco deli  generally speaking  is my go-to breakfast or lunch place when I m in Austin.  Let me start out by saying that I think the Burnet location tacos are better  but this location is still solid overall.    This is the southern most location so if I m staying downtown or around the airport  this is your location.  Tacos are great although I thought they gave a bit too much meat and toppings  I know  I know.  I shouldn t complain .  The freshness  taste  and quality are always fantastic.  Couple that with Dona sauce  and you have the best tacos in all the land.    Great  im hungry again...
Tacodeli,163,This is my neighborhood taco joint. They definitely add their own personality to traditional dishes like Cochinita Pibl tacos or Pork Belly tacos. They get 4 stars because they only use mashed potatoes. I can t get down with mushy mashed potatoes in my taco.
Tacodeli,164,You can t beat the tortillas from Tacodeli  they are simply the best. Their Fundido taco is my favorite. I order mine with chicken on a corn tortilla  but there are other protein options. Their Salsa Do a is actually spicy and flavorful. If you don t do spicy  try the salsa verde. A taco without salsa is an unfinished masterpiece. If you are vegetarian  try the Papadulce taco or The Heather. For breakfast  I like The Freakin  Vegan.
Tacodeli,165,I used to be the biggest fan of Tacodeli until their quality started a downhill spiral. Today was my last visit and it pains me to say that. I ordered my usual bean and papas on flour and from the looks of it  I think whomever prepared our order was given a teaspoon to slop fillings on a tortilla. Pee-poor quality 
Tacodeli,166,First visit.  Just great breakfast tacos.  Fresh and tasty.   Eggs  portobello  black beans  chicken  alvacado.  Side of cheese. On corn.  We re amazing.    Will be back many more times.    Staff seemed to be having a good time and all had a smile   
Tacodeli,167,My go-to place for tacos when I am in town. Their salmon tikin xic is probably one of my favorite tacos I have ever had. Anywhere. And that s saying a lot.  Just know what you re getting into when you head to this location. It s small  and BUSY. Be prepared to wait for your food for awhile. My last trip down  May June 2018   I went on the day I arrived. Early afternoon on a Saturday. The wait for my food was 35 minutes. Lucky me  I stay literally down the street so I went back into the A C and chilled until it was time.  Their food is killer. Even the breakfast tacos.
Tacodeli,168,I live right next to Tacodeli and I still haven t gotten tired of it. Their tacos are the BEST tacos I ve ever had. More specifically  the Tickin Xic  salmon  taco is the best taco I will ever have. It s super underrated  but it s flavor is insane. Every time I make my friends get it  they add it to their taco rotation. I m still amazed that I ve probably ordered TD over 50 times and they ve never messed up an order. It s also convenient that you can order over the phone  online or in person. To say they run a very tight ship would be an understatement.   The reviews saying that the staff is grouchy or unpleasant has never been true for me. And if it is  I wouldn t knock off a star because a worker didn t smile at me. That s not why I m there.   Anyways  go to Taco Deli if you want to have a great start to the day.
Tacodeli,169,Best taco joint. Period. Great prices  always fresh  many creative choices  Although it tends to get packed  the service is fast and convenient.  My favorite is carne asada but there is a lot to choose from.
Tacodeli,170,This was one of my fav breakfast taco spots during college and became one of my fav lunch taco spots while working for the law firm.  This unassuming store front may have limited space  but the tacos they serve up knock it out of the park  Among my favs tacos are The Heather  Freakin  Vegan  Happy Taco  back when I was a meat eater   Jess Special  The Vaquero  and then pretty much any breakfast taco with their mashed potatoes.  As strange as that sounds  trust me  it is amazing.  Speaking of amazing  Salsa Dona.  Get it.  It will burn you  but the burn is so good.  I cover everything in the stuff.  And in advance  you re welcome.    Even at super busy  peak times  they move the line quite quickly.  Best thing to do if you re in a time crunch  call ahead and they will have it ready for you when you get there.  Then have a seat outside  enjoy the shady beautiful atmosphere  and get ready to be transported to taco heaven.  Now I need to get some Taco Deli in my Beli....mmmmm.
Tacodeli,171,I visited Tacodeli around 1pm on a Friday to grab lunch. It seems like this location is incredibly popular  especially around lunch  because the parking lot  street parking  patio  and indoor seating were almost to capacity.  Service  very good. Everyone was genuinely happy to be working there  even during peak business time  and I saw smiles all around. There seemed to be quite a backlog of orders  as I had to wait around 20 minutes for my two lunch tacos  the ordering line moved very quickly  though   but they were cranking them out as fast as possible. Though the wait was long  the wait  between  orders was quite short  perhaps 1-2 minutes  which makes for speedy service. Again  smiles and friendly check-ups from the waiters really lifted my experience.  Locale  The interior is very small  with a few tables  some tall stools  and a lot more outdoor and patio seating. Be prepared to sit outside in the heat if you visit during peak hours.  Food  I ordered the Cowboy and the Tacoloco with corn tortillas. The Cowboy came with huge chunks of beef tenderloin  sweet and savory grilled corn  and fresh and flavorful onion  pepper  queso  and guacamole. The only slight issue I had with this taco is that a few pieces of the meat seemed a bit dry. Other than that  the flavor and portion size was excellent. The Tacoloco was incredible. A mountain of juicy brisket with all the toppings you could ask for  which made for an amazing taco. The mushrooms and onion really added to the flavor. The only additional thing I will say  as mentioned in other reviews  is that the guacamole isn t anything terribly special. It s good  just not spectacular   Overall  Almost nothing to complain about. Great tacos for a great price. Excellent service. 4 5 stars.
Tacodeli,172,Fantastic tacos with great quality meat and a spicy salsa bar. Also  it s a bustling location but the food comes out very quickly. The Cowboy was great and so was the breakfast sirloin egg  amp  cheese  which was a surprise 
Tacodeli,173,I am a huge fan of Tacodeli  This chain needs to go national. Awesome meat and tacos and I don t even like tacos that much.
Tacodeli,174,I am an Otto and do a addict. Their papadulce taco is on-point too.   Anytime I visit this place  the service is great  and the tacos always deliver.   The folks who work here are warm and kind  usually asking how my day is or what I have in store for the day. One time  it was the day my fiance and I were going wedding ring shopping  and the cashier remembered  and when he dropped off our tacos  he said   Congrats   Sweet  kind things like that go a long way  and the service is consistently great.  It s an Austin staple  Get a taco after your run on the Greenbelt  Ingredients for a perfect day in Austin.
Tacodeli,175,Believe the hype  kids. T-del is the real deal. You can end your search and fire up your blogs because this is the best breakfast taco in town.  I popped in here on an unusually gorgeous 80  day in January after walking all over the boardwalk by Lady Bird Lake. I was OD ing on endorphins and thought  Tacos. DUH    Because it was Sunday  breakfast tacos were served all day. On weekdays they stop at 11 a.m. so keep that in mind. On the rec of the cashier I went with the Otto and a Vaquero on flour torts. Solid all around. The tortillas were sturdy  with a little fluff  and cradled all ingredients like Barry Sanders cradled footballs into end zones.   The Otto had crisp bacon  fresh cheese   cado  and a refried bean paste that rounded everything out. Completely hit the spot. The Vaquero was a Goddamn Coachella rave tent in my mouth. Loved it. Crisp corn  fluffy eggs  sweet roasted peppers  same Jack cheese. Insane. Loved every bite and I never felt more like an Austinite than when I finished off each taco with their delicious selection of salsas.  Their dona is their call to fame and I can see why. It s fiery and green and smooth and if you listen closely you can hear it say  I love you .   I know I write long reviews sometimes  so if you re looking up this joint on Yelp because you can t decide lemme help you out   EAT AT TACODELI.
Tacodeli,176,This being the only place close to my office for lunch  there is a mixture of joy  amp  panic at the news that this location will be closed in early May for much needed renovations  including moving into the space next door to have more seating.   Apparently there will be a truck outside  amp  catering orders will be filled via the Westlake location.   Our notification didn t indicate a reopening. Knowing City of Austin  it could be a while. Looks like a lot of us will be packing our lunches now.
Tacodeli,177,My favorite tacos in Austin  .   So good  great prices  amp  great service.  I love the outside seating too  nice atmosphere
Tacodeli,178,The best. Clean and bright. Happy and smiley staff. The best inventive tacos ever. Try the Otto 
Tacodeli,179,Will Beth D. agree with this review as she does some ninja spying on the hill while mooning the brainwashed taco walkers as they place an order  Probably.. but we cant say for sure.  What I can say for sure is that Tacodeli offers a decent taco at a higher price than the norm. Is it bad  no... is it great  certainly not. But  what it lacks in quality quantity it makes up for in customer service  those people up front seriously have some great customer service going on  always attentive and accommodating when I have been.   The tacos are on the small side  and the quantity of ingredients can be lacking at times. The sauces  mainly the habanero one.. sure does have some kick to it. Set-up inside is a little crowded if you are trying to order and then turn a few inches sideways and pour yourself a cup of coffee. Nice outside seating  great if you want to relax with your dog and scarf down a quick taco.
Tacodeli,180,Catering and food to go is awesome   Shows up on time and is delicious   We have used them for a few parties and they bring everything. Hot and ready  5 stars   
Tacodeli,181,This is my neighborhood taco place. I m here a few days a week. The tacos I love are the Freakin  Vegan and the Portobello Fundido Fronterra. Most of the items here are spicy  so it s hard to find tacos that are mild. Those two are. Definitely don t get the guacamole if you don t like spicy stuff. The employees here are unbelievably nice. It s great to sit outside.
Tacodeli,182,I got three different breakfast tacos for lunch. Each one was delicious and really hit the spot. I got them on tortilla. My only regret is not having more opportunities to return so I can try everything on the menu.   This location is pretty small - not a lot of seating.
Tacodeli,183,The vegan options are bad. The mushrooms inside the mushroom tacos are just a blob of soggy mess. Really gross. You need to crisp up the mushrooms and get the water out of it so it s not a pile of disgusting. The rice is not vegan.
Tacodeli,184,Incredibly friendly service combined with a huge selection of tacos and incredible hot sauce..what s not to like.
Tacodeli,185,Had lunch today. Food and service was outstanding. Nice atmosphere. Great flavor parking was easy
Tacodeli,186,I kinda slammed Tacodeli s airport location  so it s important that I leave this review  too...  I LOVE  LOVE  LOVE Tacodeli. This is what Austin tacos are all about. My favorites are the Fundido Sirloin and the Freakin  Vegan. And Tacodeli has some of the best coffee in town. The place is packed on Saturday mornings. Be patient - it s worth it.
Tacodeli,187,I used to love tacodeli  Their food is really good and they have some creative tacos but it s pretty overpriced. My favorite breakfast taco is the Otto and with taxes it comes out to about  4. This morning I was disappointed to see how tiny the tacos are becoming. They are starting to become too stingy and yet the prices are still going up. If it weren t for the convenience since it s down the street from my work  then I would probably wouldn t return.
Tacodeli,188,This place is delicious    And friendly.  And prompt.  The menu is huge.  They have COFFEE    I would come to Austin just to eat these.
Tacodeli,189,This place is dang good. In a town of store bought tortillas and flavors gone wrong  Tacodeli gets it right. Living in mini Mexico  San Antonio  had given me expert knowledge of what makes a Btaco so delicious. It s all in the tortilla.  do you hear me torchy s lame breakfast tacos     thin flour and it doesn t over power the tacos. No one wants a taco where all you taste is the Tort. You want a delicate balance of the fresh ingredients on the inside  with a soft tort to melt in your mouth.   I ve never been here for dinner or lunch.. But for me  if it compares to what they do with breakfast  then I m a fan and a half. I won t even list what I had.. Cause I m sure everything you get will be amazeballs. Skip torchy s and only use them for queso cravings. Come here for tacos.
Tacodeli,190,I want to give them 5 stars so badly  because in general their tacos are fantastic. Solid breakfast tacos  excellent lunch tacos and specials  frontera sirloin  pork belly  pipian rojo  tikin xic  and vegetarian options  papadulce .   But I can t give them 5 stars  because  1  Their  guacamole  is nightmarishly bad. The  gwock  as we ll call it  after the noise you ll make when your body rejects it  is a thin  salty  hyper-citrusy biological weapon devoid of avocado that ruins several of their otherwise good tacos. It s baffling to see a few reviews praising it  the consensus among everybody I know is that it s a horrible anomaly on the menu. 2  Most of the team is awesome  fast and friendly  but they ve had a couple long-term employees that straight up suck. Have you ever had somebody so resentful of their job that they stare into middle space 12 inches over your head when they mumble-ask for your order    I recommend it  just avoid a couple of the soul-sucking employees and the battery acid they call guacamole.
Tacodeli,191,LIMITED MENU -- this location is only offering a few taco options  served from their truck out front while the building is under construction.  I couldn t get the veg taco I wanted     But the staff was quick and helpful       Everything is packed  to-go  from the truck. There s still picnic tables outside for seating.
Tacodeli,192,I ve finally had Taco Deli for lunch. I know there are many taco places to choose from and everyone has their preferences and go tos. I have to say living in San Antonio for 6 years it s hard for me to compare these Austin taco places. This place is legit. I can understand why people rave about it. Honestly you have to really screw up royally for me to not like your taco.   One day I was being indecisive for lunch so I just got in my car and drove. I knew this place was round the corner from the office. It was peak lunch time and there was a line out the door. I waited in line a bit and then had to wait for food. The wait really wasn t that bad. It was was busy time so it was expected. I got back to the office and couldn t wait to dig in. I go the following   Frontera Fundido Sirloin - Grilled sirloin  jack cheese glaze  saut ed poblano-onion rajas Their beef is so good and tender. Great flavor too. All the accouterments are great. These are simple but delicious tacos.  Shrimp Taco - Grilled Texas Gulf shrimp  jack cheese glaze  saut ed poblano-onion rajas This was pretty much the same as my beef taco but with shrimp. Again delicious  I love the poblano-onion rajas on both of these.   My favorite Taco Deli salsa is the Salsa Dona. It s the green one. Don t be fooled it looks creamy but it s not. I would describe it as a smooth  spicy salsa. PS If you re a huge fan of their salsa s they sell them at Whole Foods.   I have not been disappointed by Taco Deli. Every other Friday at work we get tacos from them. I try and mix it up and just pick something out of whatever bag and they re all delicious. Great quality and decent service.
Tacodeli,193,This is just going to bolster Tacodeli s already high star average. Our breakfast experience was incredible. We had a nice selection of tacos -- mine were the Jess special and the Frontera Fundido with sirloin -- and chips and queso  because  why not   The food was fantastic  and the service was great. I only wish this place had locations in Michigan 
Tacodeli,194,The best vegan tacos around  1  Freakin  Vegan  and 2  Space Cowboy  hold the queso . Get  em on corn tortillas  and they re GF. Add chips and Do a salsa  and suddenly you re in your happy place...at the picnic tables...under the trees...with your taco lovin  friends. Birds singing. Breeze blowing. It s the best.
Tacodeli,195,COVID safe. They beyond caring for customers. It was nice to get out and eat tacos. Mmmm lol. The weather was gorgeous. Friendly helpful staff. Tacos were great
Tacodeli,196,I had the short rib  lunch special  and the happy taco... both so good  Just be prepared to wait or call ahead to beat the line. I always make a stop here when I m in town.
Tacodeli,197,Tacodeli is the Goldilocks of tacos. Not too big or salty  Torchy s  J accuse   nor too small or bland. They re just right. My favorite tacos in Austin.  I am particularly found of their breakfast tacos. The Otto shows that Tacodeli gets beans - they re so good  And of course  I recommend the Jess Special. Migas plus  as I refer to it.  Of all the locations  this one is my favorite. It still feels like the sleepy  old Austin I grew up with. The staff is super friendly  freely chatting with customers  and it has a very laid-back vibe. Plus the patio seating has plenty of coverage for those hot summer days.
Tacodeli,198,I d never heard of Tacodeli before I visited. It was mentioned in an article about a hike I planned on doing  so I figured it was worth a shot since it was nearby. Luckily  we arrived moments before it got insanely crowded.   Perhaps if I had been somewhat familiar with the menu I would ve made a better choice  however I enjoyed my taco  the Heather  and the guac VERY much. My first thought was literally  Torchy s could NEVER   I ve never really understood the hype of that place.  Because of the high volume of customers  this place was slightly chaotic. They should either expand or come up with a better system for distributing food. I m normally not bothered by crowds  but in this case it took away from the experience. Other than that  everything was awesome. Luckily  a Tacodeli just opened in Houston this year so I ll be able to explore the menu more.
Tacodeli,199,Thank you tacodeli for giving me a shot of milk when i was dying from the spice. Be weary of hidden pepper seeds in their tacos.  Huge selection of tacos at a decent price.
Tacodeli,200,The happy taco is where it s at    The salsas are amazing and the black bean and cheese is always good 
Tacodeli,201,Never disappoints   This is by far my favorite breakfast taco in Austin. From the steak  egg  and cheese  I add avocado  to the Popeye  you just can t hide the high quality  organic  sustainable  local  ingredients that make such a simple food taste so good.   This place also embodies all that is in Austin - located off the beaten path  near the entrance the greenbelt  the rustic feel gives it quite a bit of charm.
Tacodeli,202,Their  Picosito  taco is not as described.  It says  grilled tenderloin   it should say  grilled ground beef .  If it had  I would not have ordered it.   They took forever to make it and when I finally got it  it was cold.  I had to re-heat it.  It is very frustrating to try something new and have it be so lacking.
Tacodeli,203,For the 1st time husband made a suggestion on where to go eat   This may seem small  but since becoming a Yelper  I ve suddenly become an instant food directory  but I digress....  Happy to finally see my husband put in a little effort  I obliged to his request for Tacodeli.  So  1  parking isn t great.  Be prepared to maneuver a bit.  We got lucky and pulled up just as another car pulled out  but I could see that others had to park down the street and walk.  And really  I m sure that walking wouldn t be that big of a deal in this neighborhood as it s right next to the Green Belt Hiking trail.  80  of their seating is on the patio and although the sun was out today  it was nice that the gas heat lamps were out.  The wait was maybe 10 minutes to order and then another 15 minutes to actually get our order.  Considering we came during the lunch rush I won t really complain about waiting.  My husband ordered 2 rock fish tacos and 1 cowboy.  I tried the Migas Royale and shrimp taco.  All good food.  Even the mashed potatoes weren t that bad  but honestly  I felt like my plate went on a Weight Watchers diet.  There was clearly no pork involved in any of that dish.  A little  yuppied-up  if you ask me.  What can I say  I like my migas very traditional.  I gave it a try  but wouldn t go back for seconds.  Maybe for the shrimp  but not the migas.  Just personal preference I suppose.
Tacodeli,204,BREAKFAST TACOS ARE THE WAY TO MY HEART AND STOMACH  LOL  I love a good ole classic and simple breakfast tacos. The fillings are always on point. The different flavor of salsas each had a WOW factor that made me want to dip each bit of my taco in.  I ordered the the migas and vaquero tacos and lets just say I was a happy camper  I added avocados to the vaquero and bacon the migas tacos. As you can see I love an explosion of flavor in everything I eat. The avocados gave it the creamy factor while the bacon made for a subtle but perfect salty component.  The perfect way to start my day and drive back to Houston 
Tacodeli,205,Unfortunately this place food did not live up to the hype. The best part of dining here was not the tacos but the chips and the queso. Unfortunately the menu was overpriced and I can get much better items that taste much better nearby that are also much more authentic. Will not be returning. With that being said the staff was incredibly helpful.
Tacodeli,206,Why why WHY do you stop serving breakfast tacos at 11am   You are most known for your breakfast tacos  That s what you do best  This is Austin  We eat breakfast tacos ALL DAY LONG.   I wouldn t be bitching but you are a favorite breakfast taco for me and I get soooooo annoyed that you stop serving them at 11am  What the heck   And what s with the mashed potatoes   I love the Vaquero.... but sometimes I want a potato  egg and cheese. Not a mashed potato  egg and cheese 
Tacodeli,207,Had Cowboy Taco .. I question meat as stated on menu as beef tenderloin   I never had a chewy bite of any tenderloin  Truth on menu  
Tacodeli,208,Aways consistently awesome  Incredible food  great prices and very very friendly staff  Our regular go to place for great casual food 
Tacodeli,209,Papa dulce and the vaquero are definitely worth a try  There is also an entrance to hike right across this taco deli so it s a great place to grab some food before or after a hike.
Tacodeli,210,I visited Taco Deli earlier this month for the first time since December when I moved out of state. I was so happy to be back  I love this restaurant and the food is always amazing. But I am really writing this review to give a shout out to their new employee  Michelle. She is an absolute delight  We first met her on her first day at work  or her first day on the cash register  and we loved  loved  loved her personality. On our second visit she wasn t at the register and I was disappointed. But then she happened to deliver our order to the table. She remembered my name and she remembered my daughter had a food allergy. We had a really nice chat with her again. She definitely fits in with the wonderful Taco Deli vibe. Whoever hired her did a fantastic job 
Tacodeli,211,Cannot recommend this place enough   Wish they always had their habanero salsa available. Service is pretty fast considering how busy this place always is.
Tacodeli,212,I usually visit this restaurant for lunch. it is always packed with customers. The Tacos are delicious and I especially like the flavor which seems unique to Tacodeli. They have a nice outdoor area to dine when the weather is good.  Good food  good neighborhood  good service.
Tacodeli,213,The tacos here are average at best. Honestly  you can find better breakfast tacos at other local spots around Austin like Texas Honey Ham. Someone told me to order the otto since it s apparently one of their signature tacos and while it was decent  the baby diaper consistency was a huge turn off. Seriously though. It s essentially just refried beans avocado and one strip of bacon which makes for an extremely mushy taco.   I would go here again but it wouldn t be my first option.
Tacodeli,214,Food tastes good but overpriced for what you get.  Been there a few times for pick-up during COVID but have found the staff to not be friendly and dismissive.  Not a good experience.
Tacodeli,215,It s been said throughout history that you either die a hero or either love long enough to become a villain. I ve dined at taco deli for 192 days 5 hours 22 minutes and 18 seconds and up until that point they were my hero.   Their breakfast tacos... elegant  flavorful  and made me a better person in the morning. Whether it was the delight of the Otto or the consistent crunch of the bacon in the bacon and egg breakfast taco. I loved them.  I often venture to tack deli for lunch too. I found that their lunch tacos  while not as good as their breakfast taco  were enjoyable. But today I discovered their metaphorical child of their Catholic Church closet. That taco  the one that changed everything was the El Picosito. Crafted by satan himself and his demon angels.The El Picosito masquerades as a tasty taco that will enchant your tastebuds but instead  just like the satanic snake in the garden at the creation of time  it fools you into living a life of despair.   It tastes like shit. It makes you feel like shit. I found myself finishing the whole taco because it made me feel as though I deserved to feel like shit. It changed my perspective of myself. I will now be eating it for every meal because I now do not believe I deserve better. Save yourself for this hell. Don t buy the El Picosito.
Tacodeli,216,Tacodeli is packed and had a line in the middle of the afternoon.  After waiting about twenty minutes  I was able to get their tacos and tried one beef  chicken  and pork taco.  Each of them were flavorful and really good tacos.  In the end  it s worth the wait.
Tacodeli,217,We came here after a swim at the greenbelt. It was a little pricey  but the quality was good. They had some good flavors of kombucha  I got tangerine   Their salsas were probably the best part of the meal- definitely try each one. The habanero was quite tasty and not as spicy as they made it seem 
Tacodeli,218,Delicious. Fresh  healthy  options galore. Filled me up with out making me tired. I just can t say enough good things.
Tacodeli,219,Came here on Monday  because  on Monday s we go to Austin.  My friends and I went here before we went hiking on green belt  I just wanted some tacos  and this place just happened to be near by. We arrived 30 minutes before closing time because  no we are not those type of customers lol  we didn t realize  correction I   they closed at 3. Mind you  I m from Houston.  The staff here was really great  everyone was attentive and sweet. Which made ordering a lot easier. I had the carne asada and the el conquistador  both were delicious  And for the carne asada the meat was very tender and not chewy at all.  My friends ordered the shrimp taco and the mojo fish taco or something like that.  They both really enjoyed it.  They have an outdoor patio  for pets I believe. But weather was so nice on Monday how could you not sit outside. However we sat inside  Haha We also ordered the watermelon agua fresca it was really delicious  they didn t give ice which I think is a good thing  more room for juice. I just added ice later myself to keep it more cool and refreshing. Their mini salsa bar with levels rating it s spiciness  I got the green one with 3 peppers it was right before the habanero one with 4 peppers.  I think the 3 pepper one was the perfect amount of spicy and flavor. Definitely a good choice  or complimented my Taco very well.  I ll definitely be back here for more 
Tacodeli,220,Yum tacos. Took  30 mins for them to be ready  probably because we went during SXSW  but was delicious. The tacos themselves weren t anything revolutionary  but the green salsa was AMAZING. I d probably just go buy a jar of their salsa and put it on my own breakfast tacos at home. They also have some really nice outdoor seating at this location. Was a great stop after a short hike through the Greenbelt 
Tacodeli,221,I frequented Taco Deli when I lived in Austin. I moved away four years ago  but will forever compare future tacos to Taco Deli. The breakfast tacos here are the best breakfast tacos in town. The migas and the Jess special were my favorite  especially loaded with the salsa dona. This place is tiny and gets really busy  but it s definitely worth the wait. The staff is always cool and friendly.
Tacodeli,222,Ok  so... the crew  absolutely fabulous and friendly  The inside is rather small but there are a plethora of outdoor seating. Parking is scarce  Yikes  But the food... oh the food  Beyond perfection  This is my favorite taco spot in Austin  Farm to table freshness is a consistency and the full menu is spectacular. This is a Austin staple and an absolute must  Can t say enough good things about them 
Tacodeli,223,Kind of the Platonic ideal for a breakfast taco - in the way that one imagines that very simple food should be. Reliable  affordable  easy to eat  with fresh ingredients. Nothing too special  no shtick  just good tacos. Joints like this are the kinds of places that one goes back to again and again  because everything just kind of fits together.
Tacodeli,224,My first experience at a Tacodeli. It was crowded and obviously a very popular place. Menu is large - probably a little too large. You order at the register and then wait with a number for them to bring the food out. In my party of 5  they got 3 of our orders wrong. By the time we realized it  they had already dropped off the food and we weren t able to do much about it except eat mystery tacos that we didn t know what they were. Good thing no one is an overly picky eater. What I ate was good  but it was certainly not what I ordered and I had no idea what it was. I just don t understand how a taco place in an overly saturated market can stay in business with less than 50  accuracy on delivering what was ordered.
Tacodeli,225,By far my most favorite breakfast tacos I ve ever had. I was first introduced to Tacodeli on an Austin food truck tour and I ve been hooked ever since. I can t bring myself to order anything but the Otto. Yum  Their sauces are great too  but the tacos are so tasty they don t really need any unless you re just wanting to add a little spice. Weekends serve breakfast all day. Wish it was all day EVERY day 
Tacodeli,226,I ordered fajitas and they said they didn t have none said they only had sirloin what kind of fake taco place is this
Tacodeli,227,Ah  I ve been to the location in Barton Springs     but never wrote a review and visited this location this weekend.   YUM. Tacos..Austin..just YUM.   They have 6 vegetarian options which is awesome compared to 2 at Torchys  still love Torchys just sayin  and all of them are really good  My favorites are space cowboy and papaditos the one with sweet potatoes.   They re all fresh and unique.   Lots of outdoor seating in this location with dog bowls.
Tacodeli,228,Honestly before our Spring Break visit to Austin we d never heard of Tacodeli. We are huge fans now.   We visited the Spyglass location at 2pm on a weekday afternoon and the place was packed. Had to wait for our food but not nearly as long as told when ordering. The service was fantastic with lots of help in the kitchen and servers continuously delivering orders.  The tacos  Yeah  pretty darn good. We d have to visit five more times to run through the menu. We will be back 
Tacodeli,229,The otto is insane. Freaken vegan is spectacular. Honestly  I wasnt a believer to start  but all it took was an otto to change my mind.
Tacodeli,230,Best breakfast tacos in Austin. Dona sauce is fantastic. Now that it is sold at Whole Foods I put it on everything.
Tacodeli,231,We heard amazing things about deli taco but honestly very anti-climactic. The tacos weren t bad  but we were told  best breakfast tacos of our lives  and they just weren t particularly fresh  flavorful or memorable. With all of the outstanding food options in Austin this is not one we would repeat.
Tacodeli,232,Awesome food and great service. Nice healthy twist on tex mex. Their medium salsa is delicious and smokey. Good guacamole
Tacodeli,233,My  1 favorite spot for breakfast tacos   I more often than not  will pick these up when I m at a farmers market or coffee shop but do walk into an actual free standing one from time to time. The papas egg  amp  cheese with the roja salsa is my go-to. Yum. I m drooling right now just thinking about it   Lines are LONG on the weekends. Call ahead to place your order  but also  well worth the wait.
Tacodeli,234,I adore taco deli  Breakfast or lunch works. The salsas are to die for. One of my favs is the Frontera Fundido tacos with portobellos so flavorful and delicious. I recommend adding their papas and refried black beans to every taco. My go to for breakfast is the Vasquez. This joint is an Austin staple and is highly addictive.
Tacodeli,235,The food was amazing. The service was great. I love the chillness of the workers and the positive vibes they give off. Definitely going back 
Tacodeli,236,We stopped in right before closing after a long hike along the Greenbelt  and it was packed. Tacos are sourced responsibly  hard to write that  and quite satisfying.
Tacodeli,237,With a creative menu and lots of options to personalize your dietary needs and preferences  this taco joint has it all. The food tastes as good as it looks with yummy flavorful heat.
Tacodeli,238,We love this place  walking distance from our house and always the best customer service. Nom Nom we love them so much we buy their salsa and queso at Whole Foods too 
Tacodeli,239,Great food anytime I have been there. Recommend calling ahead or planning to wait they are usually very busy.
Tacodeli,240,Mashed potatoes and eggs may seem like a weird combo  but wow it s good in a taco. That  their freakin  vegan  and all their other breakfast tacos are amazing. Pretty cheap too which is nice  doesn t break the bank.
Tacodeli,241,4  amp  1 2.  This local chainlet serves up some of the better breakfast tacos I ve had in the metro  and we all know that is saying quite a bit considering they may well be the City s signature food  yes even more so than BBQ.  This one also gains points for serving far and away the lightest rendition of the form  which is quite and asset as the concentric circles of eating lightly and eating in Austin rarely overlap.  Shrimps are usually fried in tacos around these parts  yet here they are grilled.  The flavors are fresh and clean all around  and in fact I scarcely remember seeing anything fried offered on the menu.  The chorizo was made in house and was delightfully complemented by partnering with mashed potatoes on one of the delicious breakfast offerings.  Not sure if potatoes are offered in that from on tacos elsewhere  but they sure were dynamite here.  Other ingredients proved just as delicious and fresh tasting  whether they be the perfectly scrambled eggs  savory grilled sirloin or a clean and fresh corn salad-salsa.  Even the corn chips broken up to become the Migas are far less greasy than the norm.  Tortillas  both the corn and flour varieties demonstrated as much evident freshness as the fillings and were likewise way above the norm  even for the area.  The salsa  with the house s signature creamy green variety are a dazzling array of colors and the best I have had in the city  most likely anywhere else.  The chain restaurant decor and vibe and vaguely Truman-show-feeling location in a somewhat remote modern-suburban development location somehow works great to give the place a weird and under the radar feel.  Oh yeah  and they serve really good coffee here too.
Tacodeli,242,dear taco deli   We get old and get used to each other. We think alike. We read each other s minds. We know what the other one wants without asking. Sometimes we irritate each other a little bit. Maybe sometimes take each other for granted.  But once in a while  like today  I meditate on it and realize how lucky I am to share my life with the greatest woman I ever met. You still fascinate and inspire me. You influence me for the better. You re the object of my desire  the  1 earthly reason for my existence. I love you very much.   this  may or may not be  a love letter written by Johnny Cash to June Cash  but every word is true for how I feel about tacos. 
Tacodeli,243,Otto Otto Otto Otto Otto and The Jess Special.   I came here on an extended weekend adventure based off some friends  recommendations  fine line between recommendation and marching orders ... I didn t know what to expect  but holy moly was I glad we came.   We were told to get breakfast tacos--not lunch tacos. SoOOooo being food adventurers  we tried nearly all of them. This led not only to a food coma  but two very happy west coast children. I can authoritatively say  you should eat at least one Otto and at least one Jess Special--especially if you re a spice n00b like me.   Tacos were deliciously flavorful  soft and tasty. Staff was  intimidatingly  cool and friendly. Picnic tables   childhood   awesome.   A  
Tacodeli,244,One of my favorite places to eat tacos  Just a little bit pricey  But it was worth it  I think I have tried all the tacos they serve  The best sauce they have is the Donna sauce 
Tacodeli,245,As far as taco places go  this one is fab. I adore the breakfast tacos  especially the potato  egg and cheese. The potatoes are delicious mashed goodness and slathered in the dona sauce  the best way to start a Monday morning. I see some people are put off on the mashed papas  but I think they are like comfort food. The only problem I ve ever had is that the cheese is sometimes not melted  so I have to zap it in the micro when I get back to the office.  I also think their salads are really good  with  fresh  crisp lettuce and a tangy vinaigrette. Every taco I have ever tried here has been fresh and tasty. Considering I could walk to it from my office  I am one lucky lady.
Tacodeli,246,How  Just how   This place is so good.. Some of the best tacos I ve ever tried. My favorites were the Cowboy  pollo mole  and al pastor   There s always a bit of a line but it moves quickly and there s ample street parking if the parking lot is full. The green sauce and habanero are a must on everything  Also  the service it great 
Tacodeli,247,THIS LOCATION IS CURRENTLY A FOOD TRUCK TIL JULY 2016     They have a limited menu  but still plenty of tasty tacos to choose from--if you love tacos  you shouldn t be disappointed.  P.S. Tacodeli makes the best goddamn breakfast tacos in all of Austin. imo. But if you think you know of a better breakfast taco  message me 
Tacodeli,248,Taco deli is damn good. The al pastor and carne asada is the jams. The line can be long and finding a table can be difficult  but still worth it. 100  vibes
Tacodeli,249,Was super disappointed today when I got my space cowboy. I had to do a double check on if they even got the right taco. It tasted great but was SMALL  like 5 bites. For a taco that cost  4.06 and is all veggies it was wayyyyyyyy too expensive  See posted pic...
Tacodeli,250,Great tacos. Great atmosphere.   Had some kind of pulled chicken taco and was completely blown away. Maybe it was the fact that I haven t eaten since last night but it was delicious. The service is good and the vibe of the place is solid.   Will be back.
Tacodeli,251,I never understood a good taco until I moved to Austin.  It s not a Texas thing...it s an Austin thing     I don t get the bad reviews on Taco Deli and think they just ordered the wrong thing or didn t add salsa.  It s literally deliciousness rolled up in a tortila.  The Dona sauce transforms any taco into a taco of spicy heaven  especially the Jess breakfast taco.  The cowboy taco...omg....amazing concoction of beef tenderloin  corn  onions  and guac.  I could survive on one of them  but two does the trick.  The fundido is a winner also.    The staff is great too.  They bring your food out to you without you needing to hold onto a number or waiting at the front.  They clean up for you if they see you have dirty dishes.  They ll even bring a dog bowl of water for your furry friend.    So why the one star   Their queso is no bueno.  It s okay as I don t need to inhale tons of chips and queso anyway at my age  but every now and hungover then it would be nice.    Support your local taco shop and head over to Taco Deli right now.  Advice is to go early or late because it s super busy at lunchtime.
Tacodeli,252,Excellent tacos with very large portions of meat. Great soft drinks. Delicious chips  queso and salsa. Overall a great place to grab a meal.
Tacodeli,253,5 stars for food but the staff is unfriendly and made me feel as if they were doing me a favor by making me tacos. On my first visit  unfamiliar with the process  my turn in line came up. Instead of saying  next in line  or something to that effect  the guy halfheartedly signaled me over  looking annoyed that I didn t know better. Today  I ordered and the guy completely misunderstood my order. After correcting the order taker  I was told 10-15 minutes for my order. For 2 tacos   The place wasn t even busy  I went outside to kill time and check out the patio area  and came back literally 4 minutes later with some girl yelling my name already.  1. Get a better system for notifying when an order is ready. 2. Dont be lazy when estimating wait times. 3. Teach your staff some lessons in customer service. I won t be revisiting this restaurant. Instead  I ll continue to eat their tacos at Houndstooth downtown  the airport location  or maybe give their downtown location a shot. Either way  what a shame such great food is tainted by arrogance.
Tacodeli,254,Love this place  I ve only been here twice but recently started working near it and will be coming much more often  I absolutely love the outdoor seating when it s nice outside. Overall amazing place to try new tacos don t expect any tex-mex   also they have a good variety of hot sauce choices and they re all really good 
Tacodeli,255,I love tacodeli  This location is currently under construction and running out of a truck.  Once the store opens back up I would recommend going to grab a breakfast or lunch taco and some queso    I love trying their specialty tacos  but am a fan of the usual Otto taco for breakfast    It s a small location to pop in and out  not the best for a group event unless you plan on taking the tacos to go    Grab a deli card and start to rack up points for free tacos 
Tacodeli,256,Being from Ohio  we don t get nearly enough breakfast tacos. I took a friend to a taco deli location and he was blown away. I am personally a person that gets the chorizo  egg  and mashed potatoes. That s right  mashed potatoes on a breakfast taco are absolutely unbelievable. I really enjoyed the coffee and I also enjoyed the soft drinks. They have Maine root soft drinks and I think that those are some of the best that I ve had outside of your regular big boys.
Tacodeli,257,Stopped in for a taco before our hike.  Wow  so tasty  I had a breakfast taco that included mashed potatoes and it was just so yummy  One of the best tacos I ate in Austin that week... and I ate many 
Tacodeli,258,Great food and the best service  Everyone was so friendly and helpful. One gentleman came up to us and asked if we had been there before and then explained the menu and answered some of our questions.
Tacodeli,259,I love love love love LOVE their breakfast tacos.   Not only do they use my favorite eggs but they have non-gmo corn tortillas. On top of that  they re super gluten free friendly. Score    Plus the salsas...are all so delicious  I am obsessed with their watermelon agua fresca.   I really like this location but parking is tough when they are busier.
Tacodeli,260,We visited from out of state and were told to pay a visit to Tacodeli. Best. Recommendation. Ever.   The employees were so kind  patient  and funny  The location was beautiful  and we worked off some calories walking the trails across the street. The food was fresh and delicious. Don t forget to order the queso 
Tacodeli,271,I d like to start off by saying I love the name   . To me a deli better have darn good sandwiches that I can t slap together myself. This place certainly has darn good tacos that I can t make.  This place is hopping at lunch time....so hopping that some of our orders got dropped. Thankfully though  after we pointed it out the cooks promptly rolled out our tacos and the manager swung by with free chips and queso  which are pretty darn good   and some free breakfast taco coupons to make up for it. That s what I call service.  That aside  I really really really strongly recommend the Delibelli  a saturday lunch special. It s a braised pork belly taco with avocado. Intense porky flavor  rich avocado in a flour tortilla to cut the grease back a little  yum. The cowboy is flavorful sirloin  smattering of cheese and some more avocado too.   Agua Fresca is really good here too. Recommend the cantaloupe or the horchata   Strongly recommend this place  though maybe take out next time to avoid trying to flounder around for a seat.
Tacodeli,272,I haven t eaten a legit taco since I ve became a pescatarian. But this place had an option of seafood and vegetarian tacos to pick from. Ordered a blue plate with a shrimp taco and a vegetarian cowboy taco. The blue plate comes with rice and beans. It was sooooo good and filling. Loved every bite of it. And the best part is the different sauces you can get. They have 5 different kinds and they all taste amazing. Loved the fast service and the friendly atmosphere.
Tacodeli,273,I live next to this location. I am here all the time and the quality is always the best.  Great product sourcing  great staff  and delicious tacos.  I hosted an event recently for 65 people that I needed catered. TacoDeli hit it out of the park. The driver was there early and helped with delivery and setup. Everyone was so happy and raved about the food.  5 GOLDEN STARS.
Tacodeli,274,Was just as good as everyone said it would be.  I enjoyed the whole Austin experience  even as a local.  The white cheese is the boss and you can t go wrong with any taco.  Try ordering online if you re in a rush.  I only tried lunch ones.  I ll come back for breakfast  but I hear they are just as good.  Too bad there isn t one in South Austin.
Tacodeli,275,1-you must try the cowboy taco it is amazing 2-I m kind of a freak for the pollo fantastica taco as well 3-do a salsa is the best avocado jalape o salsa around I don t think I ve had anything here that was short of delicious. The inside it really small and this place usually has a line out the door. Lots of seating outside though. I always like that the chips are in a sealed bag  pretty sure they are fresh made but consistently cooked perfect no raw icky ones like some places 
Tacodeli,276,Check their daily specials for your favorite taco day.  Love  Love  Love me some TacoDeli.    They have a unique daily special almost everyday of the week.  My favorite tacos have to be the Scallop  Thursday Special  and the Cowboy Taco  but I have filled my gullet with many on my frequent visits to their locations.  There are a lot of Taco spots in Austin  but this is the best in my opinion.  My favorite location is their Spyglass location near Zilker.    The only complaint I have is I wish they would make or have delivered homemade tortillas.  If they did this the DEA might have to step in because their food would be more addictive than CRACK   
Tacodeli,277,This place isn t what it used to be. The woman at the register interrupted me twice as I ordered to talk to someone she knew. I specifically told her I didn t want salmon when she asked if that would suffice as a replacement for the fish they didn t had  I ordered a different tack instead and somehow ended up with a wet salmon taco that was falling apart. I got my food at 2 45 and didn t feel like bugging the chefs. Anyways... back to papalote.  PS  have the prices gone up  Holy cow it was like 12 bucks for two small tacos
Tacodeli,278,For the life of me  I can t understand why so many people in Austin rave about Tacodeli. It s not good in a Mexican food sense. It s not good even in a  hipster taco  sense  Torchy s is a far better option if you want a faux-Mexican  taco  .  Every time I ve tried Tacodeli  I ve found the following to be true   1  tiny tacos and tiny side portions 2  overpriced food 3   tacos  trying way too hard to be trendy  rather than just good 4  an overall mediocre and unremarkable experience  A friend of mine has said that the best way to eat Tacodeli fare is to let it grow cold  and then reheat it  as that makes it palatable. I ve never tried that  but if the food isn t as good coming out of the kitchen as it is coming out of your microwave  then Tacodeli  we have a problem.
Tacodeli,279,Amazing breakfast tacos  If you re not coming super early  make sure you call in your order so that you can head straight to the separate pick up window inside  unless you enjoy waiting in line. We got here around 10 45am on a Sunday and it was really busy- there was a long line to place your order. However  it only took a few minutes to grab our order from the pick up line. Since we were trying as many places as possible during our short trip to Austin  we only ordered The Jess Special  Scrambled Eggs w Migas Mix  Topped w Monterrey Jack Cheese  Sliced Avocado   2.85   a href  http   www.yelp.com user_local_photos select -v8HQ-C29oUWi1MfUxXYSw amp userid 76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg  yelp.com user_local_phot   a    which was delicious  The flour tortilla was nice and chewy  and the ingredients were super flavorful. I loved that one of the salsas was actually spicy  and both had good flavor. I would highly recommend this taco  and would definitely come back to try additional tacos if I were back in Austin. Parking can be tough since their lot isn t that big.
Tacodeli,280,Tacodeli is life. This location is right by my friend s office and another friend s apartment  so I see myself frequenting it a lot. Parking is super easy  which is a perk because sometimes the lot at the lamar location is always cram packed that you have to find parking elsewhere  so bonus points to this location. The inside is smaller than other Tacodelis I ve been to  but they make up for it with their quick service. We got our food in seconds.   The cowboy taco is a classic that I have to get every single time I go into a shop. It didn t disappoint. Also the delibelly is an amazing taco that is a special on Wednesdays. The meat is so tender. I definitely recommend getting it 
Tacodeli,281,Arrived around 11am  which is when lunch tacos start being made  There was already a line that took me 10 minutes to get thru  after ordering a carne Asada  Mexican sirloin  and fish taco I had to wait 15 minutes for them.  Maybe skyrocketing Austin rent has forced me to reassess how much I spend eating out  but these  lunch tacos are too small for how much they cost   4-5 . Mexican places have tacos twice as large for half the price.   The customer service is fine  but honestly you are just overpaying for long lines  long waits and adequate tacos. It s a hipster scene.
Tacodeli,282,Always fantastic.  And breakfast all day on the weekends  hooray  They close early  3 3 30pm  so make sure to go for breakfast or lunch.
Tacodeli,283,There is no other. There is only TacoDeli.  Austin has many great taco spots. But nothing has the quality  consistency  flavor  and absolute magic of TacoDeli.   The ingredients are fresh  the recipes are creative  and the salsa dona is absolutely DOPE.   I lived across the street for a year- best decision I ever made.
Tacodeli,284,This was the very first place I took my dad when he came to visit me in Austin for the first time. He wanted somewhere to go eat that was  good  cheap  and Austin-y  and I said I knew just the place. After he scarfed down an Al Pastor and a Cowboy Taco  he was definitely pleased with my choice.  I ve been coming here for years and have always LOVED Tacodeli s tacos  no matter what I get. They re fresh  juicy  flavorful... just add a Mexican Coke and I m in heaven. My personal favorite is the El Conquistador  but I also adore the Freakin  Vegan. Truthfully  you can t go wrong with whatever taco you choose here.  I just wish this place didn t close at 3pm. There have been so many times when I wanted to just go here for dinner or pick up some tacos for later. Maybe I could understand closing this early on the weekdays  but the weekend  Sigh.
Tacodeli,285,5 s too much but 4  way too little. We had one each of the breakfast tacos and all were fabulous. Personally loved the Otto but all very good. And I loved the salsas  especially the creamy green one  not the tomatillo one . Only bad thing was the renovation going on which obviously is temporary. I would return here in a heartbeat.
Tacodeli,286,We had Tacodeli cater our wedding and it was amazing  Not just the food though. The service and communication was perfect  Brady answered all of our questions and walked us through everything we needed to know decide. When they transferred us over to the Spyglass location we had the same experience. I am so glad we chose Tacodeli 
Tacodeli,287,I ordered two bacon egg and cheese tacos and I did get what I ordered  but it was not to the quality I was expecting based on how several people suggested I try it. The cheese was good  the egg was ok but the bacon was way too burnt and even after leaving I could still taste the unpleasant burnt bacon taste for at least another hour. I hope that s not how it normally is and it is as good as people say  that just wasn t my experience.
Tacodeli,288,Just had tacos there this morning  and head back to Houston     It was delicious      We are visiting a old friend. It s tax free weekend  so we wanna go to San Marcis shopping. So we decide stay one day in Austin and try local food. Tacodeli is so good  The environment is cute  many local people go there and get food after run in the morning. Our friend love close  he told us it s one of his favorite place. Really worth to try 
Tacodeli,289,Got here at 11am for lunch.   Beat the crowd and..... The food.... The tacos.... Had a breakfast miga   then a Mojo fish and Tikin Xic.  Now I know what to ask for if ever I find myself on death row.
Tacodeli,290,You can t beat it  I don t care what out of town reviewers say.  In addition to having tremendous variety  I m looking at you  Torchys  they re always friendly  clean and definitely consistent.  The fillings are yum  and I trust them to source locally when possible. And the tortillas are always fresh and pliant    I also love the salsas and appreciate that it s self serve.   I d like to see less landfill wasteplease get rid of the plastic    And yes  there are taco trucks  but most look like they re offering some free organisms as a side..... Avoid 
Tacodeli,291,I was told that  before I left Austin  I had to try the  other  taco place besides Torchy s. That brought me to Tacodeli one day for lunch. I managed to beat the lunch rush on a Thursday  but I saw it come as I was eating. So  a beginning note  Try to avoid the rush. The staff was quick and ably handled the many taco-craving customers  but if you re stomach is rumbling  come early.  On to the tacos. I tried four  which was enough to leave me full but not  get me a wheelbarrow  full. Being of the non-meat-eating type  I went with the Shrimp Taco  the Fish Taco  which on this day was Mahi Mahi  usually it is the Texas drum fish  whatever that may be   the Space Cowboy  portabello mushroom and a poblano pepper sauce   and the Florentino  spinach  portabello  and red peppers .   I started with the Space Cowboy  and it probably was my favorite of the options. I appreciated the heaping serving of guac on top  not overwhelmed by the sprinkled queso fresco. The portabello was pretty thickly cut  so if you re not a huge mushroom fan  as my dining companion is not   don t pick this one. I  however  am a  shroom lover  so I enjoyed this taco. The marinate gave the taco lots of flavor but was not so overpowering that it dominated the other flavors. As an overall note  I also appreciate that the  flour  tortillas were not double wrapped. The single layer was sturdy enough to hold in all fixings  and without the extra wrap it wasn t so filling.  The extra wrapping likely would have taken me to wheelbarrow status.   The Florentino was a dud. There were fewer veggies  so the taco was pretty small. And no flavor stood out. This one needed salsa and probably more than I added. It was missing something. I say either add more salsa or some guac or stay away  unless you need minimal flavor to be satiated.  On to the fish  I dove into  pun intended  the Fish taco. This one was solid  too. The fish was flaky and had lots of chili flavor from the rub. All the flavors sang together  and it was nice and hearty. No complaints here. The shrimp taco  on the other hand  just tasted like shrimp. I m still tasting it now. It was as if they had used shrimp cocktail instead of the advertised grilled shrimp  and the aftertaste of shrimp is just lingering on my tongue. Moreover  the onion inside wasn t too grilled  so it crunched and munched the way thick  long slices of onion shouldn t in a taco. I d pass on that one again.  I was told the scallop special on Thursdays was tasty  the salmon taco was awkward  and  personally  I think salmon is a terrible  unacceptable choice for a fish taco   and as noted above  the mushroom in the Space Cowboy was too much  a point with which I don t entirely agree. Another point in favor of the quick  friendly service. But if I come back to visit Austin and feel the need for tacos  and I think I would   I m going with Torchy s. Or I d pick neither Tacodeli nor Torchy s and instead choose a local food truck. Those are good options  too. Branch out  fellow Yelpers. There is more to the world  and  specifically  Austin proper  than two taco joints 
Tacodeli,292,Great fantastic food. A really great Tex Mex establishment.   I particularly enjoyed the guacamole and salsa. The tacos have some pretty unique combos to them and the beans are not traditional but tasty for sure.   This one will make it on the repeat list for sure 
Tacodeli,293,Wow. Food and customer experience is amazing. Very friendly peeps  must try the cowboy taco 
Tacodeli,294,Their Freakin Vegan taco is amazing. This location is so much better than the one is Westlake  the food just taste better  there are more dogs  and the staff is friendlier. They have an amazing selection of tacos from different types of pork and beef  to vegan options  and killer guacamole.
Tacodeli,295,They are back with the new storefront  and it s great. More room and more efficient.   Love me some taco deli. Breakfast tacos and fish tacos are great. 4 stars instead of 5 because chips and queso and chips and guacamole are subpar.  Guacamole is way too lemon-y  chips come in a plastic sealed bag. . Also their hours are silly -- closes at 3      If I had to eat at only one taco place in Austin it d be Torchy s  not Taco Deli  but they are still good.
Tacodeli,296,After reading several positive and negative reviews I decided to take a chance mostly because they have a decent vegetarian selection.   Small Corazon-5 star salad with jalape o ranch dressing and fresh  crisp romaine.  The Heather-5 stars. Delicious and cheesy with a nice balance of ingredients.  Papadulce-5 stars. The taco was both sweet and smoky with tons of flavor.  Several reviews mentioned a scarcity of ingredients. That was not the case for me. I don t know if it s because I didn t get meat  but I was pleased with the portion size and the customer service. Next time I m in Austin I will be back.
Tacodeli,297,Tacodeli is the best overall taco restaurant in town    From breakfast tacos to specialty pork belly tacos they re all amazing and their tortilla s are always fresh. With every taco if you can handle the heat you need to try the green sauce it s extremely spicy but it s a burn that hurts is a good way. My favorites are the steak breakfast tacos and the garlic fish taco  mojo  on corn.    Con  Mexican mashed potatoes aren t very flavorful and aren t worth the stomach space.  Top tacos  1. Migas 2. Otto 3. Sirloin  Egg  amp  Cheese 4. Mojo fish taco
Tacodeli,298,Unbelievable slow. I mean almost 30 mins for 2 tacos. Four people standing around playing in their phone while numerous people are waiting  will NEVER return    
Tacodeli,299,two words  EL PASTOR  i could eat that taco every day for the rest of my life and be perfectly content. the juicy pork is perfectly seasoned and every bite is a flavor explosion. i have tried all the home made sauces  and they are all dangerously addictive. i love you taco deli so very much.
Tacodeli,300,I got simply 1 word for you all and 1 word only. Taco freaking deli  baby  Gimme 5 it is amazing  I want to meet the owner and shake his hand really hard
Tacodeli,301,Yum yum yum  We are from San Diego and since there were so many taco places we had to try them all  Taco deli was our first stop as recommended by locals and it did not disappoint  It was more authentic not so much Tex next style and we loved it  Chicken and pork  Yum 
Tacodeli,302,I ordered a breakfast taco here and it was the weirdest breakfast taco I ve ever had.   I ordered eggs  sausage and potatoes. But what came out was a surprise. I saw egg... And I saw the sausage.... But I also saw this gravy like substance underneath the eggs and sausage.   It wasn t gravy... It was mashed potatoes. Really mashed... Because it wasn t thick or anything. It as like cream liquid potatoes.   Yeah  I know.   Never again.
Tacodeli,303,Not a bad taco. I ate it  it was good. I can t imagine waiting in line for one. I ve heard Taco Deli is an institution for some people. Valentina s real deal Holyfield still reigns supreme.
Tacodeli,304,I wish you could give 10 stars. 5 doesn t do it justice. This isn t your simple taco place. The flavors of each taco that comes out of here seems like they were devised by some magician taco genius.   There. Isn t. A. Bad. Option.   I ve tried everything on the menu numerous times. Not once has any of them been sub par. Definitely a must try and I guarantee it will become a regular stop for you. Once you start  you ll get hooked and you ll start craving Tacodeli everyday  Ahhhh so delicious
Tacodeli,305,Taco Deli is amazing. By far the best breakfast tacos in Austin. Try the Jess Special - you can thank me later.   My only complaint about this is the limited space to stand  eat  wait. They are always busy and there s not a lot of seating or standing spots. I m sure it s not a bad problem for them though   Save time and call you order in and pick it up instead of waiting in the line.
Tacodeli,306,The infinite variety of the taco experience is vividly represented by this fine establishment. I came to Austin for work and ate tacos every morning  and every morning was different. Since I knew that I was going to eat a lot of greasy food truck stuff later on some days  I had some of the excellent vegan selections in the restaurant. On days when I knew I had a long day  I filled up with egg and sirloin.   Most taco places offer mediocre tortillas  but Taco Deli s are perfect. Not too fluffy or hard. Just corny goodness enveloping a magical rainbow of flavor and magic. Beans and avocado are spiced with various salsas and lime in a way that brings out each individual flavor. Eggs are all local  and beff is lovingly cooked to perfection.   The employees are helpful and friendly and happy that you are there. I will be looking forward to taco deli the next time I m in town.
Tacodeli,307,Yum. Yum. And oh yeah  yum  The quality of the meat here was fantastic  and this particular location near the Barton Greenbelt trailhead was especially scenic and relaxed. We sat out on their patio and greatly enjoyed a leisurely meal. We got several recommendations from the very helpful cashier  and also tried a couple others that sounded good. Our favorite by far was the Cowboy. Jesus  it was good. We went back for more of that one. Twice.
Tacodeli,308,Man oh man... I was struggling to decide what to order from the breakfast menu. The menu was simple in it s mixes  no more than a few ingredients each  which really let s the tastes com through.  The sirloin was well seasoned and fit well into a breakfast meal. Recommend 2-3 tacos per person and you ll come out satisfied.  Only bad point  they went heavy on the egg and seemed to skimp on the other ingredients. Even the migas seemed too egg heavy.
Tacodeli,309,After some bad experiences at the Lamar location I decided to try this one. Once again I get one sliver of avocado in my bean  amp  avocado tacos. After paying to get extra avocado for 2 tacos I got two teeny pieces. Avocados are  1 at Whole Foods - what gives 
Tacodeli,310,Taco Deli is a perfect taco drop spot. You really can t go wrong with anything on the menu.   I favor  like many  the cowboy taco choice. For the vegetarian they offer it as a space cowboy. Not advertised  but for those who want the vegi happiness medley but want chicken over beef just request a cowgirl instead.   They re easy going and kind people the taco folk at the deli. They take requests for customization and dietary issues seriously and without question.   They have a loyalty program through a swipe card system. It works alright but it is certainly less satisfying than a classic punch card where you visually see the status every time you open your wallet.   They have multiple locations across town  but the original location here will always be my home no matter how far I go.   As a general rule I stop by taco deli  Torchys  or both before leaving the state of Texas. It doesn t feel right leaving town with a belly full of deli.
Tacodeli,311,Got a taco while hiking the greenbelt. I didn t eat it until an hour or so later and it was still one of the most delicious tacos I ve had. They use good quality eggs and meats and one of the few trucks I feel good about eating meat at. Wish I had gotten more  Next time Austin.
Tacodeli,312,I was very disappointed in this place. It was extremely pack and pretty much it felt like you were eating on top of each other. The tacos were just okay at best. I felt like i could have gone to whataburger and gotten the same quality of breakfast tacos. the only thing that was enjoyable was the salsa. I left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.
Tacodeli,313,This place was surprisingly really good. I love the seafood tacos. I had the one with salmon  another with scallops and another with mole. As much as I loved the food  I thought the employees were even better.   I did not like the pina lime jalapeno drink. However  it is just one item of many items.
Tacodeli,314,This place has the BEST tacos  They had a ceviche taco as a taco of the day  which I have never seen- so if you re like me and love ceviche  and love tacos  you HAVE to get the ceviche taco  There are so many options  I had to ask which one the cashier recommended and she suggested the cowboy which was very yummy as well  I ll definitely be going here more frequently it s right next to my work  The only downside is they re only open until 3pm
Tacodeli,315,Being a Texas newbie  this was my first experience with breakfast tacos. And now I have an addiction. My bowls of cereal for breakfast just don t taste as good anymore.   This place is amazing. They offer whole wheat tortillas if you want. The sirloin one was the bomb. But the veggie spinach one was delicious as well. Cute little spot with picnic tables and other outdoor seating. Plenty of parking in the lot or nearby.  Mmmmm I could go for one of these right now.
Tacodeli,316,Love this place.  Do yourself a solid and get you some mashed potatoes. They re right on time.  You know what else I love about this place  The food and service are consistently great.  And it doesn t hurt that they got all those salsas to choose from. I should send them a love letter.  Oh Tacodeli  how I love thee.... That may be too on the nose but it s a start.
Tacodeli,317,Loved this place  I have the Indian styled taco every time and it s so good  I loved the aesthetics and the outdoor area. Usually really busy but I love it  My dog is also a fan  as pictured 
Tacodeli,318,The only thing that I would change about this place is that I would keep it open later than 3pm. That way I could get to it during the week  and not just on the weekends. Everything that I have tried has been great. I ve had their breakfast tacos more than once  but I usually stick with the Taco Blanco. I like that you can customize your own and not adhere strictly to the menu options.   The staff is friendly and upbeat  and do the best they can to get your order out as quick as possible. A top notch place... they should open more of them around town 
Tacodeli,319,This place is so so so so sew so great  Definitely one o  da best taco joints in Austin nestled in a lil office park area thing.  I love the menu above the cash register. Look  No hands   Everything s awesome especially the breakfast tacos. Great value for high quality tacos at  1.85 for a build ya own with 2 ingredients and 40 cents more for each additional ingredient. So many choices 
Tacodeli,320,My go to place to order for delivery to the office. The buffet is always a hit with my coworkers  amp  we get the papadulce pan for a vegetarian option. The folks that deliver the food are always fantastic  arriving on time  quietly unpacking  amp  setting up the buffet line and labeling everything. I always get TacoDeli when we have out of town visitors. Always great things from TacoDeli 
Tacodeli,321,Currently a food truck with a limited menu at this location  Still the perfect place to grab a breakfast taco and take a walk in the green belt. I love their chorizo here  All of the fish tacos are incredible. I think the ultimate bucket list would Be trying every taco on this menu...you can t go wrong here.
Tacodeli,322,Really  I don t get it.  I could get a breakfast burrito from the grungiest place in San Diego and it would be better than this. And would cost a lot less.  I got the migas supreme plate  or something  and it came with mashed potatoes  that was pureed like baby food--not appetizing   beans  migas  basically scrambled eggs with a little cheese   tortillas  I ordered corn but they gave me flour  and some salsa.  It was all bland and average.  My eating partner got two breakfast tacos  the Otto and another one where he chose the ingredients. He got a taco with chorizo and it was just sprinkled on the top  like a condiment. He said the chorizo was  a joke . He REALLY didn t like his tacos.  The 4 salsas in their salsa bar were good  and some had some heat.
Tacodeli,323,Fresh and affordable  as always.  It s popular and crowded even beyond the usual dining hours.  Finding a table takes time  sometimes.  Likewise for finding a parking spot.
Tacodeli,324,What s not to love about Taco Deli  the best tacos in town   Such variety  and so much yum.  Their company culture is great  and I ll miss them when I leave Austin.
Tacodeli,325,Our family loves Tacos and we came in exactly for those famous Tacos   We ordered Quesu chips and Guacamole to start with. I must say this place has one of the best quesu in town  -  We ordered Chicken Adobe Taco  Migas  happy taco and the Fish Tacos. They all were so flavorful  but the Fish tacos were Amazing   They also have some sauces on the side and we loved the creamy green and Habanero sauce. They were really spicy but awesome 
Tacodeli,326,I read that this place is among the top ten places in America for tacos  so I drove to Austin for a Sunday brunch here. I m happy I read that article. The menu is really long with a lot of variety. Every taco I had was amazing here. It s a must try if you love tacos 
Tacodeli,327,This place is just OK in my book  nothing to write home about.   I ve sampled a variety of the tacos here and the  cowboy  is by far my favorite.  I had their ahi tuna Friday special and I like Torchy s better.
Tacodeli,328,This was my first stop while visit Austin and it was so good  I would make this my local spot if I lived here. Very carefree vibe and our breakfast tacos were excellent. Wish I could have been around for lunch because the selections looked mouth watering. Until we meet again  Tacodeli  XOXO from NYC
Tacodeli,329,The parking situation is a bit iffy but there was plenty of street parking when we went. The line wasn t very long and finding a table outside wasn t a problem. The only part that irked me was there wasn t enough shade. It was a little weird that the people that worked there were constantly walking around looking for people and well  if you re gonna order your food  be around to claim it  There s other people that want their food too.   Anywho  I only went for the breakfast tacos which were really good. My cousin and husband got one of the tacos with the pork belly and the said it was really good.
Tacodeli,330,Among the best food we had during our week in Austin were the tacos we had at Tacodeli as our first meal in Austin.  After visiting the Barton Creek Farmer s Market in the morning on our way into town  we stopped at the Tacodeli on Spyglass for lunch thanks to Yelp reviews.  We wish Tacodeli was in our neighborhood so we could work our way through the menu   That s the bottom line  here are the details that might also come in handy for visitors to Austin in choosing Tacodeli    FOOD  We selected the chicken mole tacos and a vegetarian taco specialty called Papadulce that contained roasted sweet potatoes and peppers  caramelized onions  toasted pepitas and a spicy sauce called camote.   Wish we knew what was in that sauce and the mole because both choices were addictingly good.  As were the red  green and dona salsas on the salsa bar.  We were lukewarm about the habenero salsa  no pun intended  and think La Condesa s habanero rendition gets the gold star for that.     Aside  Read a news article about the small chain s history  there are three in Austin  while we waited on our order and we learned the founder  a UT grad  was perhaps the first to introduce Austin to mole sauce in the 1990 s.   The kitchen is obviously using top quality ingredients  many from local sources we understand.  And the menu  which is mostly gluten free by the natural design of Mexican street food  includes something for everyone  including vegan options.   VALUE   At only  3.25   order for our choices  a good value for the great food with lunch for two under seven bucks.  SERVICE  Order at the window  try to find a seat in or out and they ll deliver to your table.  Given how busy they were  service was amazingly efficient and everyone was really friendly.   Do everyone behind you in line a favor and know what you want to order by the time you get to the front of the line.   AMBIANCE   This is definitely a  Keep Austin Weird  kind of place.  It is not cozy and relaxing if that s what you re looking for.  But you can always take out if eating in doesn t appeal.   ACCESSIBILITY   They tried it seems.  But the reality is the Spyglass location may pose quite a challenge for someone using a wheelchair.  Hard to understand why the problems here aren t corrected.  Would be easy to do.  The equal access standards have been around to use as direction since 1990.   Here s the rundown  1  Accessible parking in the front of the building.  2  No table height seating inside  all seating is all high perch bar height.  So wheelchair users - like some guys I know who are war vets - and those dining with them will find table height seating outside only  if weather permits.  As related aside  This kind of high seating is so great for customers with small children either.  I avoid taking photos with children in them if I haven t asked parents permission  but parents sitting next to us with two little kids were having trouble keeping their children safely seated too.   3  Bathroom is accessible if you can get to it in a wheelchair  but tight path of travel would be a problem it seemed to me.  TIP for TRAVELERS   Open at 7a weekdays and 8a weekends  close at 3p. Breakfast options served until 11a on weekdays and all day on weekends.
Tacodeli,331,There are way better taco joints in Austin. They put mashed potatoes in their breakfast tacos. That says it all.
Tacodeli,332,A voice of dessent.  Not for the food mind you.  Sadly  I didn t get to try it.  Here s he story   I am in from out of town for the SXSW film festival.  Given the NYT article  I picked one moring to explore and get a breakfast taco.  Got out late  but figured hey  I cant be alone.. I m sure breakfast taco s are being served all day.  So  I take a drive to Tacodeli from downtown  and get there around 11 30.  Roll up to the server and ask for a breakfast taco.   Me  all happy    Two delcious breakfast taco s please    Server   Sorry  we are no longer serving breakfast taco s   Me  wind sucked    Really...   I thought they were served all day   Her  blankly     Nope.  Only on weekends   Me  begging     Ow...well  Im from way out of town and drove a real far way just for these breakfast tacos   Her  bored irritated    We can give you one with potaoes.  Just no eggs   Me  summoning Larry David    That s what makes it a breakfast taco.  Really..you can t just crack open an egg   Her   blank stare.  Luckily  a dude in the kitchen noticed my deep sadness irritation  and recommended I go to Texas Honey Ham as they served 24 7.  And I did.  And I was happy.  That place is like The Giving Tree of breakfast tacos.    So 2 stars for the gentleman in the kitchen for keeping it real.  But a pretty big boo to the lady at the register who seemed a lot more interested in being strict with the rules than helping a cusomer with a unique situation request.
Tacodeli,333,I love a good street taco. These were fab  I was able to enjoy these outside of the ACK live on a drizzly Saturday. I would love to have more on my next trip to Austin.
Tacodeli,334,I got four tacos  carne asada  Mexico City sirloin and chicken and another chicken one I don t remember. Loved these tacos much more than Any other taco I ve had in Austin. I wish I came to this location sooner. I didn t even use any of their famous hot sauces because I was so caught up just stuffing my face. They have every thing for every one here  Look up the menu and I promise you won t be disappointed. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I definitely want to go to this location once more before I leave.
Tacodeli,335,I was really impressed with this place  I hadn t heard of it before so I decided to give it a try.   I got the Cowboy and the Puerco Verde. The cowboy was soooo packed with flavor and oh so perfect and juicy.  I was mad at myself for putting sauce on it because it really didn t need it.   The puerco verde was very yummy as well. My mom got the scallop taco which was unique but I liked it. I didn t really care for the corn tortilla that they suggested but that s probably just because I prefer flour over anything.   It was pretty busy when I went-  noon on a Thursday but the line was quick and the orders came out quick as well. The staff were very friendly.  Overall I love this place and I m definitely coming back for some breakfast tacos 
Tacodeli,336,Went back to tacodeli with my friend who loves the Al Pastor here I gotta admit its better than your average taco stand  having eaten here a few times ordering is a bit easier but I still don t understand why the soda machine has to be right in the line to order.
Tacodeli,337,I heart cowboy tacos.  To the point where I forgive Tacodeli for not serving  all  their tacos during breakfast hours... and for closing at the unreasonably early hour of 3 pip-emma.... cowboys are perfectly marinated flavorful steak  sliced up  with avocado and corn and onion and spicy stuff and peppers and some cotija cheese  I think... dribble on some roasted red salsa and stuff  stuff  stuff into your mouth.  I try to eat them slowly and with ladylike precision  mainly to make them last longer  but boy-dilly  it s so hard.  I want to gorge on these like ... like... like a teenage boy would.    I also love the chicken fundido frontera.  Yummy chicken  peppers with roasted edges and that smoky  grilled flavor... caramelized onions... mmmmmmm...  Tacodeli please don t open any stores near my house  gym or office.  Please stay just far enough away that you remain my oft-dreamed-of treat.  I love you  tacodeli  I m yours.
Tacodeli,338,did not get what i paid for. i got the space cowboy and was hoping it would be a decent taco but it was so small and cost  4.65. i was not impressed.
Tacodeli,339,Amazing tacos  I thought I had found my favorite tacos at Torchy s  but Tacodeli offers a whole array of tacos that are delectable in their own way...it s honestly hard to compare which I like better  Tacodeli or Torchy s  since each has their own unique flavors that make my mouth water.  It s been a few months since I went  but from what I can remember  the Cowboy Taco was one of my favorites.   The line goes out the door but was worth the wait. Thankfully we went on a gorgeous  sunny day. The inside seating is limited so instead enjoyed our food out on the patio.   Their menu had so many tacos to choose from. I m sure the next time I m in Austin  I ll be sure try try out a few more 
Tacodeli,340,Decent. Not great.  Tried the Migas taco and a Bacon and Egg.   Bacon was burned to that dry fail flavorless state.  Everything else was fairly underwhelming as well.  Could make better Tavo at home pretty quickly.  The one saving grace is their spicy green hot sauce
Tacodeli,341,Fantastic. A wonderful stop for lunch. The little one-room joint is hard to find  but if you are anywhere near Spyglass Rd.  off the Barton Skyway exit on Mopac   this place will provide plenty of peace and happiness. At least while you re chewing.  Tacodeli is a borderline hole-in-the-wall Mexican place with two locations in Austin. The north one is great  this one on Spyglass is even better. Their hours are horrible  they close at 3pm  and the lunch crowd is a regular buffalo herd of hungry suits and students  but the staff is quick on their feet and the food is fabulous. I had the Vegetarian Burrito and secretly wanted it to be bigger than the already-mammoth-sized roll so I could make my love affair last a bit longer. The chips in a paper sack is fun and practical. Their salsa is addicting. My friend tried the queso and I was stealing dips when she was too busy with her Frontera Fundido Taco. Prices aren t dirt cheap  but no worries  the food is worth your hard-earned cash.  Lick your paper plate clean.
Tacodeli,342,Pretty good tacos  but Veracruz is still better.  The plus for taco deli is that they have brown rice and whole wheat tortillas. But in terms of flavor Veracruz   1  and Torchy s   2  are still much better. Also  taco deli closes at 3 pm.
Tacodeli,343,I came here for breakfast when I was visiting. It was the cutest spot  The line gets long  but it goes by pretty fast. The staff there were so helpful and friendly. I ordered the The Otto and Jess Special tacos. I really liked The Otto. It definitely hit the spot. They have outdoor seating and dogs are welcomed. I am a HUGE taco lover and I highly recommend.
Tacodeli,344, The following events occurred during my order at Tacodeli  Me  Yes  I ll have a blue plate with a Mojo fish taco an- Random dude  On your left. Gettin  iced tea. Me  Aw  geez  I m sorry  man. Random dude  I s coo . Me  And a puerco verd- Random girl  Excuse me. Sorry  gettin  some tea. Me  Oh  sorry   awkwardly readjusts elbow positioning  Random girl  Yeah. No worries.  Me  ...Puerco verde. And that Roberto s queso. And a drink please...  So. Little bit cramped on that left cash register. I was lucky to have quite a few people want some tea while I was standing there. That s pretty much my only complaint  the really cramped feeling of the whole place. I think students and young singles must flock the place from all the surrounding condominiums. And the proximity to the green belt probably draws in some folks looking for a bite before they go hiking. Ohhh the crowd. But DAMN those are some tasty tacos  son.  I went this fine  humid  cold  Austin afternoon with my parents to enjoy Tacodeli for the first time. We walk up  I order  as you read previously  the blue plate with a Mojo fish taco  and a puerco verde. My mom and dad got a Frontera Fundido Sirloin taco  a Bison  and a Tacoloco. To accompany the order we thought we d try Roberto s Brazo-Fuerte  Bob Arm-strong... I see what you did there  Tacodeli  Dip with chips.  We wander outside after navigating the crowded drink dispenser area  no Coca Cola   D     and we try to find a place to sit. All the tables are rather small  and we only find one that s open besides the porch bar. My mom was uncomfortable because her chair was teetering into a hole in the deck  and she didn t have much room to move around  so we relocated to the bar seating on the edge of the patio. Little bit better  but the railing-table-bar-thing was too thin if you ask me. Little more width on that sucker would make dining a much easier experience with chips and queso AND tacos all in one space. But eh.  The queso came out first  rather quickly  served with a bag of chips  a basket  and some queso. Why a basket AND a bag  I m not sure. The basket would have been fine. The Roberto s Brazo-Fuerte Dip wa pretty good. Nice  light cheese  good pico  good guac  decent meat  could have used more . It wasn t too thick  which I thought was refreshing for a queso. So that was pleasant.  The tacos arrive and my blue plate is a little bit pathetic looking. Rice with beans on top of it  and some half-assed salad thing on the other side. Shreds of romaine with some diced tomato. Why even bother  Gimme a pile o  rice and a pile o  beans and I d have been fine. Well sort of fine. The beans were sorta meh. As was the rice. But who cares  The tacos rocked my socks off.   One bite of that stewed pork with cilantro  queso fresco  and diced onion  all wrapped up in a grilled flour tortilla just about made my taste-buds cry. Well not really. But it was some tasty vittles.   The fish taco  I thought was even better. I ordered mine with red cabbage added on for some extra crunch texture  and that was just delicious. Good guac  excellent fish  and tasty pico. It wasn t overly spicy like Torchy s  I know  I know  TORCHy s  it should be hot  but I still think it s overdone. So sue me  . I really liked the flavor play in that taco. It just needed one thing though. A lime wedge. I didn t check if there were any inside  but I honestly think fish tacos should be served with a lime wedge just inherently. Citrus and fish go hand in hand  especially lime and a baha fish taco. But that aside  it was a good taco. Not too fishy  and yet the fish wasn t overwhelmed by toppings either. Well done  Tacodeli.  My dad s Fundido Sirloin was quite tasty  he really enjoyed it. Not my perfect taco  mostly a man dish in my opinion  but good flavor. His Bison was a new flavor for me. I ve never had Bison  but I enjoyed my bite. My mom was a bit surprised by the flavors in her brisket Tacoloco. I think she was expecting more of a smoked brisket flavor   we don t normally have braised brisket   but the flavor was nice. Really greasy and messy though. Be sure to get plenty of napkins and lean forward when you eat that sucker.  So a summary   Don t go if you value personal space or good rice and beans.  Do go if you don t give a damn about either of the above things and you just want a tasty  semi-messy taco. Because that s what these are  and they re pretty cheap too. Bravo Tacodeli.
Tacodeli,345,Excellent classic tacos. Also try there green salsa. Queso isnt bad.. it s very thin. I wish it stayed open pass 3   They also have a good selection veggie tacos
Tacodeli,346,This place is so gooooooood  Excellent organic ingredients and you can really taste the difference in quality. Lotsa vegetarian options. Salsa is fab too. Friendly n fast service but expect a line  the wait wasn t too bad though . Bring the dog  
Tacodeli,347,omgomgomgomg     soooo soooo soooo sooo good    THIS IS LOVE AT FIRST BITE     We ordered the  a href  http   www.yelp.com biz_photos -qjkQHH-5O8BAztc6udOuw select UsJvSL-ZOFNL97hdMK-70Q  yelp.com biz_photos -qjk   a  and  a href  http   www.yelp.com biz_photos -qjkQHH-5O8BAztc6udOuw select qWzO2uWu3c5ong002UyQrQ  yelp.com biz_photos -qjk   a   I loved all and would eat them all again but my favorite favorite was the Frontera Fundido steak  yummmmm  now drooling as I type .  And  with me being me  I obviously had to try ALL kinds of different sauces they have.  I think they have their spiciest sauce in the back.  So  if you like spicy  you will have to ask them directly.  However  although a die hard fan of spicy- ss things  I actually preferred their dona sauce more.  It goes so well with their tacos  I was practically drinking the sauce as I inhaled them tacos.  As for the dip... well  it looked a bit like a mixture of someone else s leftover so I wasn t sure about it... but it is O-SO-GOOD-I-CANNOT-STOP-SHOVING-IT-INTO-MY-MOUTH-EVEN-THOUGH-I-AM-SUPER-STUFFED      Service was quick and everyone was really friendly and easy going.  It was our first time so we had a lot of questions  but they were patient and we didn t feel rushed at all even though the place was super busy.  On top of that  they offered us 3 fresh bags of chips to take out with our left over dip.  How sweet is that   Only complaint  Oh   dear Tacodeli  why o why are thou hours so short     What do I do now if I have taco craving after 3pm 
Tacodeli,348,How have I never written a review for this place   Tacodeli  I love you.  My family loves you.  My cats would probably love you if they got to eat your food.  You are  quite simply  the best.  Go on Thursdays for scallop day.  Just go.    Or go any other day.  I usually get the mojo fish and the cowboy taco  but everything I ve ever had has been fantastic.  Just be sure to call ahead if you re in a hurry.  Because I m not the only one obsessed with this place.  Yum 
Tacodeli,349,I want my time and my appetite back   This is a review of the breakfast tacos.  This is something our mom would attempt to make  is how my brother referred to the taste.   When you start thinking about what you want for lunch halfway through your breakfast  there s a sign that you ve ruined your appetite with the amazing food Austin has to offer.   The best breakfast taco  out of three places I visited  was Torchy s.
Tacodeli,350,Food is 4.5 but it s getting bumped to 5 for service. We came on a busy Sunday  moved to the side since we needed to figure out what we wanted  and the cashier actually came out from behind   I heard you said this was your first time  what interests you   . We ended up going with his recommendation  and at the last second adding another taco since we weren t sure it was enough food. Went with cowboy and space cowboy  vegetarian  and migas. Honestly  migas  our choice  wasn t bad  but didn t hold a candle to his recommendation  including adding the hot sauces  Dona with habanero because we like heat . Soooooooooooo good. Meat was very well seasoned according to the hubs  and I ve never had a more flavorful portabello- so nice to find a place were the flavor isn t just in the meat  leaving us vegetarians to figure out how to add flavor ourselves  . Will definitely try to hit this office up again before we leave  Highly recommend 
Tacodeli,351,I enjoyed their breakfast tacos. I only ate one and was satisfied appetite wise. I  love  their assortment of salsas. No need to pick one salsa  just mix em based on the spicy level and BOOM.  I really enjoyed the outdoor patioperfect for dining without the overwhelming heat in the morning.
Tacodeli,352,Best breakfast tacos in Austin   I briefly moved out of town and would always come to Tacodeli the moment I came back to Austin  Their Tacodeli mashed potatoes are my favorite thing to put on my tacos  Everyone must try them 
Tacodeli,353,I would eat here everyday if I could. They have great corn tortillas compared to other Mexican restaurants. The Dona hot sauce is the best hot sauce I ve ever had. My only complaint is that it can take a while to get your order sometimes...but I ll admit the wait is worth it.
Tacodeli,354,Taco Deli is great for breakfast. I had the Migas and Otto. Their Dona sauce is the right amount of spice.
Tacodeli,355,I thought Tacodeli was just okay. Overall the tacos were pretty good  but nothing was really great aside from the Puerco Verde. The Heather  grilled queso fresco  black beans  guac   Tacoloco  brisket barbacoa - REALLY greasy and truly the greasiest taco I ve ever had   and the Otto  beans  bacon  avocado   were all really lackluster. They were big with a lot of fillings  but the flavors just didn t meld.     The Puerco Verde on the other hand was great. The pork was incredibly flavorful and not too greasy and balanced well with the rest of the taco. I would love to sit down with a bowl of the Puerco and just eat that.  I was also bummed that the chips were incredibly stale and the queso was really coagulated. Their honey limeade was pretty good but VERY sweet and I d get a water to go along with it.  There are a lot cheaper taco joints all over Austin - in my opinion Tacodeli is just middle of the road for a little higher price.
Tacodeli,356,Excellent tacos.  Had the vacquero and sirloin taco.   Tender meat and not so spicy sweet peppers.  Now it s a favorite of mine when in Austin.     Love sitting outside.
Tacodeli,357,Rather expensive  usually quite a long wait  and small portion. However  it s Taco Deli  a Austin culture icon.
Tacodeli,358,Tacos are bomb  Got the beef cowboy taco and a chicken One. The chicken was better  meat on th beef was chewy. The flavors and sauces were so good
Tacodeli,359,Great quality food in a very well run setting.  The staff is really friendly  very smart and clearly care about what they re doing.  Not to be missed when in Austin.  My advice  come for a late  light  breakfast  then stay for lunch.  The salsas are perfection  chips also  amp  the guacamole.  Have an  Otto  for breakfast then stay for the additions on the lunch menu and you will be really happy.  SUPERB- not to be missed         
Tacodeli,360,I was only in Texas for a few days and knew I had to get breakfast burritos at least once. This was on the way and it was as good as the hype. The burritos were very good and the sauces  ranging from mild to hot  made the burritos even better. If I get a chance I ll be going back 
Tacodeli,361,I am obsessed with Taco Deli s Roja salsa. I love the Heathers  and other stuff  too. The food is always delicious and the people who work at this location are always super friendly.
Tacodeli,362,This taco joint is ideally located right across the street from the greenbelt trail head.  So  I find myself here at least once a month with my hiking buddies.  The 4 item Breakfast Taco with eggs  beans  cheese and potatoes is the perfect amount of protein and carbs to fuel my hike without putting me in Mexican food coma.  Post hike the Heather and Happy Taco make me darn happy.  And that spicy green sauce knocks my socks off...
Tacodeli,363,Consider me one of the millions on the Tacodeli bandwagon.  This place rules and no amount of good reviews will make up for the first time you experience a basket full of their tacos  rice  and beans.  No frills  rushed but polite counter service  but life changing tacos.  Now  I understand that Mexican and Tex-Mex are HOTLY debated in Austin  justifiably so.  I think there are a lot of really good options and perhaps so many that its better to give them subclassifications.  I would classify Tacodeli as a high-quality counter joint with super low prices.  It is not  I repeat NOT  a classy sit down tablecloth kind of place.  You ll see all walks of life  all breeds of dog  kombucha drinkers  yuppies  everything...and they coexist because Tacodeli rules.   Every time we come to Austin  this is literally the first stop on the trip.  Our garmin has it permanently programmed in the favorites section.  Every time we come I spend 10 minutes panicking about which tacos to order  of the seemingly hundreds of options .  Every time  I pick correctly.  No matter what you order  its going to rule.  That said  my favs are the scallops taco  only on Thursday   the pork mole taco  the frontera fundido sirloin taco  and the rice and beans.  For breakfast  the ranchero taco was pretty killer too.  I have to cut this one short because just writing about Tacodeli makes me wistful about it and without a scheduled Austin trip on my horizons  its just too sad to think about my life without it.
Tacodeli,364,Holy crap their tacos are delicious.  I ve sampled across the menu from beef to bean and every one I ve tried has been nothing short of awesome. You want a quick cheap taco that tastes like a million bucks   These are your guys.
Tacodeli,365,Hey  I really appreciate it they have a outdoor area where I can have my dogs hang out well I eat. I want on Saturday and dad the Fazoli s soup special and the ceviche taco. Both were delicious. The soup was a little salty. Service was prompt and professional. Not bad for a 10 lunch.  I can t believe I wait to so long to try Tacodeli again.
Tacodeli,366,First of all  let me tell you that I am blown away by their customer service  Everyone here is so friendly. My husband and I walked into one right after moving to town just to see what the commotion was about. We had just gotten some JuiceLand and were not very hungry. We just went in to grab a menu and one of the girls called us over. We told her we just moved here and wanted to grab a menu to come back later. She told us we couldn t leave empty handed and gave us some chips and queso  which were delicious    Since then  we have not been able to go back  but my work orders them for delivery for our monthly meetings. I am the receptionist and the delivery guys are always super friendly. Since I am the first to handle the order I always get first pick. Their tacos are so much bigger than other places so I m usually go with just one. I like the Jess Special the best.
Tacodeli,367,The tacos are amazing   Great flavors  tender meat.  Only thing I wish they did was label each taco.  It gets confusing ordering for a group of people.
Tacodeli,368,Coming from San Diego  home of the best Mexican food in the US  I m not sure how TexMex is supposed to taste but if Tacodeli is any indication  I have hope.   The tacos were very different from what I was used to in SD. They didn t have your usual carne asada or pollo asado  but nonetheless very delicious indeed. My friends and i tried an assortment of tacos from  The Cowboy  to their normal fish tacos. My fave was the Cowboy for sure  which was by coincidence their best seller.   Also  their hot sauce was gooood  especially the creamy green one. All tourists need to make this one of their stops.
Tacodeli,369,Best tacos in Austin for breakfast lunch and dinner. Perfect for any preference. Vegetation or meat lover they have a taco to please.  Need a gf option. Yup. Done.  The best part are the variety of sauces.
Tacodeli,370,This is a  must go to lunch spot  when I m working in the Austin office  Their carne Asada tacos are bomb dot com. The banhi mi tacos are equally delicious 
Tacodeli,371,Love the consistency of the meat. Love the habanero salsa. Don t love the new website.  Just get the kinks out.
Tacodeli,372,When I went to Tacodeli I thought for a moment that I had been beamed to Portland to eat at Bund Sandwiches.  The place was really busy.  I ordered a breakfast taco  which was more expensive than what I would have expected for a tortilla with some egg on it.  I did really enjoy the chips and queso.    The service was fine  but I probably would go elsewhere for breakfast.
Tacodeli,373,I love Taco Deli and the only thing that i would change  like others have said  is that they should be open later and offer breakfast tacos all the time. The black bean  potatoes and cheese are so amazing  That s all I can really eat here but I love it and always come back for it  the only place in town that uses mexican mashed potatoes  YUM 
Tacodeli,374,Best Tacos I ve ever had.  Period.  So many choices  so many flavors  so many sauces.  If you haven t been here you re missing out on life  so go now and let your taste buds have a party.
Tacodeli,375,Holy crap  best tacos I ve ever had.  I bought these at the Austin farmer s market  5th and Guadalupe or so downtown  on a Saturday morning  and the sticker on the taco wrapping listed the Spyglass address.  Got the breakfast one  which was fantastic  and just for kicks  the bison one.    Holy crap. Bison.  That was amazing.  The meat was super rich and had some sort of magic sauce  including sugar     and the shell was super moist and simply incredible.  Maybe sitting in that warmer kept it moist or made it even extra moist.  Anyway  get the bison and get it with the salsa verde and you ll be super happy.
Tacodeli,376,Favorites were the Papadulce  Freakin Vegan  and Shrimposito. I frequent here a lot and love the tacos  My only recommendation would be to not serve the chips in a plastic bag-it makes it feel like the food isn t fresh.
Tacodeli,377,Yet another overrated restaurant in Austin. The first time I went to Tacodeli I made the mistake of ordering a bean and potato taco. They use mashed potatoes - I m talking box mashed potatoes. It was disgusting. I couldn t even finish it. I went a second time more recently and it was definitely not something I d consider memorable.
Tacodeli,378,I must be getting old  because oh law my patience...  dude  ...and who is picking up this order  me  Dej  D- E- J. dude  Okay cool   inaudible  but it sounds wrong  me  yes  D as in door dude  ohhh DEJ with a D. I put the order in as Bej so they might say that. But it s almost the same thing. me  Yeah  it s  exactly  the same thing.  brain asplodes everywhere   Overall this place is a trip  packed to the gills most lunch hours on workdays. I always place a pick up order because I am not waiting in that line  and Russell is my favoritist dude in the joint. Definitely go for scallop taco Wednesdays  I think Wednesdays  and cochinita pibil Thursdays  I think - just check online day-of . Other go-tos  the portabella fundido and the heather. I m no veggie but these are just good. Their wheat tortillas are slightly nutty and an awesome substitute for flour or corn  their flour is bangin   however .  I did find their Happy Taco  the shredded chicken with yummy sauces  to be less happy down here than it is at their north location  and bigger eaters probably won t make it out of here without a  14ish dent in their wallets  but the flavors are on point. And if you call in your order  just... be named Ana  or Sara  or Mary. Those three Dej letters are all kinds of cryptic and enigmatic.
Tacodeli,379,TOP 3 MUST DOs FOR AUSTIN.  Have heard about it for years... was almost concerned the hype would leave me disappointed... but no the green sauce was as good as they all say    Only down side is that I couldn t try every taco on the menu. They are all so great in their own unique way. Trust the opinion of the staff if you re feeling overwhelmed   also byob  im pretty sure all locations maybe just this one   we rolled up w  a cooler of beers after our day on the river.
Tacodeli,380,After trying Tacodeli for the first time  I was very impressed by the expansive taco tortas breakfast taco menu they have. In addition  they sell Holy Cacao cake balls which are to-die-for.   I ordered the Puerco Verde taco which was pretty good. It s a tender pork taco w  the works  onions  cilantro  etc.  and tomatillo sauce  but I still think Torchy s Green Chile Pork Taco is much better.  I didn t have a chance to try their queso or breakfast tacos ... but for now I think I ll stick to Torchy s just because it s more convenient and as for now  I like it better.  I also want to add that their Dona Sauce  the creamy green one   is not as spicy as the ones in East Austin at taco stands ... it doesn t even stand a chance against those when it comes to levels of spiciness.
Tacodeli,381,Ok  I might ruffle some feathers with this one  but I was not impressed with TacoDeli. Here is what I did like about it   The staff  The dude behind the counter was awesome  Super helpful  it was my first time there  and very relaxed. Not the pushy salesman type. This is the reason for the 3 stars.  The coffee  The coffee was delicious.  You add your own cream and sugar  which I actually prefer.    The queso   White queso   very creamy with good flavor.  Here is what I didn t like   The tacos  Yea  I didn t like the tacos at TacoDeli.  I had The Jess breakfast taco and it was bland and kinda cold. I usually love breakfast tacos  so I was shocked when I discovered mine was absolutely smothered in jack cheese and didn t taste good at all. I opted for a second taco as well  and was disappointed with it too  I would choose Torchy s over TacoDeli any day.  However   I do plan to give it one more go. I plan on heading back for some lunch tacos to give it a second chance  coulda been an off day who knows.
Tacodeli,382,Had to try this place out after hearing people compare it to one of my favorites- Torchy s. Tacos were average  nothing very unique or amazing. The sauce selection is decent. Definitely will be sticking to Torchy s from here on out. Also has super strange hours and closes at 3pm everyday.
Tacodeli,383,We tried tacodeli based on yelp reviews during our first trip to Austin.  You can t go wrong here.  Amazing food  friendly staff  clean and friendly atmosphere.  We came back two days in a row bc we loved it so much.  We ordered different tacos each time and we loved them all 
Tacodeli,384,It matters not if the exterior is soft  crunchy  flour or corn  for God created all tacos equal. It is the internal qualifications that make a taco stand out. This wierd Austin little taco joint does a find job bringing equality in the love each delicious taco. You can just feel it. I ll be back.
Tacodeli,385,Pretty good street taco chain. Not my favorite but the variety is good and the service was great. Lots of hot hipster men working there which is fun - ha  All their salsa were great from the rojo  verde  jalape o and habanero.   Would go back every once and a while but Torchy s is better in my humble opinion.
Tacodeli,386,We lived in Austin years ago when we discovered Taco Deli. Before foodies. Before food trucks. Before Austin was so cool. I don t live in Texas anymore  and this is hands down one of the top things I miss. I even had a friend overnight me salsa once. Yeas  it was worth it. Needless to say  it s busy and crowded  so just expect that before you show up. The food comes out relatively fast considering how many people are waiting. We had a variety of tacos  every one was delicious. Hats off to a place that has stayed true to its food for longer than most places have been in business. I ll absolutely be back 
Tacodeli,387,We stumbled across this place on our visit to Austin  and I m beyond glad we did   Amazing tacos - I ordered 2 of the Cowboy Tacos  and the were divine  Beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection   amp  the rest of the ingredients really complimented each other   Can t say much else because we just grabbed a quick bite and didn t order much else off the menu  but the lines are out the door  and the food is fantastic 
Tacodeli,388,This place is the spot. Very quality ingredients. I ve tried almost every taco on the menu. Haven t found one that hasn t left me impressed  
Tacodeli,389,Absolutely the best fresh tacos I ve ever had.  I encourage anyone to try this little place.  You won t be disappointed.
Tacodeli,390,I can brag about Tacodeli all day.  I was in Austin all throughout undergrad and I am in love with this place.  I have been to 2 locations and they were both great.  The one complaint I have is that they definitely need to be open later than 2-3 pm  people want tacos at all hours of the day   I have tried most of the non seafood tacos and they were all amazing.  What makes it even better is the green Dona sauce.  I would buy a gallon of it if I could 
Tacodeli,391,Awesome   Tons of vegetarian options.  Customer service was the bomb.  Queso is a must   Will be back
Tacodeli,392,went to taco deli in may of last year and absolutely loved it. The staff was super friendly and I really enjoyed their breakfast burritos. There is also a sweet little walk along the green belt right across the street.
Tacodeli,393,When I lived on Barton Skyway  I called this place Yuppie Tacos because  seriously  just look at their clientele.   This is how my experience with Tacodeli would go   Man  I m up really early and the bus doesn t come for another 30 minutes. I could get some breakfast. Tacodeli is pretty much my only option  though. Do I want to give them another try  Okay  let s do it.  I would then order my tacos  load up on salsa  ride the two buses to UT  and eat the tacos in my first class.   Every time  without fail  I would think   These really aren t that good  given how much I paid for them.  The salsas are pretty great and dousing my taco in salsa made it somewhat palatable. I would even mix it up and get different tacos  thinking maybe the ones I ordered previously weren t the best they had to offer. The conclusion was always nope  these just kind of stink.   So  let me just break it down for you. I lived on Barton Skyway for two years and I was on the greenbelt damn near every day  meaning I saw the line at Tacodeli damn near every day. The only people who eat here and enjoy it are yuppie ass white people. There s just no other way to say it. Rarely would I see someone who didn t fit into that category  and I always assumed they forgot to eat before a day of hiking  so they reluctantly stopped at Tacodeli to wait in some ridiculously long line for mediocre tacos.   If Tacos for White People  is your thing  then  by all means  eat to your heart s content. Clearly  you re going to do it anyway  because this place is still in business. I also like to call this place Tacos for the Uneducated .   This establishment does sell greenbelt trail maps  though  and I think that s pretty cool. Here  have another star  Tacodeli. See  I m not totally mean.
Tacodeli,394,Once I found this place I was hooked  Like eat here twice a week hooked. Great menu  usually a 15 min wait to order at the countering the weekends. They close early. Parking and seating is limited.   I got severe food poisoning off the picadillo taco and have not been back since.
Tacodeli,395,Maybe it s the novelty  but I d say it s better than Torchy s. As at Torchy s the tacos are hip  imaginative  and not cheap. We intended to run here on the Greenbelt from Hill of Life for breakfast  but we got lost and ended up driving here for lunch. I enjoyed the Cowboy and Pollo Fantastico tacos. I saw somewhere that Texas Monthly named the Cowboy best taco. But if beef isn t your thing they have tacos for just about any diet. The guacamole is creamy  limey  and pricey but good. They have Maine Root sodas and several aguas frescas.
Tacodeli,396,This is the best Tex Mex restaurant ever created. I always get the Cowboy taco  one of there others  you cannot go wrong   and a Mexican Coke. The outdoor seating is great  especially by the benches on the side. Don t forget to order queso   Side note  If you are getting breakfast  the Otto is the best taco.
Tacodeli,397,Do a  Do a  Habinero sauce   Do a  Do a  Habinero sauce   I could just stop with that but seriously folks.  The tacos at this place all have their own style.  Scallop tacos  ceviche tacos  mole tacos  poblano tacos   It s nice to be able to eat at the same place every day and not have anything that tastes the same.  Great for both carnivores and vegetarians.  A must for an iconic Austin lunch experience.
Tacodeli,398,The line can be long but call ahead and order. Their food is worth it 
Tacodeli,399,This is one of the best places to eat in Texas. I ve been coming for over 10 years now. Location is great  seating is mainly out doors with shaded spots next to building  staff is friendly  and efficient. Does get busy during peak lunch times  but what would you expect from one of the most popular places in town.  My favorites are  Beef Fundido Chicken Fundido Cowboy Cowgirl - not on menu  it is s cowboy with chicken.  All the breakfast tacos. The queso  amp  guacamole are fantastic. Last  the roja  amp  donna  green hot one  caution - not guacamole  sauces are perfect.
Tacodeli,400,By far the beat breakfast taco place that I have encountered.  The Otto  is my favorite  but I have found that you can t go wrong. The location near Zilker park is the original and the coolest. However  the flavor and quality is consistent at all locations in Austin and Houston.
Tacodeli,401,Hands down  the best fish tacos I have tried.  Beats Torchy s but only by a bit. Love the pork belly tacos too.
Tacodeli,402,I visited a Taco Deli location for the first time this past week.  I was appalled by the individual serving packaging of tortilla chips.  If chips are put into these bags when warm  chemicals from the plastic film are leeching into the chips.  In addition  this film is headed straight for the landfill - it cannot be recycled.  I ate at the restaurant and was served food on a paper plate with a plastic fork and a plastic cup for drinks.  It is time to transition to reusable dishware when possible.  Please consider being more conscious of the waste you produce and the impact you have on the environment.
Tacodeli,403,Omg...this place is sooo good   Loved it  loved it  loved it    Staff was also very friendly. I would definitely come back if I m in Austin again 
Tacodeli,404,Stopped at this place for breakfast.  There was a long line  but it moved quickly.  The staff was very friendly.  They had lots of veggie options - which I found very appealing     The eggs were from organic cage free chicken which made my heart happy too     The food was oh so very yummy   Some of the best black beans ever.  Do not pass this place up    Tacodeli - YOU ROCK  
Tacodeli,405,First time is good...second time I realized it s just a hyped taco place.   The tacos I ordered where not warm  amount was not great  sauce containers are tiny  line is long  not enough sitting  waiting time is huge  their recommended  picosito  taco bitter.... like coffee. I never in my mexi-life have left a taco. Taco-delis picosito was my first time. The amount paid was double compared to other places like Torchis. I give them the thumbs up for presentation. That s it.   Pd  I m Mexican  so I have higher standards.
Tacodeli,406,The tacos here are amazing  The queso is a must and always just ask for recommendations  Be ready however to wait as it s really popular but worth the wait. Make sure to grab the salsas also 
Tacodeli,407,I was told by a few people that tacodeli is the best fresh taco in Austin. It was great.  I got a few different kinds  the catfish  the fish and the pork  all were great.  The atmosphere is nice too  lots of dogs and a nice outdoor seating area.   Being from new england  this is everything you want in a taco stand.
Tacodeli,408,Quick  cheap  and delicious  We stopped in for breakfast  it s a great little spot to start your day. I highly recommend the Otto with an egg  it s a decent size taco  two would be more than enough. Definitely try all the salsas and grab a seat on the patio  a really nice way to start the day 
Tacodeli,409,Consistently good  interesting  fresh and well prepared tacos.  Their salsas are awesome  the variety of tacos is great.  The tacos are good-sized  and you can fill up on two or three for a few bucks each.  One of the women in our office says that they have the hottest waiters  too  but that s not my call to make.
Tacodeli,410,I forgot to breathe.  Get the Akaushi Picadillo or the Cowboy Taco. Freakin  Vegan is amazing too. Award-winning salsas and queso.
Tacodeli,411,I absolutely love this place. Texas has some of the best Tex Mex Mexican food I have ever had. I would eat here and unfortunately gain a lot of weight if I lived here because I would go all the time.   The first time I had it a few years ago  I couldn t remember what I got  but it was good. I ve also had the yummy shrimp taco before. Most recently  I tried the cowboy taco  tacoloco  and Akaushi picadillo based on recommendations from the nice cashier. I was very full  and my favorite was the cowboy taco.The tacoloco and Akaushi picadillo were good as well  but I d probably like to try other tacos next time.
Tacodeli,412,Everyone was delicious  Except the guacamole. Unfortunately it was so spicy that I couldn t even eat any of it  Such a waste of my money on something that wasn t listed as spicy  And it was on a taco so I couldn t eat that
Tacodeli,413,I come here 1-2 times a week and thoroughly enjoy it every time. Everything about it is great  the food  the service and the ambiance. The Cowboy is one of the best tacos I ve ever had but just about everything on the menu is really good.
Tacodeli,414,4 stars. Ordered the Jess special  eggs  cheese and avocado  and the sirloin  egg and cheese taco. Both were very good breakfast tacos and the ingredients were super fresh. There were also 4 types of fresh salsa from mild to real hot to choose from. Service was great too and tied sweet leaf tea for the first time and it was great.
Tacodeli,415,Great tacos and quick service. The queso and guacamole were both delicious   The cowboy taco was a table favorite.
Tacodeli,416,Taco Deli is climbing up my list of places I enjoy going.  Just a year or two ago  all I saw was overpriced tacos  long lines  and enough hipsters to push me back to the barrio for my tacos. I work just down Mopac near 360  and Taco Deli has been the only choice to make occasionally.  That or Abuelos.  I ll go wait in line at Taco Deli before I ll go to Abuelos. The Otto is awesome.  Good al pastor.  Sometimes I m not a fan of their specialty breakfast tacos.  I m no longer a reluctant customer  but glad to go.  It s a fun  easy place to have a quick morning offsite meeting.  And they still have kombucha.
Tacodeli,417,Great tacos  always the best place to stop after our sunday rides.  They have picnic tables outside and its BYOB  so a cold beer is the perfect compliment to their tacos.  The Cowboy  Puerco Verde and Mojo Fish tacos are all great.  The Poblano pepper taco can be great or just OK depending on the day  I wish I knew the secret code to figure out this one. 
Tacodeli,418,This is by far the best taco place I have ever been to.  I went here over a year ago and was looking at their menu to recall what I ordered and I started drooling.  I recall ordering at the least Cowboy Taco and Tacoloco  which were awesome      I was in taco heaven.  I don t think I ve been disappointed with any of their tacos.  I recall coming here several times within a weekend in Austin when I was last there for SXSW.  Awesome 
Tacodeli,419, Vegetarian   BEST breakfast tacos ever. First morning stop everytime I come back to Austin.  Order  Jess Special  Migas  WITH black beans and papas  or just plain old custom with papas  black beans  and cheese  NOM . Also  load up on their famous salsas   While this place gets packed on weekends  it actually isn t hard to find seating  with space heaters in the winter  outside and food comes out in less than 10 minutes.  Tip  Order by phone when you are on your way for take-out  will be ready to eat by the time you get there 
Tacodeli,420,Consistently good tacos. Both breakfast and lunch dinner. 2-3 tacos usually does the trick. Everything on the menu I d say is worth trying. The place gets pretty crowded and the line can be bothersome  but they do their best to churn thru it.
Tacodeli,421,Tacodeli has 5 stores across Austin  TX. This is the original Tacodeli location started back in 1999. From all the different styles of tacos I have tried across the USA  Tacodeli is the best taco spot in this country. Certainly this is one bold claim  esp with the huge amount of taco and TexMex places across Austin.  I still stand by it.    I have been going to Tacodeli for over a decade now. I have also taken many friends visiting Austin to this place. Location is off Barton Skyway on South Mopac at intersection of Spyglass Rd. It is right next to the Greenbelt trails in South Austin. Tacodeli is open every day  7am-3pm weekdays  8am-3pm weekends. Plenty of parking on the street if the lot is full. This is the smallest venue of stores  has small indoor seating and mostly outside patio seating. Nearly all ingredients on Tacodeli come from farms in the Austin area or just outside the city. You can tell there is an extreme fresh preparation of their vegetables served with all their tacos.    There are several reasons why I put Tacodeli in such high standing. First  you have a such a wide variety menu options.  You can get many different tacos for beef  chicken  pork  fish  shrimp  breakfast or veggie tacos. One cool thing about the breakfast tacos you can simply build your own.  Tacodeli also have a great variety of salsa  fresh soup  and salads.  You can order any 2 tacos and make it a plate with rice and beans. You can get tacos on your choice of flour  corn or wheat tortilla. Tacos average between  3-4 each and two usually will fill a normal person up.   Tacodeli has a weekly rotation of specialty tacos that are also added to the daily menu.  Sooooooo many tacos to mention  so I will try to get through many as I can Cowboy taco  overnight seasoned run on steak sirloin  mixed with guacamole  grilled peppers  amp  onions  roasted corn and queso fresco served on top.  Their signature taco.   Frontera Fundido  Steak chicken or pork. Top with green bell peppers and onions  with a thin melted cheese glaze on top. Delicious  Banh Mi  Tues only   This might be my favorite of all. Marinated pork shoulder  carrots  basil  amp  cilantro  in a fantastic green chilie tomatillo sauce.  Just too good. Chile Relleno  Wed only   A spicy messy shredded pibli pork in a orange ancho pepper sauce.  Served in a roasted poblano pepper top with purple onions  amp  queso fresco.   Scallop  Thu only   Grilled scallops  with a mix of poblano  amp  red peppers and a garlic lime mojo sauce. Otto taco  breakfast   no eggs  Refried black beans  crispy bacon  avocado topped with monterrey jack cheese.  Boom  Al Pastor  Marinated pork with their house made adobo sauce.  Topped with guajillo peppers  cilantro  amp  onions.  El Picosito  Now served daily  thin diced beef tenderloin in a unique spicy chipotle sauces  topped with avocado  amp  quest fresco. Bold flavor.      The house made sauces are one of the staples of this great restaurant. Verde is a mild green salsa.  Roja is their version of red salsa with great smokey tomato flavor  mixed with serranos  onions and garlic.  The next two sauces are on their own level.  The orange habanero salsa is true fire. It gives you that 5 second burn delay by putting it on a chip. This is quite a powerful spicy flavor and it the hottest stuff they got.  Finally the king of all is their famous Dona sauce.  It is a thick green spicy sauce that you just want on everything. Dona is their signature sauce with an unmatched spicy flavor. You can always order chips  amp  salsa   2.50  and get unlimited refills on chips.  Get as much as you want at the salsa bar.    Tacodeli also does catering and large to go orders. Many people will bulk order breakfast tacos for their office or hire for a function.  You can also place to go orders on the phone to skip the line.  Now Tacodeli certainly is a popular place so don t be surprised if you get there at primetime lunch hour and a line is out the door.  Usually the line moves fairly quickly and the food wait time is about 10-15min. Just call in an order if you are in a rush.  You can skip the line and go to the to go order pickup inside.    I would hope any local Austin resident has been here. Any tourist in Austin should certainly make Tacodeli one of the places on their food checklist for the huge variety in this city. The great selection of tacos  amazing flavors   amp  friendly service make this one of the best restaurants for Austin.  A true local gem.
Tacodeli,422,I usually love Tacodeli. Up until today  they ve been consistently great. However  today felt like I had gone to a different establishment. I called ahead to place my order  cause I know how busy they are on Sundays   and the person on the phone said it d be ready in 20 mins. Fair enough. I showed up around 20 mins after I placed the order and when I paid for it  the lady said it d be out shortly. Well  I waited another 25 mins  a total of 45 mins  and my order finally came out. To be fair  the lady was apologetic about the extra long wait and offered complimentary chips  which I declined.   All that would ve been fine  except when I finally got the tacos and sat down to eat  they were cold. Felt like I was eating unheated leftovers. I was very hungry and decided not to deal with the hassle of bringing it up to the lady and having to wait even longer for them to reheat them or give a replacement order.   Something was up with the management   kitchen   workflow today  because I saw a lot of other long faces waiting for their orders too.  Will try them again. Hope today was just a fluke...
Tacodeli,423,I stand corrected. Ordered the Otto breakfast taco this morning and it was out of this world. The bacon... I know just about EVERYONE LOVES BACON but the bacon in this taco was incredible. Perfectly crispy  juicy  and salty  in that order .   Maybe they were just having an off day the last time we went. Even the BF agreed that today s tacos were far better. I misjudged you Tacodeli 
Tacodeli,424,Tacos were amazing  Probably the best chips and queso I have had. Queso is runny but I liked that. I wish the al pastor was chopped into smaller pieces  but I liked it. I highly recommend this place 
Tacodeli,425,LOVE TACODELI  This trip I picked up a dozen or so tacos for a customer of mine  I m always welcomed when I arrive with a Tacodeli bag filled with their delicious treats. I m a huge fan of breakfast tacos  but their lunch tacos rock too 
Tacodeli,426,Oh my Tacodeli. You know I love you  A regular rotation with that freakin  Donna sauce it is like Mexican wababi and those Mexican potatoes. My favorite thing lately is the bison taco. Amazingly good.   My fav place for people watching on weekends.
Tacodeli,427,THE BEST PLACE TO EAT IN AUSTIN     Who s the dumb dumb who gave my heavenly restaurant a bad review    Salsa Roj . Could drink it from a pint glass. Salsa Do a. I could bathe in it.   Otto taco add egg.   Delibelly.   Chicken Mol .   Damn. I m hungry now.   Thanks for everything Tacodeli. I love you
Tacodeli,428,Finally got to order off the non-egg menu today  every damn time I ve come here in search of tacos of the not-breakfast variety I ve been told they re only serving breakfast . I used to work at a coffee shop that sold TD s breakfast tacos  so I ve tried them all a zillion times.  First off  they re good. But they aren t worth the expense. Over  20 for three tacos  chips queso and a coffee. No  thanks.  Also  the al pastor taco is not up to snuff. Fatty hunks of pork and no trace of the pineapple required for a true al pastor taco.  Great service and good people. And super-convenient after a jog or jaunt on this stretch of the Greenbelt. But in a town full of taco options  this place just isn t worth it.
Tacodeli,429,Hanger Steak and the Deli Belly specials are the best tacos here. They have an awesome selection on Kombucha as well. Best tacos in Austin and I m a native.
Tacodeli,430,I can t not give this place 5 stars   I ve only eaten breakfast there  but I have tried over half a dozen different breakfast tacos  and all are tremendous   Fast  delicious  and worth every penny   If you are near one and want a fast  healthy breakfast taco - there is NO WAY to go wrong with Tacodeli 
Tacodeli,431,This is my favorite Tacodeli. They are very    personable and super nice. Everyone seems to be excited to talk to the customers and to make sure everything is ok. The store is super clean   
Tacodeli,432,There are a thousand reasons to love TD. The customer service is the best in town.  Also  and aside from the fact that these are the best tasting tacos in town  I can make healthier choices here   and not miss out on taste  Another reason  The salsas. La Dona is the glorious icing on the taco. The Habanero sauce  better than a  shot of espresso to snap you out of the morning haze. Nothing  in my book  compares to Tacodeli   See you tomorrow  
Tacodeli,433,I  looove taco deli  The Spyglass location is a great spot  but the interior was a bit squished and the staff wasn t as friendly as at other locations. The food is A1 though.
Tacodeli,434,Supper yummy. Vegetarian tacos I felt were well overpriced but they were delicious. The kiddos ate everything up and enjoyed the atmosphere. It gets way overstuffed for the space at times. The sodas are really awesome.
Tacodeli,435,I had breakfast tacos here for the first time  and mistakenly I ordered the potato as one of the three fillers. The guy mention the potato wasn t the normal fried potatoes that you get else where. He looked like he was warning me  but I didn t take the hint and said it was okay.   After a few minutes  I got my tacos....   What kind of perverts put watery instant mash in breakfast tacos    I have a friend that once found a band aid in her taco from Taco Cabana. I imagine my face was similar to hers  when I found out that a tacodeli staff member desecrated my breakfast tacos.
Tacodeli,436,Good tacos. Fresh tasting ingredients. I ordered kind of randomly  a taco with salmon  and 2 chicken. One chicken taco was the pollo fantastico  and I liked that one best. They have specialty sauces. I liked the habanero one.
Tacodeli,437,Basically this location is primarily great for call-in orders  the size of the location is tiny.... Granted its due to the size of the building  which is nobody fault. Though it leaves many people just standing around on a weekend saying UGH where do I stand.... Because I know  I ve cold shoulder plenty of people make my way thru the crowd to To-Go line.  Love the fact I m able to get breakfast tacos served on the weekend till 3pm  and refried black bean tacos on corn... So yummy with Dona salsa.  But seriously  my question is WHAT S WITH THE FREAKING MASHED POTATOES    You make salsa and tacos  why can t your papas  be regular papas     Who the hell seriously likes your mashed potatoes BRO  No joke  Okay done with that  got it off my chest. See you guys next Saturday
Tacodeli,438,Tried at 5 different taco places in Austin over a 3 day weekend - this was our favorite by far. A few things make the place standout  1. There are a lot of option with something for everyone. Lots of vegetarian options too. 2. Every taco is different. This seems obvious but a lot of places we ate at every taco got the same treatment - same onion  cilantro and cheese. At tacodeli every taco had its own flavor and texture combination. 3. While their salasas are amazing  the tacos were well seasoned and you could enjoy them equally without the salsa. You wouldn t. But you could. Which tells you that the ingredients are high quality and flavors are honest. 4. The location is nice. Lots of parking. Lots of outdoor seating. A trail close by to go walk off some calories. What more can you ask for  PS  this is the only place we went back to for one final taco meal. Yes it s not a food truck and they ve got multiple locations so it s not a true Austin experience for some. Was amazing for us  
Tacodeli,439,This place can totally make your day. Fantastic coffee  top-notch tacos  and the friendliest crew in Austin  The Popeye and Mojo tacos are my faves.
Tacodeli,440,Tacodeli  Izzoz  or Torchy s    On any given day  these  artisan  taco joints are all solid choices and similar in price and their uniquely-creative offerings.  This Tacodeli is practically hidden within a multi-family residential area  but once you find it  it really delivers with some cool and funky offerings.  We had the Heather  Chicken Mole  Cowboy and some fish tacos.  We also enjoyed their slightly  puffy  chips  not a bad thing   with most of their salsas.  YUM    Now the  64K question....if I found myself closer to South 1st  would I drive over to Tacodeli in lieu of Izzoz or Torchy s   Probably not but hey  it s all good amigo 
Tacodeli,441,I m a huge fan of Taco Deli tacos. I really wish I was able to get here more often and really  really really wish there was an additional location closer to my world of 04 on Lamar. Do we really need that  game over stop play who s turn  crap that takes up the best place ever for a Taco Deli  No. I love sitting outside after a hike up the GreenBelt and having a Deli Belly. I also love to hunt down Deli Bellys.....do you know  they really don t have them that often. There is a secret farmers market that always has them on Sat. I love the thrill.   The tacos are amazing  the staff is friendly  and...oddly hott. Who are these tall hot guys always at Taco Deli  I think it s just a win win for all in Austin. THIS is why I love it here.
Tacodeli,442,Nothing here is complete without a healthy dose of dona sauce. I love it so much I find myself drinking it while I wait for my food to come out. I wish I could buy it by the liter and eat it with a spoon. I would consider marrying whomever holds the recipe and then force them to make it for me EVERY DAY. Seriously.   The tacos  which are secondary to me at this point  are nicely done. Nothing is ever dripping with grease. The bacon is always perfectly crispy. I like the Otto  which comes with beans  bacon  and avocado  and the Adobados. The quality of the food is high. This location gets major bonus points for being located right by an entrance to the Greenbelt.   The only thing I dislike about TacoDeli is that they close at 3.
Tacodeli,443,I ve lived across the street from this Tacodeli for almost two years now and probably eat there at least once a month. It s good  but unfortunately it s not consistently good. Some days their tacos will be fresh and on point  while other times they re mediocre. The Dona sauce is usually delicious  but only on some days - other times its bland and clearly not made correctly.  Add that to the fact that they re fairly pricey and the insane lines on the weekend  and it s just not somewhere I d want to go more than every once in a while.
Tacodeli,444,It was good. Many trips will be done to complete my gastronomical review of the large menu. A very Austin place  quite fun.
Tacodeli,445,Seriously  taco deli is life. I ve been there twice in the past two weeks alone. It s so fresh and so authentic  And yes  I say authentic which means something coming from a Mexican woman   The tacos are all so unique and you can tell they take pride in making them just right for their customers  In fact  I might just stop by tommorow  Overall  I highly recommend if you re a taco lover such as myself  If I had to choose  I d say the lunch ones are considerably better but I suppose it s just because I think breakfast tacos can get boring  The only complaint I have is the obnoxious birds outside that swoop down like 3 inches over your head every 5 seconds and the birds on the floor that harass you for food.
Tacodeli,446,Some of my favorite breakfast taco s in Austin.  We have a recurring order with them once a month for our entire office and they re always on time  always hot and always delicious.  Thank you Taco Deli for never disappointing with your sirloin and egg on my favorite Tuesday of the month 
Tacodeli,447,Tacodeli at Spyglass catered breakfast and lunch tacos for my post-wedding Sunday brunch. I worked with Brady on the order  and he was very attentive to detail  making sure all of my requests were fulfilled and that I was getting everything I wanted for the lowest cost possible. I had a rather large order and a remote delivery location  but Tacodeli rose to the challenge  Delivery went smoothly  the food was absolutely delicious  and I got so many compliments from my guests  If you need tacos catered  you should make Tacodeli your first call. I m so glad I have a location near me so I can eat these delicious tacos anytime I want 
Tacodeli,448,Very creative taco choices  with a number of veggie choices.  I had the freaky vegan and the one with sweet potato whose name I don t remember  and both were fabulous.  Also loved the salsa verde  mmmmmmmm.    I wish there was more indoor seating  it was a little chilly to sit outdoors  but the food made it worthwhile.  I m going to try some of their other locations now 
Tacodeli,449,TOP NOTCH   Without a doubt some of the best taco s I ve ever had anywhere.  Carne Asada  and Happy Taco....nuff said......
Tacodeli,450,There are tons of taco spots in Austin and everyone will tell you they know the best one.  Unless they re talking about Taco Deli... they re lying     They have homemade queso  probably the best queso I ve ever had.  So good  you can eat it with a spoon.  The taco s are super delicious  I went back to days in a row to get more.  If you re in Austin  you have to go to Taco Deli.  It s also right by the Green Belt where you can go hike or hang out by the river before or after you eat.  The line moves quick and the wait staff is very friendly.
Tacodeli,451,So excited about the expansion they made   Best taco s in town...friendly service...salsa is over the top good...Even if there s a line it flows quickly  This is the original taco stop in Austin  
Tacodeli,452,Love this place for my breakfast taco fix  So glad it s not too close to my house  or I d be in bad shape.  I ve tried multiple things here  but my go-tos are the migas taco and jess special  They typically have taco of the month specials and any of those are delicious too  I need to be better at trying other tacos  but I just want my fix sometimes  The chips and salsa are so perfect  I could munch on those all day.  I wish they sold their salsas  because I would buy those in a heartbeat   Keep in mind there are several locations to get your fix too  This one gets pretty crowded  especially since it s to an entrance of the greenbelt.  As all Austin hot spots go  there will always be a line   
Tacodeli,453,All I can say is when you order the wrong thing and LOVE it  it shows how good taco deli is. For breakfast  the Jess special and sirloin and egg are my go to tacos. I just feel ready for the day after those tacos. And unlike the  other  place  Tacodeli lets you choose one or all of their sauces  which I like all four.  Tacodeli for breakfast and lunch on same day. I wish they were open for dinner.
Tacodeli,454,Ate here for the first time today.  The tacos where amazing   We got a brisket taco and 2 types of chicken tacos.  The queso was great.  They give you a lot of chips with an order of the dips.    They have several local drinks in the fountain which was really neat.  The staff is fast and makes up for the long line and public running around like crazed ants.
Tacodeli,455,I love Taco Deli  The service is always quick and friendly. The food is delicious  I am not even a vegetarian  and my favorite taco is The Freakin  Vegan. The way they cook and smash up the black beans is just perfect. I love that they have slices of fresh avocado on them    At this location  lunchtime can get pretty busy. There is limited parking and also limited seating. The line can get long  so be prepared to wait. But I don t complain  because the food and the experience is always worth it 
Tacodeli,456,Not what I expected......my migas didn t even have corn tortillas in it  weird. Definitely very Tex-mex.
Tacodeli,457,The hanger steak taco special on Mondays is a work of art. It s up there with the Sistine Chapel  the first season of Rick and Morty  and the second season of Rick and Morty. I was full but I ordered a second one anyways. Everyone from Austin told me to check this place out and they did not steer me wrong. Tacodeli is just one of the many reasons that Austin Mexican food trumps every other city in the USA  that I ve been to .
Tacodeli,458,Tacos are good but no way the best in Austin. Corn tortillas are store bought and does not taste authentic. The beef is tasty but not the best by a long shot. Salsas are also just okay. If you are used to great tasting authentic tacos you will be very disappointed eating here. The cowboy taco is also not the best in Texas. Whoever voted that should have their taco tasting license revoked.
Tacodeli,459,Delicious  fresh  so many combinations of their tasty sauces  fresh veggies  meats and tortillas. A significant. Real fast taco menu in addition to the impressive lunch menu. Can t go wrong here  and you won t regret it afterward. Also  alternative soda fountain brands and daily agua Frescas. Nom nom.
Tacodeli,460,Love this place so much   Such awesome flavors. Something for everybody. And the locally Austin brewed Kombucha is a definite must-try. Especially the honey Basil 
Tacodeli,461,What a great little spot  I had eaten here years back when going to the greenbelt but it s been a long time ago. We had an hour to kill before an appointment close by so decided  why not grab an early lunch 11am  . I had their special taco  some picadillo with what looked like pine nuts but red  and queso on it  amp  stuffed in an Anaheim peeper. I m sure I just butchered the description but holy cow  that was a great taco   I also had their Al Pastor  which I get at every taco place that I can  it was my first love with regards to tacos. It was good  but not the best I ve had. Staff was super friendly. Our chips queso arrived after the tacos which was a little bit of a bummer  but that stuff happens. Overall I give praise and look forward to my return trip 
Tacodeli,462,When compared to other fancy taco places it cost a bit more you get a bit less and a bit less tasty it s good but not like other places that can really taco it up
Tacodeli,463,If I could eat Tacodeli everyday  I would. I m in love with all of it. My only complaints are it s a little more expensive than I would like it to be and they close at 3  which I know is because all their ingredients are super fresh  but I would like tacodeli for all three meals of the day .   BOMB.
Tacodeli,464,Excellent Tex Mex taco shop  Got a great selection of various good quality ingredients.   Personal favorites here are the Mojo fish and Fronteras sirloin taco.  They also have a nice patio eating area right outside  and it s a pleasant place to grab lunch.
Tacodeli,465,I write this review while fending off a gnarly hangover. Being single on Valentine s Day will do that to you and your liver. So I feel like my hangover makes me an expert on breakfast tacos. Because that s what is needed to feel like a normal person again.   I ve read criticisms that the tacos don t provide that proverbial bang for the buck. Those criticisms are correct. But when the Spyglass location is walking distance from my apartment  I ll ignore portion size in order to feel like a normal person again.   Yes  I m going to be referring to my hangover quite a bit.   The breakfast tacos are awesome. The sirloin is great and the mixes incredibly well with  avocado and eggs. Seriously  this is the best thing. Despite their lunchtime tacos skimping on the ingredients  they don t do that with breakfast. And that s appreciated at this moment as I try and feel like a normal person again.  As for the lunchtime tacos  you can t go wrong with the DeliBelly. It s only available on Wednesday and Saturday so plan your trips accordingly.  Sorry to cut this short but I have some tacos to pick up. Gotta feel like a normal person again and all.
Tacodeli,466,I love their breakfast burritos  Every trip to Austin includes the mandatory stop here to get a few of their delicious treats. Their food is always fresh and prepared quickly.
Tacodeli,467,So let me start off by saying that this is probably my favorite food place while I was visiting Austin.  The line was insanely long  like out of the store and curling around the side  but I was assured by some Austin natives that it was well-worth the wait.  They were so right.  We got some queso and guacamole with chips to start.  The guacamole was super fresh and wonderfully seasoned.  The queso was just yummy cheesy goodness.  We ordered about 8 different tacos for 4 people and everything was delicious.  I really can t recall any time in my life where I ve had tacos like this.  These guys know how to do food right - great quality ingredients with perfectly cooked seasoned meat.  My favorite was the ceviche taco which was the special of the day.  Incredibly light and tangy seafood and creamy  delicious guacamole.  I think I just drooled a little thinking about it.
Tacodeli,468,Tacodeli is addictive. Personally  I m a huge fan of their Mojo fish tacos and their breakfast tacos. They have rotating specials so there s always something new to try. I m hooked on their salsas  especially the spicy green one. They have four to choose from  but their tacos are so flavorful that you don t even need them. This place can get packed  so I like to call in and place my order ahead of time. I wish they were open for dinner  but then I might eat there three times a day 
Tacodeli,469,Awesome place  Loved the breakfast Tacos. They are some of the best I have had in a long time  It gets really packed  be sure to get there early 
Tacodeli,470,So delicious    I ve only had the breakfast tacos there so far but I recommend the Otto  I add egg whites  and the jess special. Their sauces are very good as well.
Tacodeli,471,This location is awesome as all of them are. The food is consistent and the customer service is great    .. I have come here a few time already and every time is as good as before. Must try  You want more details then check my other tacodeli reviews.. don t want to repeat myself lol
Tacodeli,472,Yummy  This place was awesome  We walked in and were greeted by a super friendly guy that explained how everything works  what was good  what he recommended  etc.  The food took a little while  but they were packed to the brim.  I had a Frontera Fundido Chicken and a Mole Portobello. Both were amazing. I poured a bunch of the creamy green sauce on my taco without tasting it and it was SUPER spicy  so make sure to taste the sauces.  I also had the smashed black beans and rice...the beans were phenomenal.
Tacodeli,473,You HAVE TO ORDER Frontera Fundido with steak  Whether it s for breakfast or lunch  just do it.  The Otto Special was awesome too as well the Cowboy.   Their weekend pozole was decent but it was more stew-like than I m used to.   The people who work there are all SO nice and the food comes out really fast  which was surprising considering how many people come through.  During my 2.5 days in Austin  I went here twice. With all the other food in Austin  that s saying a lot 
Tacodeli,474,Consistently good tacos but overpriced for what you get.  I have yet to order anything from here that tasted bad or off.  All the ingredients in the tacos I ve tried work surprisingly well together  even if I didn t expect them to.  The sauces they offer are great too.  their green sauce  forgot the name   has just the right amount of kick  while being creamy at the same time.  The service here is good... they maybe a little overzealous in checking up on their customers  though.  Last time we were there  we got asked 5 times over the span of 20 minutes if we were doing okay.  But at least they re very friendly about it.  The place itself is pretty small - especially the inside.  It can get packed when they re busy and you may have a very hard time finding a place to sit.  Also  be sure not to leave your food unattended... the birds around here don t play.
Tacodeli,475, Wow  if you can find this place you should go   I remember saying that to my friends after I moved here and found Tacodeli. The original location is a bit tricky to find and all locations can be a bit tricky to find open  only through lunch  but you ll find here an amazing selection of well-thought-out taco offerings  great salsas  friendly and helpful staff  and incredibly fresh ingredients. Yes  their tacos skew on the expensive and small side  but they are still well worth the cash outlay. I d recommend favorites  but everything here is so good I rarely eat the same thing twice.
Tacodeli,476,After trying  and re-trying  the abominations of Taco deli s tacos at Jo s on South Congress I was hesitant to give it a go at their Spyglass location. Why would I further my carbon footprint just to get another squishy mess of indiscernible ingredients    Then came the day after a whiskey fueled night and the need for some local greasy grub to bring about a new attempt at life. My sister suggested this place and I was too incapacitated to refuse. I am glad that I didn t. The cowboy taco with steak is delicious and their fish tacos are also juicy and fresh. The queso was great and the salsa choice was a nice awakening for my taste buds. Going to go back for sure- just not to the overheated bombs at Jo s.
Tacodeli,477,This place is INSANELY AWESOME ....  After just moving to Austin from  my city by the bay   or the SF Bay  or as those of us who grew up there came to know it  Yay Area   QuestforSix   was craven some  write home about  kind of tacos.  We ll  I ve gone  several times to Torchies  but the  strap you to a chair  cut your ear off while listening to  Stuck in the Middle with You   wasn t the craving I was trying to satisfy. As much as I love eating a taco that s reminiscent of Reservoir Dogs  I was really craving that  chill n with your friends  while putting back a few cold ones  and soaking up some rays  kind of tacos.  Well  let me tell you...  Taco Deli is just the kind of taco for this guy s soul   The tacos are spectacular.  This trip I stuck with the fish  and went for the guacasabi Tuna  Mojo Fish and the Fish Taco.  All we re amazing  though the favorite was hands down the guacasabi...  The spice rub and soy wasabi glaze are what put this one over the top.  The great thing  the place is chill  the tacos are high quality and not over done  and the local ambience is spot on.  My only knock  there aren t enough locations  but then again....  That s part of the whole charm.
Tacodeli,478,The OG taco stand near the green belt. The best taco they offer is  The deli beli  which is only offered on Weds Sat. It is probably one of the best taco s out there.   Otherwise  they are pretty solid. Mole is good  the pork is great. The fish is not the greatest.   Enjoy 
Tacodeli,479,Blechhh....don t get the ceviche tacos  Almost no fish in there--and the little that was there was stringy and unsubstantial. The bulk of the ceviche was made up of onions  peppers and other stuff. With a WHOLE lot of guacamole. You know when you bite into a taco  how you want to main ingredient  in this case tilapia  to be in every bite  Didn t happen.  There was also a black dog hair in the taco when I got it. I thought   ok  kinda gross--but could happen anyplace. I m gonna pick it out and ignore it.  Then I spied another one in  my friend s salsa.  I ll probably end up there again sometime b c my friends love it--but I think this place is overrated.
Tacodeli,480,Great  great tacos. The Mexico City Chicken Taco is currently  and maybe always  at the top of my taco mountain.  the fresh onion and cilantro is just amazing. The Thursday special scallop taco is wonderful and unique.   The roja sauce at Taco Deli is perfect. I find myself pouring copious amounts of it on my tacos  and if I have leftover from takeout  on other foods as well.  My only complaints with regard to Taco Deli are that the employees can sometimes be too casual and that the price is on the premium end for tacos. Still  the worst rating I can give Taco Deli is 4.5 stars  not allowed on Yelp   so I m rounding up to 5 stars based on flavor.
Tacodeli,481,Excellent food. Black beans are the best.   Very convenient if you re hungry after enjoying Greenbelt. Small portions  well priced.
Tacodeli,482,Awesome tacos  cowboy is my fav  and the queso is amazing  Only complaint I have is the size of the building is too small  always very crowded. Nice outdoor picnic seating under the trees.
Tacodeli,483,Best Taco in town.  Hands down.  Quality ingredients seems to be the key.
Tacodeli,484,Visited while they were renovating so they were working out of the food truck but their breakfast tacos were still on point. The place was busy so they seemed a bit scrambled with their lack of space so my order was a little messed up but it s all good. Breakfast tacos seem like such a simple thing but whatever they do - they do right. I tried a build your own with chorizo  cheese  and eggs - simple but delish. I also had the Jess special which was migas cheese avocado - tasty stuff - even though I ordered the Otto - I wasn t going to complain. Definitely try out their salsa too  
Tacodeli,485,Top notch ingredients. Healthy options.  Great for breakfast tacos.  Just be prepared to wait in line.
Tacodeli,486,Not the most atmospheric location  but delicious tacos. Definitely in the top 3 list for breakfast tacos. They have a variety of interesting combinations  like the Jess taco. More than just your traditional bacon  egg and cheese. The tacos are fresh and the perfect size. You can get two and not feel overly stuffed or left still hungry.   It s a great place to bring dogs  but not a great place for a rainy day since most of the seating is outside. I m a big fan for a quick morning meal.
Tacodeli,487,Don t believe the hype. It s passable. But it s all very gentrified. Nothing remarkable. The special of the month was the best of the 10 we tasted. Cochinita pibil  albeit simple amidst a menu rife with avocado  peanut buttery mole sauce  and roasted veg  was also on point.
Tacodeli,488,How have I not reviewed this place   This is hands down my favorite place for tacos in Austin.  I love the variety of salsas and hot sauces they ve got here to make each taco unique.  A favorite of mine is definitely The Cowboy  and even the vegetarian ones here are fantastic and satisfying.  There are quite a few options on the menu  and they all come with some combination of delicious sauces  spice rubs and chiles  and cheeses of which I haven t found any I truly dislike.  The rotating daily taco specials are always good too and they ve got quite a few with seafood options.   Our office semi-frequently gets Taco Deli fajitas  and while I wasn t a huge fan at first as they are quite atypical in terms of the way the fajitas are usually cooked and served  they ve grown on me and are great in their own way.    Prices are reasonable and 3 tacos should do you for a meal. Must try for tacos when in Austin.
Tacodeli,489,Underwhelmed by the hype  the only taco I really enjoyed from this place was the cowboy... thats it. Others are decent but not the great. Its just a convenient location for work
Tacodeli,490,It is my alternative option for lunch if I go to central market
Tacodeli,491,Not my favorite tacos or queso in town  but there is something about tacodeli that is absolutely crave worthy. Love the black refried beans  the happy taco  the cowboy  frontera fundito  and the queso is actually pretty damn good just wish they would give you a larger portion. Its proximity to the greenbelt makes it great choice for breakfast or lunch after a quick hike. Not enough indoor or outdoor seating. Very friendly taco people  and dog friendly. I would go for lunch- the specialty tacos don t get served till 11 and the breakfast tacos are no good imho.
Tacodeli,492,This review is purely based on over the phone conversation I had with Douglas.  I called from Toronto  Canada with hopes of making a delivery for a friend who frequents at this location. I was trying to find out what he likes to order so I can have it delivered to him  surprise . It turns out that he orders what he wants depending on his feel. So Douglas suggested a giftcard instead  gave me just what I needed to know about what my friend can buy with the card.  I could totally sense the atmospheric upbeat joy from Douglas  voice as we conversed  putting me on very quick holds to chat with his co-workers to find out more information for my request.  Great people. Great service. Thank you Douglas 
Tacodeli,493,I love Taco Deli because it has an amazing list of vegetarian options. And the different salsas that you get there are just absolutely delicious.
Tacodeli,494,You wont find your regular cheaply made tacos at Taco Deli. The meat is great quality and delish.  I hade the frontera fundido  one with chicken  one with steak. Both very appetizing. They have daily specials so make sure to check the website to see what the special of the day is.  The only drawback  the quanity of meat. My steak taco had maybe 5 little pieces of steak. So one is not enough. 2 tacos are perfect. Get a side of their chips and salsa and youre good to go.  This location is very popular at lunch time. So if your in a pinch  just call about 10 mins before you want to pick up to skip the line.  Service is quick and friendly and the place has great oitside seating on those beautiful austin days.   Taco deli is a great choice for quality tacos  you ll be pleased you grubbed there.
Tacodeli,495,Ok so I thought that I really like Torchy s Tacos  but this place may have sway me to be a bigger Tacodeli fan. The ingredients are fresh  the tacos are delicious  and there Dona  green sauce  is one of the best hot sauce I ve had on tacos.   It s a little joint but the patio is big enough to not have to scoot for tables. The staff are awesome and the food comes out super quick. I will definitely be frequently Tacodeli more regularly when I come into Austin.
Tacodeli,496,Tacodeli is proof that world class food can be had for under  5.The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable too  Put it on your calendar... the best taco in the known universe is only available 30 days per year at Tacodeli  just like the traditional seasonal interior Mexican dish on which it s based  the  Chile en Nogada  taco. It s their Monthly Special every September. Walnut goat cheese cream sauce over Wagyu picadillo and roasted green chilies  topped with pomegranate seeds.  You can spend  25 at a restaurant this September on a plate of Chili Rellenos en Nogado  but you won t find any as good as Tacodeli s inexpensive version. Even if you re not a big goat cheese fan  like me  its a minor component of the walnut-based sauce  Another rarity comes from the pre-made taco menu found only at Tacodeli s farmers market stalls  but that you can ask for it at other locations    Black Bean  Mexican Mashed Potato and Cheese  taco.  This one can turn a carnivore into a vegetarian. Perfect choice when you re buying extra tacos to warm up the next day.
Tacodeli,497,I don t know what happened to Tacodeli - but the last couple times I came here I was massively underwhelmed. The cowboy taco beef was kinda chewy and overcooked with barely any meat in the taco. Same with the Mojo Fish - just barely any fish in the taco  with the fish being kinda smushy like.
Tacodeli,498,Honestly shocks me to see this pop up on so many taco lists.  I ve been here several times and more recently because of the hype and still the only good thing I ve had is the guac.  They can do guac.  Tacos taste like something I could make in my own kitchen  there s nothing amazing about them to me.
Tacodeli,499,Why oh why do you close at 3pm   For veggie options  I prefer the breakfast tacos over the ones in the  vegetarian  category.  But on weekdays after 11  breakfast tacos cease to exist.  In the vegetarian section  my favorites are the Heather and Space Cowboy.  Space Cowboy is the veggie version of one of their more famous tacos.  Papadulce sounds better than it is  in my opinion.  The Jess Special and El Popeye are my go to s on the breakfast menu.  You can t really go wrong.  They make their own salsas.  Pay attention to the spice level if you re spice intolerant--they don t lie   People try to compare Tacodeli to Austin s other famous taco joints  but I don t think the comparison can be made.  It s too different.  But here  you do come out possibly feeling like you made a healthier decision... maybe.
Tacodeli,500,A large factor in moving into my current apartment is that it s next door to tacodeli.  The food is amazing.  The staff is fantastic.  I love it so much and spend so much money there  that Tacodeli is it s own line item on my budget.  I ve only had two mishaps there.  Once  I called in an order and they didn t get started on it until i was there to pick it up.  They were astoundingly busy that day  and the manager apologized sincerely and profusely.  They also gave me coupons for free tacos during my next visit.  The other was that they accidentally left one taco out of my order.  I got the same great service when they made it right.  These are only two incidents out of probably about 100 visits and they bent over backwards to make sure I returned.    Pro Tip   call in your order then pick it up.  They get suuuuper busy because of how awesome they are
Eldorado Cafe,1,While staying in the area a friend told us to try this place for great Tex-Mex food and he was right   As first I was worried when I walked in and didn t see anyone that  looked  Mexican  all white people up front   but their food was on-point   From their various salsas to the selection of interesting  brunch breakfast items on their menu to the execution  it was all spot-on and tasted great   Service was excellent as well   We sat at the bar and the young lady who helped us  she had multiple piercings and tats and was skinny  was awesome   Very knowledgeable about the menu and friendly    Highly recommend stopping in here for an excellent Mexican breakfast 
Eldorado Cafe,2,exactly what i expect from a tex mex restaurant in austin. great service  unique vibes  fresh ingredients  tons of unique salsas and menu options with some vegan options as well. food was full of flavor and the staff was amazing. my daughter started crying and we were able to change our order togo AND they comped the margaritas we were unable to finish. truly wonderful experience and will be back next time we re in austin.  deducte done star because they didn t have fajitas  a texmex staple  but they enchilada offerings make up for it.
Eldorado Cafe,3,Eldorado Cafe is currently  10 on my list of one hundred and forty taco locations.  AustinTacoMojo.com  Though they weren t always ranked as high on my list. For my first two visits  I was their during the availability of their lunch menu but breakfast is where they truly shine.  Their Too Hot To Tot  Crispy Tater Tots  Black Beans  Queso  Jack Cheese  Avocado Slices  Housemade Pickled Jalapenos  and Green Onions  and Big Papas  Papas Rellena  Mushrooms  Fried Egg  amp  Jack Cheese  are both pretty great but the Migas Taco is what brought their ranking up to  10. One of their secrets is that they include queso on their Migas Taco so  how could you go wrong   Their Salsa X  medium hot  is not to be missed   The owner  Chef Joel Fried gathered experience by working alongside Mexican line cooks at over 30 restaurants including in the early days at Tacodeli. So  he knows what he s doing. He will often come visit the table to check in with guests to ensure the highest of customer satisfaction. The service here is exceptional. The waitstaff is attentive  friendly  and accommodating.
Eldorado Cafe,4,Place was super busy on a Saturday night. You can make a reservation so def do that. The food was really good  Service was spot on too  The employees have good attitudes and great customer service. The margaritas looked so good but I didn t get one this time.
Eldorado Cafe,5,As good as any Mexican food you re gonna get  The mole was outstanding. My son had a burrito and absolutely loved it. My wife had a veggie plate and said it was delicious. We ll be back again  and again.
Eldorado Cafe,6,Much overdue review for ElDorado. I really love this cute  low key spot. It reminds me of old Austin  not sure if I should say that or not  but it s the truth. Amazing service every time we ve visited. I even used them in May for pick up catering for my father s birthday. As a beef enchilada connoisseur  he was delighted and thoroughly enjoyed his birthday lunch and the sides  rice  black beans and grilled veggies . 2 weeks ago I visited with my bestie-- She loved her chicken tostadas and Paloma. I tried a new dish for me  the burrito. This was some of the most flavorful carnitas I ve tasted in a while. So. Good. The mango margaritas were equally enjoyable. See y all soon ElDorado 
Eldorado Cafe,7,Food  5 5 El Dorado is such a hidden gem that serves up the best Tex-Mex in Austin. Although it is slightly more expensive compared to other Austin Tex-Mex staples  El Dorado follows up with better food to scale. The El Dorado burrito  Supa Queso  and Chicken enchiladas were stellar. CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK   Service  5 5 WOW  just WOW  The staff here is so friendly and welcoming. Even when having to wait for a table  the hostess directed us to the bar to order margaritas. One of the managers continued to check in on us while we waited for a table with a huge smile on his face as he welcomed other guests. Other restaurants need to take note because El Dorado staff is TOP TIER   Environment  5 5 El Dorado is very clean and fits the Tex-Mex vibe that others aspire to replicate. The location is tucked away in a strip mall  but don t let that fool you 
Eldorado Cafe,8,Excellent food. Can t believe I waited for an hour and 20 mins  but worth it. Wish they would expand to a larger location or further north.
Eldorado Cafe,9,Updating because we still love this place  and even more so. It s my husband s go-to for his birthday and promotions. I ordered the Las Cruces Banado burrito plate and it was  chef s kiss . Officially a new favorite for both of us   Amazing even as take-out.
Eldorado Cafe,10,Our favorite neighborhood restaurant  Food  service  margaritas  ambiance...all top notch and worth the wait. I almost don t want them to get too much more popular -- they re just THAT good 
Eldorado Cafe,11,Really great Mexican food in town   I was in town with a friend and grabbed dinner here on a Wednesday night. They were able to seat us quickly and very courteous. The staff was personable and upbeat which made for a fun experience.  The food - so yummy  I got tacos and my friend got the burrito. Large portions and very tasty. We also got margaritas which were out of this world   Highly suggest a visit here 
Eldorado Cafe,12,My former boss raved about this place for a long a   time  and finally he took me there for lunch and I fell in love with this gem hidden inside this strip center.   They offer several salsa options and my personal favorite that I recommend to everyone is their salsa x. It has a unique Smokey flavor and reminds me of my moms chutney  so perhaps I m biased but everyone s loved it. Definitely has a good kick without it being overwhelming.  Their crispy beef tacos are the best in town.   Their cabo salad with the sherry vinaigrette is satisfying and has a good flavor  amp  texture balance.   The thunder Rosa taco is SPICY. That pepper is no joke so I recommend just taking it out if you can t handle spice.   I ve ordered catering from here and was impressed how all the food was packaged and the quality of it.   My only cons are the enchiladas suiza is well made but personally it was a bit too tangy for my taste and the balance wasn t there and the margs could be stronger but that s it.  Highly highly recommend if you re in the area and  supportlocal
Eldorado Cafe,13,Ordered the chilaquiles rojas and it was SO good  Definitely would come back again and order it again   Also ordered two of the breakfast tacos. They were also good  but comparing it to the chilaquiles  it just didn t compare.   Their house made salsas are also on point  Definitely order some of them as they have a great variety.   The staff was extremely friendly  quick  and very helpful  Would definitely recommend checking this place out and will definitely go back again and again.
Eldorado Cafe,14,This may be my absolute fave Mexican spot in all of Austin. Tucked away in a strip center off Anderson Mill  this colorful spot offers fast  friendly service and the food is always fresh and prepared perfectly. On a recent visit we tried the enormous burrito and the carnitas with the freshest  hot  tortillas. The Carnitas Cubanos were savory and had a satisfying crispness to them. Paired with a generous side salad and black beans  it was a large enough portion for two. The salsa packs a punch and is tangy  spicy and savory. If Taco Deli Dona sauce and Roja sauce had a love child  this would be it. Apparently the owner once worked at TD  which is why their masked potatoes are similar but BETTER. The entrees come with several choices for side dishes and the menu is varied. This is always on the map for me when I m north of the river.
Eldorado Cafe,15,Literally the BEST service I ve had here in Austin.   Joel  who is the owner  was so accommodating and he even gave me suggestions for other restaurants to try in town   Their Supa Chalupa was absolutely one of the best tacos I ve had hands down 
Eldorado Cafe,16,I struggled to like my meal here. As a lifelong Tex-Mex fan I wanted to. I found it from a great review in an Austin Best Of list. A lot of people clearly love it. I have the X salsa  the guacamole  and the standard enchiladas with chicken  rice and beans. Best was the guacamole  but even that was a bit creamy for my taste. The thin and light texture chips had some kind of dusting of seasoning  which is an immediate negative for me. The salsa made them worse and I immediately knew I was in trouble. Wrong choice of salsa  average guacamole  chips I wouldn t eat over a salad. And the enchiladas looked great but were a mashed up and uninspired taste. I just couldn t pick out the flavors. Seemed more new style than old  and I m clearly an old style pardner.
Eldorado Cafe,17,Recently came here for the first time and I am now a regular. I was looking for a Mexican style breakfast place exactly like this and my expectations were matched and even exceeded. The Chilaquiles  Freddie s Plate  and the potato croquettes were all amazing. I also tried a watermelon Fresca which was so fresh and delicious. I also love that they have so many salsa options for you to choose from rather than just one house salsa. I am fan for life 
Eldorado Cafe,18,Oh how happy I am that your doors are open again for dining in.  While to-go carried me through my enchilada cravings  it s just never as good as getting those piping hot plates of yum placed in front of me amidst the buzz of people and chatter.   Never had a bad experience here   Service  drinks  food have been on point. It s a unique menu and I m grateful for it. In a city with Tex-Mex galore  the lean towards interior Mexican is worth its weight in mole.   The Sandinista is innocent looking but beware merriment will ensue   .  Even without a reso  get your name added to the walk in list  order a libation  go outside and enjoy some convo with the locals.
Eldorado Cafe,19,I found this little gem to be a very charming family friendly restaurant with great service and excellent food. Everyone was friendly and helpful and everything we ordered was delicious. They also have a bevy of salsa choices  of which the smoky creamy medium and the scorpion are both delicious. Will be trying the avocado salsa next time. Onto my favorites   THE SUPA QUESO. I mean yes it s hard to mess up cheese  but seriously I could not stop myself from eating it. Note to self  combining beans and guacamole with queso is the way to go.  THE SUPA CHUPA. Oh man  I ate this thing in about 30 seconds  granted I was racing my toddler before she started throwing a tantrum but still. The carnitas were perfectly crispy without being dried out and whatever the smoky sauce is paired perfectly with the meat.  Overall  a very enjoyable dinner. We will definitely be back  PS I love the dog tables.
Eldorado Cafe,20,Eldorado Caf  came through for me on their website s description of itself as Mexican inspired comfort food.  Founders Joe and Joanna Fried with their chefs Esme Tejeda and Rene and engaging wait staff delivered one of the most memorable culinary experiences in a very unassuming shopping center on Anderson Lane.  Worth the one hour trip to dine inside this restaurant with an eclectic  funky  interior d cor and  life is back to normal  vibe.     Eldorado Caf  provides their creative culinary brilliance with dine-in  curb-side  or catering options spanning a spectrum from Pequenos  appetizers   stews  distinctive enchiladas  tacos  burritos  salads and bowls for both carnivores and vegans. Open for breakfast  lunch  and dinner  be sure to book a reservation.    While executing to perfection on classic Mexican options  Eldorado Caf  is anything but classic with its inclusion of cross ethnic inspired ingredients  spices  and meats  and mushrooms   including ancho  roasted green chiles  Cuban Mojo  Chimichurri   and my personal favorite  a delectable Mole that reminded me of Fonda San Miguel back in the 2000 s.   I will not be referring to this establishment as a Mexican restaurant and those reviewers looking for the large oval piping hot plate of melted cheddar cheese over greasy enchiladas and refried beans  should go elsewhere.   Let s get started.  Firstly  the wait staff including my waitress and every hard-working employee providing services  thank you line cooks   hats off  for a terrific customer oriented delivery.  Second  while I m not a cocktail reviewer  their  creative  cocktails were a bonus and not an expectation  allowing the infusion of what they refer to as twists including watermelon  highly recommended   and scorpio  very hot  to top shelf tequilas Margaritas.  Starters included the Eldorado Salsa Sampler  a selection of amazingly prepared salsas from mild  avocado  to the El Scorpio  did I mention very hot  diablo    the Honolulu Pork Mini Tacos  essentially carnitas on soft yellow tortillas with a unique pineapple Jicama slaw  w  pickled onions   and the Eldorado Queso  a creamy white queso studded with dark green peppers.  With the freshest homemade chips  all above are highly recommended.  For mid-plates  I had the Thunder Rosa Taco on flour which you cannot go wrong with seasoned bacon  sirloin  chiles  and onions and the popular Guaco Taco  essentially a huge guacamole  refried black beans  and fresh pico  without the overly added red onions  on a surprisingly thin crispy hard shell.  Nirvana struck when the Mole Enchiladas arrived  which in my opinion deserves a special name such as Immortal or Heavenly Enchiladas.  I understand not everyone likes Moles  but with the laborious cooking process  and when done correctly  the sauce is nothing less than a silky  rich  chocolate  savory sauce that will leave you speechless.  With enough mole to blend with the studded rice and refried black beans  w  some awesome crumbled white cheese - cotjita    I cleaned this plate. Highly recommend.   One request  a Seafood or shrimp Enchilada please  Del Mar.    Thank you employees and owners for this dining experience. I ll be back to try the other 95  of the menu. Thanks for adding to the Austin culinary community.
Eldorado Cafe,21,I love their chicken Vera Cruz. It s both creamy and tangy without being heavy. Eldorado  locally owned  is such an asset to our neighborhood. Wonderful selection of what I d call  slightly healthier  Mexican food  without losing the essence of the original dishes. Their salsas are a must. They re not complimentary  but they are a good value for the quality and experience. They must use top-notch ingredients in all their dishes. I ve never ordered anything I wasn t impressed with 
Eldorado Cafe,22,Eldorado is a hidden gem. Flavors are multi dimensional and the salsa is better than anything at Taco Deli. Check out the papas rellenas  basically fried goat cheese balls with dipping salsa.   Pro tip - order their breakfast tacos online... they re cheap and the best ones in town.
Eldorado Cafe,23,BEST BREAKFAST IN AUSTIN   I ll love someone to message me and let me try and find a better spot. I can t believe I just now stumbled upon this gem. I was tempted not to leave a review because I m selfish and want it to myself lol.   Service         Amazing  I spoke to managers and staff and everyone was freindly and prompt  Kara at the bar is bomb  She can make a mean Michelada.  Drinks     Kara put a little extra spicy twist on my Michelada.  They have their own blend of mix here and it is unique as ever and oh so amazing.   Food      I had the Machacado plate. It s freaking to die for   Best Machacado I ve ever eaten and I m a way Texas Mexico Texan. Seriously I wouldn t change a thing.   Come try this place I guarantee you won t be disappointed in the food unless your taste buds are broken.   I ve heard they have a crazy crowd on weekends so make reservations   
Eldorado Cafe,24,Consistently very good food  excellent  service and well organized.  Always a contender for my lunch business when in North Austin.  If I didn t live so far away  it would be on my dinner radar as well
Eldorado Cafe,25,Was looking for a good Mexican restaurant and this one is conveniently located right next to mopac  I had their Joel s happy plate which was a good mix of enchiladas and sides  I love that they put a fried egg on top. Something else I thought was neat is that they let you choose what kind of salsa you get served as a complementary starter. No gate keeping those who can t handle their spice here. I brought some Mexican friends and they loved their tortilla soups even if it isn t the typical way it is served. The service was quick and kind  I could see them delivering take out to the cars outside the whole time so clearly they are popular. The interior dining room isn t too large and so sometimes it s necessary to have to wait for a table but it is well worth it.
Eldorado Cafe,26,Amazing food  Catered our daughters birthday with them and all of our guests loved it 
Eldorado Cafe,27,Absolutely fantastic in every sense  The food is so good. We didn t have a single mediocre thing. Chips are fresh  salsas are different and unique  and the plates are a great size. A  all day
Eldorado Cafe,28,The food was way better than expected. I am usually hesitant on tex-mex but I was quite surprised. The medium-salsa they provided was so flavorful and addicting. The rice was flavorless  though. Only reason I give four stars instead of five is because the mole sauce was insanely sweet for me. I love mole and this was a bit too sweet. I still ended up finishing my plate because it grew on me. The margarita and Paloma was up to standard without anything being too much or too little. I ll definitely return.
Eldorado Cafe,29,I m not sure I get it. Sure  El Dorado has decent Mexican food. So does about 75  of the Tex mex joints in this city. Why are people so obsessed with this spot. I mean forget eating here without a reservation- even for lunch. Again  this place is good. Tacos are solid  etc. but it is not anywhere near the hype.
Eldorado Cafe,30,Very much enjoyed the chef owner s interpretation of Tex-Mex Mexican food.  The Joel s Happy Plate was full of flavor  the corn tortillas used were excellent and the jicama slaw was a nice touch that makes the meal feel more healthy and well-rounded.
Eldorado Cafe,31,Absolutely worth the wait. All of the food at Eldorado is fresh  tasty  and the service is amazing. It is slightly expensive  but I ve never left spending that amount of money and feeling like I didn t get what I paid for. I ve had a lot of the menu and everything from the salsas to the salads to the tacos to the enchiladas are amazing. I think the only thing that isn t my favorite is their guacamole is pretty salty -- so it s great on food but not so great alone. I think my server who I ve had the most is Jen  They are top notch and honestly all the service I ve had is great. Get a reservation and you get to skip the ALWAYS long line. It s worth any wait though.
Eldorado Cafe,32,In short   Service  4stars Quality  amp  taste 3.5 stars Quantity for the price  2stars  you have to stuff yourself with some chips or appetizer before entrees  to fill your tummy  as there entrees portions are more like tapas small plate portions.  We had made a reservations  so got seated as soon we walked in  ordered Enchiladas suizas  shaunna wanna taco salad  kids cheese enchiladas.  Chips and salsa  chips were warm  salsa was good  the orange one  light green is there spicy one  other than spicy ness it doesn t have any other flavors. I personally don t eat much chips  it s none to very less  and wait for the main dish  but here is a tip  in eldorarado  I d suggest eat the chips  as there entrees don t fill your tummy    Enchilada suizas  sauce has a very sharp sourness and it s overwhelming and you don t taste anything else other than sour taste  it s 2 or 3 tiny enchiladas  rice and beans that came with it was good.  Shaunna wanna taco salad  in description it says so much  but all we got was very little lettuce mix with sour cream  avocados and chicken  not even some black beans in it  but the grilled chicken was very good  but way too skimpy for the price  taco shell was good too  light and crisp.  Kids cheese enchiladas  my kid asked if he can get a chicken enchiladas and our server said yes but dint mention the  2 up charge and we don t mind paying  but it s a single  literally finger sized   length wise  2 fingers width wise  enchiladas filled with cheese and chicken  I don t think they had used even a single nugget sized chicken in it  and it was drenched with too much cheese  my kid who like cheese  couldn t eat that much    Overall  personally I always prefer quality over quantity  but at the same time  there entrees whatever we ordered were  14   tips and taxes  for that price I expect I should feel full  not stuffed nor leftovers to take home  just full.
Eldorado Cafe,33,Place is cute inside   but as for the food it was overpriced  flavorless and small portions.  Moreover   our server had a very snarky attitude which I did not care for in the slightest.  I ve had their food catered several times and it was excellent and good portions for a group of 10.  This experience dining in was not in any way enjoyable.
Eldorado Cafe,34,Eldorado Cafe has quickly become my favorite restaurants in Austin. I think they have some of the best enchiladas and margaritas I have ever had. While it may not be  traditional  Mexican  and items like fajitas are not on the menu  I still consider it one of the best causal Mexican restaurants in Austin. If you haven t been before  I recommend tying the salsa sampler to get the lay of the land ... they have a ton of options. My favorite enchiladas are the Enchiladas Suizas  and the house margarita is fantastic. I ve recommended this place to numerous people  and all have come back with positive reviews. I always try and make a reservation on Resy  especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Check it out  you won t be disappointed 
Eldorado Cafe,35,This place really checked off all of the boxes of delicious tasting food  The salsa sampler  least spicy on the left to most spicy on the right   I highly recommend. Our favorite was the left three  in picture . We ordered the Enchiladas Suizas  chicken with fried egg  beef .
Eldorado Cafe,36,This place was so good.  I was in town for an evening and needed some Mexican food  I hit the jackpot  I got the Chile con carne enchiladas  they were amazing   The salsa collection was amazing. The owner was so very kind. He checked on our table and we chatted a little bit. He was very kind. Stop in this place. You will be so glad you did   
Eldorado Cafe,37,We just had the most amazing meal and margs at Eldorado Cafe   The chips were fresh  the five salsa options were flavorful and layered  and our meal was outstanding  Our margs were made fresh and tasted delicious  Hope to be back in the near future and would recommend to all of our friends  Thanks Eldorado Cafe 
Eldorado Cafe,38,Great service and out of sight Tex mex cuisine. I had enchiladas suiza and my son had a queso burrito. Also had a cocktail. As out of towners half hour wait was nothing were we are from especially without a reservation. Food was really good and well priced.
Eldorado Cafe,39,The food and drinks are very tasty. There is often a long wait. Quality of service has varied significantly across multiple visits  but that might be more about the Great Resignation Realization than about this operation in particular. Shout out to the short rib salpicon  all the enchiladas  margaritas  and the peach bourbon smash.
Eldorado Cafe,40,This place was amazing. From the food  the service  and the ambiance nothing short of great   The manager even went around and asked everyone how they were liking their visit. Very nice 
Eldorado Cafe,41,Veggie Burrito Supreme   as a bowl. Tasted great  loved the chips and salsa as well. Service was great all the employees were friendly 
Eldorado Cafe,42,Low-key funky Austin with some of the best Mexican food you can find. Unassuming little dive shopping center. Get there early for the best Migas I ve ever had.  SWOON 
Eldorado Cafe,43,El Dorado Cafe is a definite favorite  Best friendliest service. Amazing innovative and fresh food that I think of as Aus-Mex. IMHO they have the best house margaritas in town. Reasonable prices  giant portions and careful preparation  add in the friendly crew and good vibe  I d come here every week if I could 
Eldorado Cafe,44,The food is great  served by cool people. I ve been numerous times  at breakfast  lunch  and supper. Last Wednesday I had a Taco Bowl with carne guisada and squash on the side  yum yum yum  Love this place 
Eldorado Cafe,45,I ve heard from many people this place is great. I ve only tried it through delivery but man  was it delicious  Huevos Rancheros is one of my favorite dishes anywhere and this dish did not disappoint at Eldorado. I would love to actually go to the location and check out the food fresh out of the kitchen as it was a little cold with delivery  which happens with a lot of deliveries . Thanks Eldorado and see you at your restaurant.
Eldorado Cafe,46,I went to lunch here with one of my friends from college. The margaritas were pretty good  but not exceptional.  The chips and salsa were very good  I liked that their hot salsa was actually spicy  They had a lot of nice options for vegetarians  so that was much appreciated I had the cheese enchiladas with mole. The food was good  but I ve had better mole. I will return  but I ll try a different dish next time. No complaints about the service. They weren t exceptionally friendly  but they did their job and provided good service. The restaurant was very clean.
Eldorado Cafe,47,Visiting friends in Austin and had a chance to eat at El Dorado. Unbelievable food. The carnitas Cubano is sooo good and the salsa sampler is a treat  Just great service and delicious food. Stop by if you are passing though.
Eldorado Cafe,48,This is the best food that I ve ever put in my face.  Not totally true  I ve spent time in France and well cheese.  I get the same thing  carnitas  and it s heavenly. My only complaint is that I wish they had a bigger space to reduce the wait. But it s worth the wait regardless. The margaritas help to pass the time. And the staff is so nice. I love this place. Don t go here. I
Eldorado Cafe,49,I m not a big fan of Tex Mex  but if it s something you crave  you should definitely give it a try  The queso and chips are pretty darn good  Enchilada are cheesy and veggies are crisp  They have have a great drink menu and the staff is always great  Lines can be long so come prepared.
Eldorado Cafe,50,Fantastic neighborhood Tex-Mex  friendly and wonderful staff.  Sometimes have to wait  but it s fun talking with other patrons. Highly recommend.
Eldorado Cafe,51,I love this place the food here is so unique and flavorful . Seriously I ve been taking all my friends here for brunch and everyone love it here . I love the colorful decor   the waitstaff are all so kind and nice . I will be coming back soon   I would of taking pictures but I devour everything soo fast . Another reason to come back .  I love the Joel s enchiladas plate and the tio white potatoes and the nomad plate   
Eldorado Cafe,52,What a lovely place with great food and great service. The owner himself was making rounds and stopped to meet us  which was incredibly kind. Our two waitresses were enthusiastic and rolled with the punches as our group had 5 kids who were all over the place   Moving to the food  we are vegetarian and they had soo many options  The food was all fresh and tasty  and they had a good variety of sauces as well   Thanks for the awesome experience and wish you lots of success 
Eldorado Cafe,53,Favorite Mexican restaurant.  Very consistency good food.  The owner always stops by to say hello.  The margaritas are nice. The crispy tacos are the best. I wish I could give them 5 stars. The wait staff and bartenders are always attentive.
Eldorado Cafe,54,Wow- I can t say enough.   I wanted to try this place a while back because I had heard good things  but I went on  a day when they are closed.  My husband and I stopped in today.   He mostly wanted to sit at the bar- which is closed due to Covid and we almost left.  I said- no way   we are here  I ve been wanting to try this place.  We were not starved but I wanted to at least try their salsa .  We had the medium red salsa and also the Green verde avocado - both were so good with warm authentic chips.   Very fresh.  The menu looked so good  we both felt like we needed to order something else.   We landed on a taco   la carte but both of us decided to order the same one- the Thunder Rosa taco.  All I can say is OMG-   I m a hard critic- and this is so well done.    I can t wait to go back 
Eldorado Cafe,55,This place is amazing  I love their dishes  Although I haven t had much Tex-Mex foods before  but the enchilada verde and the carne guisada are really tasty  I ordered the tomato pinto bean  sorry I can t remember its proper name  and roasted veggies as sides  and I really love the veggies in the meals. Also pls do order the chips and salsa X  I m not a fan for chips and salsa  but their salsa X is too tasty to miss it.   Also the curbside pickup is pretty safe  you wait in the car and they would put the food on the chair in front of your car and leave  and you can take your order then.
Eldorado Cafe,56,Favorite Austin restaurant. I have never had anything which wasn t amazing.  Margaritas are second to none.  Avocado salsa is the best.  Mojo pollo   Staff is always helpful and on-top of everything.
Eldorado Cafe,57,WOW... Extremely happy with this place. New to texas and have been searching for good mexican food.. HMMMmmmm.. Staff is great  the owner leads by example and.. the FOOD is GREAT    Id recommend to EVERYONE..
Eldorado Cafe,58,In short  the food was great and they have a great system for takeout during covid   We placed an order online  pulled up to the carryout parking spot  texted them  and within a minute they brought out our food   As for the food  the two entrees  sirloin tampique o and enchiladas verdes were good and flavorful. Though I still feel like I m searching austin for my favorite enchiladas. Each was just enough for one person  no leftovers .  The crispy tacos were a good snack to add on to the meal. My favorite dish was actually the papas rellenas  which were fried perfectly and just melt in your mouth  I highly recommend these.  I ll be back to try some other dishes in the future for sure.
Eldorado Cafe,59,Joel and his team have something pretty amazing. The service is top notch  the food is all amazing and the drinks... Casa Amigos on the tequilita menu. If you know  you know. It s all great. If you are in north central and northwest Austin and you have not been  RUN    Of there is a wait  get on the list and order a margarita  it s more than worth whatever the wait is. Hats off to El Dorado Cafe   Get the Salsa X 
Eldorado Cafe,60,I am a teacher so breakfast out is a rare treat that I like to indulge in the summer. I d planned to check out several places  one a week or so  but after stopping back at Eldorado Cafe the first week  I have been here every Wednesday so far. Everything is fresh and delicious from the migas plate  to tacos to chilaquiles to build-your-own-bowl to agua fresca  lemonade  yum . I m trying to think of something different for tomorrow  but I am dying to try the biscuits...
Eldorado Cafe,61,Oh that potato bean taco is something  And their salsa sauces are the best  Outside tables allow for safer dining options. Pleasant staff interactions too.
Eldorado Cafe,62,Very delicious   I might be basic but the cheese enchiladas hit the spot. Also really good chips and salsa.
Eldorado Cafe,63,We love coming here  The chips and salsa are yummy and their carnitas cubanos is to die for. It s almost  20  but comes with two sides. I order it with their no hater tater  cheesy mashed potatoes  and las calabasas  a variety of roasted squash . Highly recommend that combo  I would absolutely recommend making a reservation. Even with a reservation you ll still likely need to wait. Space is definitely tight. I would call this a  kid friendly  place but you can definitely bring the whole fam and be fine. Gets a little loud and doesn t have much space to wait for a table inside. Overall  definitely go  and definitely make a reservation.
Eldorado Cafe,64,Huge fans  This was our first time here  I know  where have we been    and we loved it  First off  our server Dez  was the sweetest person ever. She and everyone on staff were incredibly helpful and attentive. The food was some of the best Mexican food we ve had in Austin - and the ambiance was super laid back and just overall lovely. Prices were reasonable too  Just a perfect spot all around 
Eldorado Cafe,65,My favorite restaurant in Austin  hands down  The food is fantastic  and Joel  Eric  and the staff always make me feel welcome. It s one of my favorite places to take out-of-town guests  and they re never disappointed. Do yourself a favor and check out Eldorado  but you better make a reservation...the food and service are so stellar there s often a wait.
Eldorado Cafe,66,This is one of the best Mexican food places in the entire city of Austin and man that is one bold statement to make.  El Dorado has existed in north Austin for the past 4 years off the intersection of W Anderson ln   Shoal Creek  right off the mopac exit .  This place gets so busy it is online reservations except for the few walkups accepted  so be advised.    Consider Eldorado a upscale fusion style Mexican food place.  They have typical items such as enchiladas  different tacos  quesadillas and tostadas.  This place excels in their specialty dishes.  The Carnitas Cubanos is my favorite  also the shiny ribs  papas rellenos and many others.  You are going to sit looking at the menu a solid 5min before you are able to come with a decision.  They have a variety of 5 different salsa you can order along with queso or guacamole.  They even serve flan or mini donuts for dessert if you are still hungry.  Margaritas are strong and they have a very cool bar drink menu.  They also have an awesome weekend brunch menu.    The service is very friendly and on top of everything.  The restaurant only has roughly 15 tables  but does well with the space provided.  You will likely see Joel walking around who pretty much runs the place  such a friendly person to meet with.  This place is always packed because it is so good  so like I said  make a reservation.  If you want unique tasting Mexican food to try out  then this place is your winner.
Eldorado Cafe,67,I go to the Eldorado Cafe literally every Friday. It is amazing. I can t tell you how many Eldorado stickers I ve stuck onto all all of my belongings. I normally get the cheese enchiladas with beef and a side of rice. The nachos and quesadillas are really good too. They have great service and deliver your food really fast. If you live in Austin or you re visiting  I d definitely consider stopping by Eldorado.
Eldorado Cafe,68,Pro  Found this location on Happy Cow.  Food is good here. Pretty busy in-dining room on the Friday I went. Very limited choices on menu for vegan but the veganchilada was great.   Con  Not allowed to sit outside and use the  tables chairs to eat my to-go order as I had walked there. I was taking Covid precautions. I saw no staff or customers in restaurant doing so.
Eldorado Cafe,69,I love this place. The curly haired guy at the front desk needs to get off his phone and actually remember to be polite to people. Rolling your eyes is a visible action.
Eldorado Cafe,70,Absolutely delicious breakfast tacos  I gobbled up the Big Papa  crispy yet creamy papa rellena...like a potato croquette  two big slices of bacon  gooey egg  cheese  and the Matt s Everything taco  go look at the description in the menus  there s too many things to list .   Every component is of very high quality  well seasoned and cooked well. The quality of the bacon especially stood out -- decently thick without being chewy  crisp  not stringy fat  and great smoky flavor that comes through. Not greasy either.   Love the 3 potato hash they have in the tacos too -- I wouldn t have thought that sweet potato was something I would care for but it worked as part of everything else  a little sweetness to balance the salt .  Then after I finished my tacos  I went straight back into buy an 8oz container of Salsa X  cos it s so good I need it in my fridge.   Can t wait to come back and try their breakfast plates and the lunch dinner options
Eldorado Cafe,71,Oh my stars  how have I been in Austin all this time and just now dining at Eldorado Cafe    Well  for one...it s somewhat hidden  so thanks yelp for bringing it to my attention     I popped on their website and it encouraged me to make a reservation  glad I did   They were quite busy on a random Wednesday night   They have the tables nice and spread out...don t know if that s all the time or just because of COVID  whatever  it was nice.  We were greeted by several hosts that were all lovely.  Taken to our seat and out came the most informed  lovely  friendly wait person I ve ever had the pleasure of visiting with.  They talked to us about their favorites from drinks to apps  entrees to desserts   All three of us had EXCELLENT drinks.  They didn t have the exact drink a friend wanted...server said  how about you try this....  And my friend LOVED it     Onto our food...they have BOMB queso  so happy we tried that as well.  I ordered just two crispy tacos  I know I m boring  but I know what I like and they were excellent     Believe it or not  more people can screw up something so simple    My husband had some enchiladas.  I fail at remembering the type  but I m thinking it was something with a cream sauce.  I took one bite and while he LOVED them  I will say  if you have a sensitive stomach  they re rich LOL...look out. Our friend had the tater tot bowl and our server advised to put mushrooms in it.  She said it was absolutely amazing.  We were going to go without dessert  but my husband spotted these cinnamon donuts on the menu...holy heavenly bliss.  It came with four small donuts in the order and they were warm on top of that.....ahhhhhhh  the angels sang from above with each bite.  Ten outta ten Eldorado   Y all are rockstars and totally deserve the cult level following you have.  Where do I sign up to become a member of this fan club   We WILL be back 
Eldorado Cafe,72,Yum   Enchiladas are so good I keep ordering them instead of branching out haha. Food and drinks are consistently good  even when ordering to go   Also love their mashed potatoes and mojo veggies on the side - so delicious and a nice change from standard rice and beans.  They also have a variety of salsas  which is nice if your family has different spice or flavor preferences  and they re good as well 
Eldorado Cafe,73,This review is long overdue. Been coming here for 3 years now and absolutely love everything about it. From their food and drinks to their staff  it s always a great experience. Their meats  especially their carnitas  are quality and they have the best breakfast taco in Texas. The BIG Papas is unreal   My wife and I have probably had 100 by now between the both of us. My last visit I asked to turn their tater tot bowl into a burrito and added my own modifications. Our server was all about it and after I got it  almost every server came to our table to check it out. Possibly a new menu item Joel  
Eldorado Cafe,74,I was in at least 7 months before we finally tried and my god I don t know what we were waiting for   I think I was there 4 times in the first couple weeks after my first visit.  The team there is amazing - everyone is on it - my servers are always awesome. The food is fantastic.  The enchilada suizas were my fav - so good - perfect green sauce flavor and melty yummy cheese. Was so surprised how good the veggies sides were too - the squash with pepitas I think it was so flavorful and tasting once I had it sort of mushy the other a little hard  veggie bites  and I liked both.   The hot green salsa is excellent and I don t know what they put in their rice and beans to make them so damn flavorful - gold maybe  My gosh they are so simple and so good.  Their queso is a thin runny queso that I spilled on the table and myself  thin isn t really my fav style queso but it has good flavor .  We had short ribs and mashed potatoes first trip too - unreal    I was all about those suizas until I went for the la cruces banado on night - my god the pork and pepper and onions with the green Chile sauce  It was so gd delicious    Haven t been for breakfast yet which I know is a mistake will do that next. Go see them  If you can t get a resy table go and get in the list for a table they are fast and it s worth the wait.
Eldorado Cafe,75,amazing service  aggressively mediocre food. not a single drop of seasoning  not sure the cook knows where the salt resides. the vibe of the restaurant is quite nice  highly recommend the goat cheese dip but that is IT.
Eldorado Cafe,76,We had a reservation and went to dine-in on Sunday as a late Mother s Day dinner for myself  my kids  and my mom. Y ALL  I was blown away. Your location is easy to find. You folks are friendly. The interior is beautiful and I love the artwork. Jennifer K rocked our socks as our server. The best part was the darn food  It was delivered promptly  hot  and it was delicious. We were so happy with the whole meal. We even got some things to go. The house margaritas were bomb.  I had the enchiladas verdes with chicken and added a fried egg. Mom had the same minus the egg. Yum  My son had the Joel s plate and he loved it. My daughter had the kid s chicken breast and enjoyed it. They have Maine Root sodas  our favorite.   I hope everyone checks this place out. Everything about the visit just felt right.
Eldorado Cafe,77,We went for lunch and the food was AMAZING  My husband had the Dart Bowl enchiladas and I had the suiza enchiladas. All of the ingredients are fresh and the flavor was wonderful. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable. We met the owner who genuinely makes you feel special. I will definitely be back and will tell all of my friends and family about this hidden gem. Ona side note  I have celiac disease and am a vegetarian- they  have many GF and Veg options.
Eldorado Cafe,78,A staple to visit every time I m in Austin. One of my favorite restaurants ever. I have celiac disease and it s great to know what dishes I can safely eat  they even have cross contamination labeled on the menu . Knowledgeable employees and delicious food. I would 10 10 recommend the supa chalupa  
Eldorado Cafe,79,I live In chicago now  but each time I go home  this is an absolute for me. The salsas.....the drinks.....the staff. All amazing 
Eldorado Cafe,80,Came in on Saturday evening. Unable to sit at bar. Table was ready in under 10 min. Get the joes happy plate sooo yummy 
Eldorado Cafe,81,Breaks my heart to come in here and throw down a five star review  because I don t want more people to keep coming here and making it even busier than it already is. But here we are     This is a fantastic establishment. Service is always great. The food is always fresh  perfectly seasoned  perfectly cooked. They get a crispy  tasty browning  that s  maillard  to you foodies  on their chicken that I haven t seen in any other restaurant  and I wish I knew how they did it. Their menu options are excellent... go ahead - look at the menu. Look at the food photos here on Yelp. This review practically writes itself.  They do curbside and the food is great as takeout  in case you were wondering.
Eldorado Cafe,82,Eldorado Cafe offers a unique eating experience. There flavors stand alone amongst other place we have visited. Service is outstanding  along with the food. This was the first time for lunch and it didn t disappoint at all. The Salsa sampler is a must in our book. There is something for everyone. Along with some queso  it was off to a good start.... Wife went with Beef Enchiladas  double rice. Sauce was rich in flavor  rice was light and fluffy. I went the route of the Enchiladas Verde with Chicken. The sauce is just amazing. Tender Chicken  Killer Black Beans and do yourself a favor and take a look at the other side dishes they offer...I went the Las Calabasas...One of the best side dishes I have ever had...Finally something different  I will say that Eldorado is on the higher side    ....But  you absolutely get what you pay for. I wouldnt hesitate to go back again...and we will for sure....It would be hard to pick between the breakfast or the Lunch menu....Both are Great  
Eldorado Cafe,83,Perfect spot for lunch  Service is always quick and super friendly. The food and house margaritas never disappoint. Taj n on the rim for house margaritas are a must  I tried most of the dishes but my favorite dish is the Enchiladas Classicas.
Eldorado Cafe,84,Eldorado is a great place. Tonight the staff was amazing and the food and drinks were great. I had food at the bar and takeout for my husband.  The manager even checked in on me and he handled everything inside the restaurant and out. Thank you again for being great    
Eldorado Cafe,85,How have I not left a review here yet  Like it s the best little mom and pop Mexican restaurant around  Salsas are amazing and it s my favorite place for good enchiladas. Great atmosphere and drinks all around.
Eldorado Cafe,86,Mexican-ish comfort food with many unique dishes. They never disappoint  from shiny ribs to Joel s happy plate  and their margs are perfection.
Eldorado Cafe,87,This place is consistently amazing  The food is always perfect  and I mean always. I ve eaten inside a minimum of 40 times  and have picked up curbside a handful of times  and it s always accurate  fresh and delicious.  On top of the incredible food they treat you like family  in a good way   and they care about people  animals  and their community.
Eldorado Cafe,88,Came by for lunch and everything was delicious  We ordered the Enchiladas Verde with mushrooms. Would highly recommend the enchilada plates. Also shared the tater tot taco and a mojito. So glad we gave this place a try 
Eldorado Cafe,89,All those stars are right. We were told there d be a 10 minute wait  and it was 8 minutes. The staff were quick  friendly and didn t even blink when we used the paper menu and not a phone for ordering. The chips and salsa came quickly with our drinks  non alcoholic. I only like Coronas in frosted glasses when I m in a Mexican restaurant   but I did have a Mexican sugar free Coke and the flavor was new and very refreshing. Food came promptly and was very tasty. Mine was accompanied by 3 steamed corn tortillas rolled in foil  and they were delicious. We were asked if we needed anything more a couple of times during the meal. It is a fine restaurant with pleasant staff  and we ll be back.
Eldorado Cafe,90,Outstanding breakfast place. If you are in the mood for some unique and delicious Mexican food  this place is it.   Menu is diverse. You ll find some traditional Mexican favorites as well as unique and flavorful adaptations.   The Red chilaquiles were amazing. Tender chunks of carnitas in a delicious sauce draped over some fresh tortilla prices with a fried egg on top. Yummy.   The tacos were equally outstanding. Lots of different options to choose from. We really enjoyed the Izzy and Matt s taco. Fresh tortillas. Simply delicious.   Service was fast and friendly.
Eldorado Cafe,91,Get the salsa x  Best authentic Mexican food in town. EVERYTHING is fresh. Ingredients are thought out. Atmosphere is colorful and fun.
Eldorado Cafe,92,We just ordered lunch over the phone.   Super nice Lady named Ella answered.  Her immediate and sincere kindness was infectious      We had no idea what to order so we asked her if she had any  healthy  suggestions... she recommended     Romaine Wedge with grilled chicken and black pepper goat cheese    Carne Guisada Taco Bowl with Romaine   Totally went with it.  Asked her a few questions  she remained insanely patient the entire time.  She said our order be ready in 15 minutes.  I pulled up curbside pickup in exactly 15 minutes.  Texted in my parking space   and within seconds  a chipperly young lady delivered.  I rolled down my window  I had a feeling... so I asked - it was Ella.  I m sort of familiar with the restaurant industry  employees come and go.  Good people are hard to find and even harder to keep.  Who ever is responsible for hiring Ella  good job   Hopefully you will be able to keep her for a while   She s a darn good human being and without any doubt an exceptional employee.  We will be back.  Almost just because of Ella...   and the food    She deserves 6 Stars 
Eldorado Cafe,93,Update  tried the Philly cheese steak torta  and was not too impressed. The steak is cut too thick. Everything else in the previous review still stands.
Eldorado Cafe,94,Excellent food  attentive staff  amp  reasonable prices.  Some of the best Mexican food I ve had in the Austin area.
Eldorado Cafe,95,Amazing. The food was delicious  the atmosphere was fun and lively  and Joel  the owner  and Kelsey  our server  were so friendly  attentive  accommodating  and just great people. We had a blast and will definitely be back 
Eldorado Cafe,96,First time here came for Saturday mid morning brunch.This place was great the service  the atmosphere and food made it a great dining experience. We ordered mainly for the breakfast menu- the food was well prepared and delicious. We ordered the Huevos Texicans -Nomad Plate  Gloria sChilaquiles Eldorito Pie and a homemade buttermilk biscuit. Plus beer and other adult beverages all were well prepared and very delicious. With the wonderful atmosphere and great service and outstanding food I recommend you give it a try and I hope to return soon to try some more of the delicious offerings from the extended menu.
Eldorado Cafe,97,Great food and drinks  excellent and friendly service  be prepared to wait but worth it.  Details We go to El Dorado at least every other week. It s become our neighborhood Mexican restaurant and we are lucky to have it  Joel  the owner  is usually around and chatting with everybody. All of the staff is really friendly. It s always packed. Expect an hour wait minimum on weekends. Luckily  the wait goes fast because their bar drinks are excellent.   All of the food is excellent. Not typical Tex Mex but a nice blend of Mexican with a twist. We ve pretty much eaten and drank our way through the menu so I ll list a few of my favorites.  Thunder Rosa Taco - love  love  love this taco  Also my son s go-to taco. Named after a local female wrestler. What s not to like about a taco with steak and bacon  I like it on corn tortillas. Caution  The roasted pepper on this taco is scorching   El Sin Nombre - basically a margarita but made with mezcal. Nice and smoky but watch out  it s strong.  El Guaco Taco - when you want something smaller. It s a crispy taco with black beans and guac. Delicious.  Enchiladas Verdes - all the enchiladas are good  nice sauces and not loaded with cheese. Verde with chicken is my recent fav. I always opt for the lados  optional sides for an extra  1  over the standard excellent rice and beans.  Mojo Veg - this is one of the lados. Tasty mix of garlicky  saut ed veggies.  Simple greens with  Pepper Goat Cheese Dressing - also a lado. Sounds weird to get a salad with Mexican food but I like the cool freshness and the goat cheese dressing is great.  Salsa X - interesting  moderately spicy salsa. Great with chips and on pretty much anything else   I ll stop there. It s all good 
Eldorado Cafe,98,This is the one  y all. Best Mexican food in Austin. And that s coming from a native Austinite who F N LOVES Mexican food  sorry Fonda  you re still my  2 .  Small place that fills up quick - make a res if you don t like waiting. Third visit yesterday  and all 3 knocked it out of the park. Creative menu  perfectly prepared - haven t tried anything that we haven t loved. And you can t have a badass plate of carnitas without a proper margarita  and these guys do not disappoint. Top shelf  El Silencio mezcal  done right. Get 3. Get an Uber. Do what you gotta. All the stars.
Eldorado Cafe,99,Very friendly   Food delicious.. 4 of us gas something different and everyone happy ... tortilla chips the best ever     And margaritas yummy too
Eldorado Cafe,100,I wish I could give 6 stars.  Excellent food.  Warm and welcoming staff.   A little skinny on the healthy desert menu.  Sorry guys  the donuts are just not woking.    I d recommend jicama drizzled with pomegranate molasses.  It s awesome and would fit the culinary theme.
Eldorado Cafe,101,One of my favorite places to Austin. Spectacular food - great staff and always wonderful service. You can not go wrong here.
Eldorado Cafe,102,I expected good  solid Tex-Mex  and this was a step above that. The service was excellent as well  our server was friendly  informative  and attentive but not intrusive  and the food came very quickly even though the place was packed. Best Tex-Mex place I ve been to on the north side  for sure.
Eldorado Cafe,103,One of my favorite restaurants in the city   Their house margs are to die for and they even have some vegan options
Eldorado Cafe,104,Eldorado Cafe is a great find. The food is wonderful. The service is beyond any I have experienced. Eldorado cafe is a true local restaurant. They even have vegan dishes so the menu has been created with all tastes in mind. Eldorado cafe is conveniently located right off Mopac. Great for a meal break while driving through Austin.  I cannot wait to go back.
Eldorado Cafe,105,Soooo good  Came here for breakfast and their salsa game is on fire  They really take their salsa seriously. I had the eggs Mexicano and my partner the eggs with shredded beef. It was so delicious we forgot to take pictures to post here. Service is great also  we will definitely be back
Eldorado Cafe,106,First take out since the onset of the pandemic. Very efficient ordering and curbside pickup.   Unfortunately chicken enchiladas and mojo chicken were not up to standards we experienced pre-covid while dining in -person. Portions small for price  especially mojo chicken -- skimpy little pieces of chopped chicken.  16.95    But the most off-putting aspect was the person who took my order over the phone. I felt bullied into agreeing to a 15  tip. I know it has been tough on the restaurant industry. But why is it a norm now to expect a tip for no service  food untasted  and payment in advance    Unlikely to return.
Eldorado Cafe,107,This place doesn t look a lot from outside  but the food is delicious and its clean inside. I m a vegetarian  and I got the enchiladas classicas and I wasn t disappointed. The ancho chile sauce was a little sweet not spicy at all. I like more spice so I added the hot sauces to spice up the enchilada. We also ordered the guacamole which a little limey but I like tang. My drink was pretty boozy but I like my drinks a little stiff. Overall great place would come back again. The staff was wonderful and friendly. I loved the hot sauce so much they even offered to box some of it for me to take home.
Eldorado Cafe,108,Literally everything is good. Breakfast  enchiladas  chicken fried steaks  nothing I ve tried is disappointing
Eldorado Cafe,109,The food there is like candy. Amazing. So good. Took me by surprise. So many choices  traditional and also items on the menu with some great adaptations and twists. Again  really really really goo.
Eldorado Cafe,110,Excellent find  Food was great  The owner was running the place  everything was very well organized. We sat at the bar  they had awesome drinks  Not being from Austin the owner gave us a list of places to try while we were there. I will definitely come back anytime I m in Austin..
Eldorado Cafe,111,Excellent food and drink and great service  I ve never had a bad meal here and the margaritas are wonderful. I also love the 5 dip sampler. Can t go wrong 
Eldorado Cafe,112,As newbies to Austin  we were fortunate enough to come across the Eldorado Cafe pretty quickly. Joel and his staff are amazingly friendly  the food is down right delicious  and the service is great  It s my husband s birthday today  and we are ordering take-out from the Eldorado   It was his first pick    Here are some of our favorites  Rene s Awesome Enchiladas  my fave   Suizas Enchiladas with chicken and  Enchiladas Classicas with chicken  my husband s go-to . If you are into crazy hot sauce  not me  this is my husband   then try their El Scorpio sauce   . You have been warned on the heat level 
Eldorado Cafe,113,Salsa salsa salsa   Right off the bat we tried a couple of their more mild salsas and simply fell in love. Their chips were nice and warm  too.  As far as the actual food items off the menu  I was super impressed with their staples. Their beans  potato sweet potato hash is amazing and their sauces rock. All their food seems really yummy but a bit on the salty side for me. Otherwise I have no complaint. The flavors are amazing and everything came out piping hot. This is the new hot spot and I totally get why.  Prices can be a bit on the high side but I would say for the quality and service it was still pretty good.  One tip for the wait is to go around 11-11 15 and you won t wait at all on a weekday    Parking is ample and they even have a handicap ramp right in front of their door.
Eldorado Cafe,114,There is so much Mexican in this city  but this by far tops it for me. Best chips and salsa I have ever had  The food is flavorful  amp  love the variety of options. Friendly staff too 
Eldorado Cafe,115,Can I choose six stars  This is hands down our favorite restaurant in Austin. I just love hanging here. Drinks are great and they have a solid mocktail menu. Food is consistently delicious. We love all the staff and feel a great sense of community at this spot. I can t recommend it enough. My go to is the Salsa X and chicken verde enchiladas. Queso is epic as well 
Eldorado Cafe,116,Good. Not great. I dont know why all the best Mexican restaurants on Yelp here in Austin are so gringo   amp  I m white.  I miss San Antonio. Since moving to Austin I ve had some serious trouble finding good Mexican restaurants.  Message me if you know the spots      Anyway  food was fresh. I got enchiladas Verdes. Verde sauce was too sour. Wasn t bad just not amazing or mind-blowing. I still ate my whole plate.  -    Now  what was great was the spicy salsa I requested. I drowned my plate in it. Yum. It was actually spicy. Yay 
Eldorado Cafe,117,First off  I m not going strictly off my own food for this review as I ordered something I ve had much better elsewhere. That said  everything  other than that one thing - the queso and chips  salsa  and a few bites from my wife s plate  were pretty spectacular. My wife had two cocktails and I  a black cherry soda. As a nice ending to our meal  I ordered their Sopapilla Cheesecake  and holy crap  it was totally  amazeballs     This place is almost always packed and wait times can be long  but after finally trying it  I can personally attest to any wait being well worth it.   Price wise  it s not Chuy s cheap  but not quite as pricy as say Fonda San Miguel. The Eldorado Caf  hovers somewhere in between. For two of us with an appetizer  two cocktails  a soda  two entree s and dessert  the bill came to  72 plus tip. Not what I was expecting to pay for a regular meal out but again  glad I tried it. I did leave stuffed which is far more than I can say for a local sushi place that I left hungry after shelling out a couple hundred clams. So even though they re a little higher than the millions of other Tex-Mex Spanish Mexican food joints in Austin  I still give Eldorado a strong   rating 
Eldorado Cafe,118,Yeah babe  any night any day  in the mornin in the late  say the word  and I m on my way.  Rollin eyes in the back of my head  making my toes curl- Yeah  you got that yummy-yum  that yummy-yum  that yummy yummy    Listen  sometimes the Biebs gets it right and when it comes to El Dorado   Baby  you got that yummy yummy     I never thought love could feel this strong so fast.  We barely know each other but it all happened so fast.  I ve heard of your reputation  after all- you get around.  I guess the intrigue finally brought me in and yes  you are worth the wait lines. I m not even jealous with how much attention you get.  I m just so in love with you.  El Dordado  you make the Tex Mex name so proud.  Your enchiladas give me life.  I ll always be there for you.  Forever yours  Joy
Eldorado Cafe,119,Great service and food  Everyone was friendly and attentive  felt like a great place to hang out.
Eldorado Cafe,120,Because the ownership invited me and in adherence to her own wishes  I am now fully publicly  announcing for anybody who cares to hear that I WILL NOT be back to Eldo-ripoff cafe  refer to my original post  I had a terrible meal  and the price was way too high for the swill they served me. I will let everybody who cares to  know exactly what my beef is  now that you ve challenged and insulted me. Good job using your words. El Dorado  1 LLC  Aust n  took 1 million dollars in forgivable PPP loans in 2020 and 2021  and the management  wants to blame their exorbitant prices on COVID expenses. Please. It s all public record. So no.
Eldorado Cafe,121,This place is just the best. Great food and awesome people. We have yet to try something that we don t like. Also  they have done a great job of taking care of their people and their customers throughout the pandemic - no easy task  but very appreciated  We will continue to be regulars here for as long as they re around.   Here s a few of our favorites from the years that we ve been eating here  -Salsas  Avocado  Salsa X  Verde -Apps Small Plates  Queso  Honolulu Pork Tacos  Papas Rellenas  Supa Chalupa -Breakfast  Izzy s Taco  Migas Taco  Big Papa Taco  Biscuit  amp  Jam  don t sleep on the jam    any of the egg plates -Lunch Dinner  Joel s Happy Plate  Carne Guisada  Enchiladas Suizas  Sides  Las Calabasas  Cheez N Rice 
Eldorado Cafe,122,I cannot stop eating here  I am addicted. Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin. Everything from the drinks to apps and food  outstanding
Eldorado Cafe,123,The food is outstanding. We always take our out-of-town guests here. I ve never been disappointed with any of their menu items.
Eldorado Cafe,124,The enchiladas was amazing and margaritas was great  all staff was friendly and restaurant was very clean
Eldorado Cafe,125,Eldorado is one of the places hitting it out of the park during the pandemic. They take safety measures seriously. Their curbside pickup is perfectly done. You park at a space with a numbered chair  let them know you re there  and they bring the food to the chair. When the employee is at a safe distance you grab your order from the chair. Brilliant. They ve also closed a couple times to assess how to operate as safely as possible and to ensure some COVID-positive employees had time to recover. They have been transparent about their approach and situations on their social media. I ll be forever loyal to this great place. So glad they re part of the neighborhood 
Eldorado Cafe,126,My Freddie s Plate was a tissue paper thin egg topped with tons of cheese and the picadillo could not be found. Really  really small portions with a big price. Too many other places to go with great food  large servings and better service.  Hint  don t sit at the bar to eat. 
Eldorado Cafe,127,Before heading to the airport  I had to make one last stop for breakfast in Texas. Saw the reviews on Yelp and Austin media and made a stop at Eldorado Cafe.   Easily found a parking spot in the lot of this small strip mall and although it was a Saturday morning  the wait was only 5 minutes before a table was ready.   Decor is eclectic Tex Mex with bright vivid colors on the walls and chairs ranging from turquoise to rust.   Bloody Mary-a bit spicy and practically a meal  but good Eldorado Queso-Good. Hard to find places that do queso right Huevos Rancheros-Good  but the ranchero sauce was a bit on the bland side.  Service was quick  but distracted.  I did not try their specialty items  so maybe I ordered the wrong items. Given the reviews  I probably set my expectations too high.
Eldorado Cafe,128,El Dorado has the best food around.  I prefer the carnitas but everything is delicious.  I have never had a bad meal at Eldorado whether it s take home or in restaurant.
Eldorado Cafe,129,We ordered ahead through catering for 22 people. Communication excellent. Delivery seamless. Food delicious. They had cards by each tray with ingredience which was excellent. Great experience all around  
Eldorado Cafe,130,Amazing food  5 star service  a must visit in North Austin. Banado Plate  amp  Salsa X is our go-to order   The margs and queso are also top notch
Eldorado Cafe,131,Their carnitas is on point and rivals some of the best carnitas I had in Cali. Make sure to also get that with their cheesy rice.  Fresh tortillas too I mean sheesh this place is a complete gem.
Eldorado Cafe,132,Good stuff  Probably the best Mexican I have found around town. But  full disclosure  I judge Mexican food real tough.  However  you will not be disappointed if you go. Definitely a local spot and a family joint. There were 8 or 9 tables with high chairs. Staff is good and quick too   Enjoy 
Eldorado Cafe,133,I LOVE THIS PLACE.   The food is ALWAYS ON POINT   The service is always good    I ordered on favor the food was fresh and delicious.   So comforting during this time.   I found a block of fresh corn in my rice.   You know how you take it off the Cobb and some kernels stay together   It made me happy   . Not only am I stuffing my face with this oooey goooey cheesy pork burrito.    I m eating FRESH veggies
Eldorado Cafe,134,Excellent food and brunch options - kid friendly  chips and salsa are must try  can we crowded on weekends so reservations recommended
Eldorado Cafe,135,I think I ve already reviewed this place. I don t care  it s so good it warrants a new note. Today I got Carnitas con Huevo breakfast taco. DELICIOUSSSSS  Fluffy eggs  juicy mexican pulled pork  avocado slices and a tangy avocado salsa to top it off. All for less than  4.
Eldorado Cafe,136,Dude. This place is the BOMB  I cannot believe I didn t find it sooner    The wait staff are all great. Their margaritas are super fresh  The watermelon is by far my favorite. And omg the food       The food is so beyond great  I highly recommend the salsa sampler. Every single salsa is amazing so it s hard to choose a favorite. But it s worth trying them all 
Eldorado Cafe,137,We found this spot on a Yelp search for Mexican food at my daughter s request for her birthday.   The spot is unassuming  but worth the stop. We had to wait a short time for a table but much less than quoted at check-in.   The food was fantastic   We started with the salsa sampler and the guac. Excellent guac but couldn t suggest the salsa sampler. Two were so spicy that we wasted. The chips are off the chain. Served piping hot  worth the stop all by themselves.     We sampled enchiladas and our daughter ordered breakfast. I also had the chalupa combo. Food arrived promptly and fresh.  Everything was fabulous. We would definitely come again.
Eldorado Cafe,138,Yeah  any place that serves chips and salsa while you wait for breakfast is pretty solid in my book.  We came here on Sunday morning and not shocking  there was a wait. But we swooped in on some seats at the counter and it was smooth sailing from there. Our bartender was awesome  quick  friendly and gave us some suggestions being first timers. It all looked good and I dig that the menu doesn t give you too many things to order from. I ordered the Nomad place and it was a filling meal before we went on our hike.   Oh yeah  the free chips and salsa beforehand probably helped established a nice base in my tummy as well. Can you tell I love that they serve chips and salsa  Random but should be mandatory at more breakfast places 
Eldorado Cafe,139,It doesn t work for me  a born and raised Mexican and foodie. That said  the colorful  cozy room was full of happy people devouring their not-really-Mexican food. This is truly  Hecho en Tejas  stuff. And that s okay   Hey  I like... no  make that _adore_ Americanized Chinese take-out food such as sweet and sour chicken and egg rolls  so I get that it s a matter of  what you were raised with.   We ate a wide assortment of dishes and none of them would compel me to return.   For atmosphere  the place gets an A . And the service was hyper friendly though a wee bit disorganized.
Eldorado Cafe,140,Eldorado Cafe  Where have you been all my life  I had no idea  y all. I ve passed this place SO many times and just didn t know what I was missing out on. Which was really tasty  high-quality food. I tried their salsa sampler  and it s divine. You get to try some super spicy ones  I think the yellow one was spiciest   smokey ones  and fresh ones. Worth getting it  I also got the Carnitas Cubanos with their Calabasas side. It was so fresh and different from other Mexican spots. I can t wait to explore more on their menu.
Eldorado Cafe,141,So. so. good. So. so. worth visiting. Okay  I have so much to say  where to start  Wait time  We had no wait time and were seated right away  arriving at 4pm on Thursday for happy hour  but when we left at 6 30pm  there was a line out the door and it was packed. Know what I know now  if we were forced to wait  I would have. Absolutely. Food  We ordered the Eldorado Salsa Sampler  I really liked the Salsa Fresca  Chileverda  and Salsa X  with Salsa X being the tastiest one and yes  the El Scorpio is hot and I can handle heat  and the Eldorado Queso  delicious. real. legit. queso. . I was a tad disappointed in the chips  which did not seem homemade to me  as they tasted bag-eqsue.  Also  they were sometimes too hard or stale or something  but I figured it was just a bad bag or something. We also got the margarita on happy hour and it was so good. I love that they do not put sour mix in their margs and it was genuinely just a few ingredients that made a very tasty marg. My husband ordered the Carnitas Cubanos and I ordered the Enchiladas Verde. The Carnitas Cubanos plate was amazing. Truly. Crispy  juicy  tender  crunchy  addicting  addicting  addicting. I m literally already thinking about if I were to ever go back  not in Texas anymore    that I would be ordering the carnitas. We also had one Supa Chalupa to split  which was tasty. I love tha the tostada shell was homemade and the carnitas  again  to die for. I just have to say something about the queso. I grew up in Texas and later in life  moved to a state that doesn t offer good  real queso anywhere. To eat the queso at Eldorado was a dream. It was creamy  liquidy and not too thin  thick and not too stringy  it was perfect. Service Ambiance  Kind  patient  helpful and friendly. They have a lot of salsas to try and they walked through each with our group and talked about specials and menu changes and options and more. I can imagine that they talk about these things all night long  over and over  and yet our waitress somehow made it seem as if we were the only ones who mattered and she was not tired of repeating herself. The ambiance of the restaurant feels unassuming  homey  and almost small-town  like. It s super cute. Love this place and highly recommend 
Eldorado Cafe,142,Delicious food  and great service. The entire staff is so friendly and welcoming. This was my first time here and they really make every guest feel like a regular. Great spot.
Eldorado Cafe,143,My husband loves the chicken enchilada mole  It s his favorite accessible  casual go-to Mexican restaurant during COVID for take-out on a Friday night.
Eldorado Cafe,144,Great food  amp  service during pandemic   I respect their incredibly hard work to make  amp  serve takeout food during the 2020 2021 pandemic.  I m a devoted customer now  Shiny ribs - fabulous   Short Ribs Salpicon fab. too - as are all meat dishes.  Enjoy all enchiladas too    Wonderful locally owned restaurant 
Eldorado Cafe,145,Another great visit to a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. The food was outstanding... I chose and you can not go wrong with their  salsa x   it is x and not 10  wonderful balance of great taste  amp  heat  and the migas plate  is still one of the best I have ever had .  Coffee was good and they kept my cup full.  The memosa hit the spot    Bottom line - great spot  wonderful fresh food. Attentive and friendly service. I will be back 
Eldorado Cafe,146,Good vibes  even better food.  I ve said it before and I ll say it again. There is always something more to discover in Austin. The wife and I have an axiom   If you want incredible Mexican or Chinese food  seek out the strip mall.  It did not let us down with Eldorado Cafe.  Brunch was an absolute madhouse when we arrived at 10am. Line out the door  people waiting in the sun  anarchy in the streets  the whole nine yards. We waited 30-40 minutes  indoors  we re not heathens  before we were seated. While waiting  I remarked at how relatively quiet it was. The restaurant is essentially one large room  it was packed  and yet it was still possible to carry on a conversation.  Fresh from the gym  we were starving and went HAM on the menu  Queso  Good  but relatively unremarkable  Salsa Sampler  Salsa X was watery  I was hoping a salsa named  El Scorpio  might have some bite  but instead it was pleasantly herbaceous  Thunder Rosa Taco  Sirloin   Bacon   Jalapenos.  Easily the hottest thing we ordered. Surprisingly filling   Carnitas Cubanos  Get  em. Just do it. I could have eaten plates upon plates of these carnitas.   Honolulu Pork mini-tacos  They re small  but you get four of them. Succulent pork  nicely balanced by the pineapple slaw.   It s worth going to Eldorado on the merit of the food alone. But as we were cramming food into our maws  we noticed something odd. Every employee was smiling. And I mean every.single.one. In between frantic bouts of busting ass on a hectic Sunday morning  they were stopping to chat  embracing one another  and genuinely acting like great human beings. What  During arguably the busiest part of the weekend  Every employee looked like they loved to be there.  As we were wrapping up  a more senior employee swung by to chat us up and thank us for coming out  as it was our first time. We asked what the secret to restaurant happiness was   They just treat us like family  so we treat one another like family.    Sometimes it s just that simple.
Eldorado Cafe,147,COVID-19 Service - excellent.  Many parking stations available.  Telephone your order  pay  and pick a spot.  I ordered a crispy taco and it was ready in 5 minutes.  Taco was pretty good -
Eldorado Cafe,148,This has become my favorite spot  There s usually a slight wait but they are pretty accurate with timing. Their breakfast plates are amazing     Love their fresh chips and their salsa choices. Scorpion salsa is spicy but is my favorite  it s so tasty   They have queso with black beans  pico  and guacamole in it  hands down the best I ve had   Service is good  the manager comes over each time we re there to make sure everything is good which is a nice touch. This is easily one of my favorite brunch spots
Eldorado Cafe,149,My oh my. I ve been waiting to have dinner here for months. However  on this day I only had time to stop in for happy hour drinks and snax. Had the salsa sampler  supa queso and two happy hour crispy beef tacos. The only words i can think of right now about the food is   freaking amazing.   Our wait staff was friendly and told us the food was amazing when she greeted us. I can t wait to go back for the full dinner experience. I seriously want to try everything on the menu. Everything 
Eldorado Cafe,150,We came for a late breakfast.  Didn t realize you needed a reservation for inside seating but we were able to get a table outside.  Ordered a couple of breakfast tacos and they were fantastic.
Eldorado Cafe,151,This place is amazing  Highly recommend the short rib enchiladas  margaritas  and all of the legit salsas.  Give this place a try.....you won t be disappointed.
Eldorado Cafe,152,Blown away by the place.  Went in on a whim with my wife and kids.  TOP NOTCH SERVICE  especially the head bartender.  Got to get the Salsa Sampler  guys     WOW.
Eldorado Cafe,153,I don t appreciate being called  Yelpey  when you could not deliver an app - which was pre-made and waiting in the kitchen - in over 20 minutes.  Be frank...owning a restaurant  what would you say if this happened to you 
Eldorado Cafe,154,After a long  amp  full day of work  picking up dinner from one of my favorites  Eldorado Cafe ATX.  They only have pick-up  amp  delivery  amp  are considered a compliant restaurant.  They have a good ordering  amp  pick up system.  I m so glad   I can t wait   Yummm    I got a variety of tacos and the roasted potatoes  peppers   amp  onions.  I also got the 2 oz side of queso and guacamole.  Yum 
Eldorado Cafe,155,Visited for my first time today--walked in and ordered takeout.  The verse enchiladas with chicken were very tasty. The potato hash and the beans  similar to charro and unexplained to me  1 extra  were extremely skimpy.  Quite disappointing. If not for the tablespoon and a half servings of the sides I would have rated my experience higher. Think too many places are using the pandemic as a lingering excuse for shorting customers on portion size. This may lead to lost business.
Eldorado Cafe,156,No  complete rip-off. Once a stellar sit-down eatery  they became greedy in CoVid times.  I wondered why my fave enchilada plate went from 15- to 30-   gosh  Know why  THEY DONT GIVE YOU ANY SALSA WITH YOUR MEAL  NOT A DROP. That is EXTRA.  Who the      buys Mexican food and then has to pay EXTRA for any salsa   No one. Not this man. 20 other Mexican eateries immediately nearby would never do something as stupid as this. They want my business  and they ll get it  as El Dorado LOST ours.   Arrogance  sheer arrogance. You get your bill  and are like  Hey  wait a minute  wth is going on here. You actually are CHARGING me for something EVERY Mexican restaurant gives away as their calling card  I will NEVER come back.
Eldorado Cafe,157,Good casual dining spot. We have been there for both lunch and dinner. Friendly staff  and good service. Food is a little different than generic Tex Mex but good nonetheless   Definitely recommend 
Eldorado Cafe,158,If you love salsa and delicious Mexican food this is you re new favorite restaurant  Their salsas are awarding winning and range from mild to tipping Scoville scales. They are so great. The scorpion pepper salsa is the hottest level of heat I can handle regularly. It s straight addicting. Their menu is full of variety and some unique house specials.   The one down fall of this place is just the location. It s small which makes wait times a little long and it feels like you re on top of the other tables around you. But so worth it  Just bring a small group.
Eldorado Cafe,159,Epic  So amazing. We are in town from Southern CA  and this was some of the best Mexican food I have ever had.  I am a sucker for great Salsa and this did not disappoint. We are in town for a week and I will be making my way back again normally on vacation I won t hit a restaurant more than once  but it was this good. Service was above and beyond.
Eldorado Cafe,160,I  heart  this place   When describing it to my friends I refer to it as an upscale Taco Deli with a larger variety of options  I also  heart  Taco Deli .  Since my first visit I ve been back weekly.....my delay in writing this review might be for selfish reasons  I don t need this place to get any more popular  as it s already difficult to grab a table for dinner on a random Tuesday.  I don t often rave about chips  amp  salsa  and almost never about queso.  But both are on my  MUST  list whenever I come here.  Their salsas and the house queso are amazing   My favorite of their salsas is the spicy  creamy and dreamy Salsa X  and the citrusy fresh Avocado Salsa.  Their guacamole is also great. The corn chips are the perfect texture for scooping up all the goodness.  The enchiladas classica  verde and suizas are all great.  The beef and chicken in their dishes are high quality  as are all the other ingredients.  But what may separate them from other Tex-Mex places is their creativity with fabulous sauces and salsas.  The El Cabo salad is my go-to when I want something on the lighter side. I also love that for a modest up charge you can swap out rice and beans for more creative and tastier sides  such as the 3 Potato Hash and the La Calabasas  squash and zucchini hash w pepitas .  It should go without saying  this place also knows how to put together awesome breakfast tacos.
Eldorado Cafe,161,Went back today in-room dining for first time since pandemic. Food is better than ever. New salsas  bowls  breakfast goodness. So thankful this team made it through. Eldorado is a gem of North Central and we appreciate you all. Y all take great care of your customers and your hard work and amazing food does not go unnoticed. Thank you 
Eldorado Cafe,162,Great food and friendly staff   Love the crispy tacos and nice neighborhood restaurant.
Eldorado Cafe,163,I came back for dinner and while the 1 he wait is a drag  we all enjoyed the evening.   The Shiny Ribs app was delicious.  There are 4 so good luck fighting over the last one if you are a party of 3.  We also had the Supa Queso which was delicious   but too runny.  Add depth and it would be phenomenal.  The red   roasted salsa and green medium salsas were absolutely delicious.   My papas rellenos were perfectly colored and crisp.  Use the cabbage as garnish  don t just let it act as a bed. Delicious.   My friend got the Joel and loved it.  The other gal got the short rib enchilada and said it was  good  but not great.   My paloma drink s  was delicious.  Our server was really sweet.  Cherry pie skillet was alright.  The lemon curd special dessert was GREAT.  A note to management  our table was approached  twice by who wr guessed was an owner and or GM... Introduce yourself   gentlemen   it s a bit odd to just walk up to a table without saying your name and position.   Overall   we d love to come back.
Eldorado Cafe,164,So glad I bookmarked this place a long time ago...  My mom and a friend of mine arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and the place was hopping. The 25 min wait flew by thanks to the wine shop next door  which gives out three free tastings daily.   Once seated  I asked the server if they served carne guisada  one of my favorite dishes. He said no  but brought out a sample of their carne adovado. This feels a bit sacrilegious to say but adovado is better than guisada. The owner  Joel  came over and explained that they created the adovado by combining elements of guisada and traditional Texas red chili. It is phenomenal. Even if you do not order this on your next visit  at least ask for a sample.   Also be sure to try out El Scorpio  their hottest hot sauce. TBH I didn t find it terribly hot. However  it does have a strong kick and a very unique flavor. I loved it.   Definitely going to try El Dorado s again in the future.
Eldorado Cafe,165,This is a family favorite   We ve been going ever since they opened and have never been disappointed. Whether we go for breakfast  lunch or dinner  the food is always phenomenal as are the drinks. Joel has a great team there and we recommend it to anyone who asks  and sometimes when they don t . If you haven t been  you need to check it out.
Eldorado Cafe,166,I had a lovely ladies lunch here on a Tuesday.  It was busy.  Everyone liked her food choice.  I had the chicken salad which is called El Cabo  with a side of black beans.  Salad was nice  chicken was grilled just right  moist and flavorful.  Avocado was tasty and ripe.  Chips were good.  Salsa just ok.  Service was just fine with our party of seven.    I travelled from downtown to meet friends which I wouldn t do just to Visit this restaurant again but if I was in the area and hungry  I would dine here again.  Probably a five by this local neighborhood standards  3.75 or 4.0 by Austin foodie standards.
Eldorado Cafe,167,I ll make this one short and to the point.  I have no idea why folks give this place such a high rating. It must be one of those  nostalgic  locations that have gone to the wayside  as many others in this town. At the time of my visit  service was horrendous. I understand that Austin has its share of sketchy folks working as waiters bartenders  etc  sadly  this place fits the stereotype. The highly processed chips did not compliment the salsa and the food was unmemorable. I was hoping the drinks were better  however the margarita I received was very unbalanced.  This was definitely a one and done.
Eldorado Cafe,168,Just say yes  I ve enjoyed breakfast  lunch  and dinner on the same day  Their takeout is easy and fast. Super friendly  great food  try ALL of the sauces.
Eldorado Cafe,169,Place was amazing  food was great and service was on point  Highly recommend trying them out.
Eldorado Cafe,170,I love tex-mex and the was amazing.  I was expecting a lot and was so impressed.  We had to wait on a weekday around 1 00 so they are busy a lot.  I LOVED their salsas--you can order a sampler platter and that was so great so try everything--I literally could not pick a favorite and asked if they sold jars of it to take on the airplane home. For the apps  we had the cheese stuffed taco thingy--I cannot remember the name but they were good. The enchilada entree  with mole  was awesome.  The veggie enchilada with potato was also great. Great margarita.    Just overall really great food  kid friendly and great service.  COME HERE      I am confused at the negative reviews but they seem to be more on service  ours was great  and on charging for salsa  you get two included .
Eldorado Cafe,171,If I were to choose a go-to Tex Mex spot  it d be here. For. Sure.   I gotta say that the Sandinista with the watermelon agua fresca is sooooo delightful and refreshing--especially on a warm summer evening    I got the enchiladas suizas and thoroughly enjoyed it. Maybe I haven t had enchiladas in a while  but woah  these were surprisingly good  The creamy salsa verde sauce with the cheese wasn t heavy at all. The flavors were definitely there  and the beef filling had wonderful spice and was really tender.   For dessert  we got the sopapilla cheesecake which was... just wow. The pastry dough had layers upon layers. You could taste the texture contrast from the crunchy exterior to the flakier middle and then the soft doughy interior and then you reach the cheesecake goodness... top it off with some cinnamon and honey... yum  Might as well top it off with some ice cream too    Totally want to come back here  And definitely for the sopapilla cheesecake 
Eldorado Cafe,172,This was one of our main event brunch places before the pandemic hit in 2020 and we finally went back for the first time in a couple years. It s still good but it probably will be taken out of our roster for go-to brunch places. Why  Two reasons  1.  They no longer are open on Sundays  like  SERIOUSLY  This is my boyfriend and I s ideal day to do brunch  having a brunch place that isn t open Sundays is like having a bar that closes at 5pm  and 2.  They also without warning stopped serving breakfast items on the menu after 11am  would have been nice if their menu or website said something about this  . The food overall is still pretty good and the sauces they bring out are amazing  get the salsa X   and portions are good though the enchiladas I had were in a cream that was a bit sour for my taste. I d like to review based on the breakfast but once again I can t because I came here expecting it and then when we got our order taken at 11 15 they said they weren t serving breakfast anymore. Hopefully next time I get to try it and see if it s still good  but with their new days of operation and breakfast hours who knows when that will even be. Whatta shame 
Eldorado Cafe,173,Best of the best  I would highly recommend this place for the food mainly but the ambiance is fun and funky.
Eldorado Cafe,174,Sooooooo  it s  not tex mex   but it s the ONLY PLACE YOU SHOULD EVEN PRETEND TO EAT TEX MEX      but seriously  you really must eat here. be prepared for a wait  but everything on the menu is worth it   Also  the staff are all superb 
Eldorado Cafe,175,Two words. Shiny Ribs. Four more words. Honolulu Pork Mini Tacos. Want more  Carnitas Cubanos.  I m a fan and will likely increase this review to a 5 star hard-on after I ve tried more of their fare
Eldorado Cafe,176,Overwhelmingly good food  our plates were nice and hot. Everything was flavorful and tasted authentic. The owner was nice enough to come by our table and say hello too  Definitely recommend.
Eldorado Cafe,177,I hesitate to write this review  because you can still get a table most of the time  but I know that s going to change  and quickly   This place is simply wonderful   Everything on the menu is well thought out  beautifully presented and delicious. Try something new  you won t be disappointed 
Eldorado Cafe,178,A new favorite  Menu had the classic TexMex dishes plus lots of new twists. We tried the short rib enchiladas and an appetizer called a pushka   sp  . Both were excellent. In addition they have a variety of salsas to choose from. My favorite was the avocado green salsa  mild . We will definitely be back
Eldorado Cafe,179,Like the atmosphere. We were seated within 5 minutes on a Saturday around 11am. Love the prices. All the food was fresh  delicious. The staff was really attentive. We had two guys besides our waiter that came by the table to ask how everything was. The salsa flight is delightful and I loved that I could easily eat keto here with their bowl options. Their mini tacos looked beautiful and although i could only eat the meat they were delightful my boyfriend said  colorful presentation too and i just effing love a mini taco. Too cute not to like. Will def be coming back. Once I m off this diet I m going to slam one of their Agua frescas  Highly recommend.
Eldorado Cafe,180,What a great place with people that really do seem trying to give you a good experience.  It s a fun looking place. Well lit  free fairly fast wifi. The portions or generous. The service is attentive and friendly. If you like tex mex and find potatoes comforting this is definitely the place for you. Potato flautas  Potato flautas  Potato flautas   Though breakfast is  officially  over at 11  there are a few breakfast items like migas and chilaquiles all day. Vegetarian  Just ask and they will try to accommodate you.  Looking for a good happy hour  Yes. The friendliness seems to spill over to the clientele. Bar seating is comfortable. Bartenders always seem friendly and working to keep everyone happy. There s outdoor seating on a nice day. Only downside  It s not a secret anymore and can get crowded.  Yes  I ll be back.
Eldorado Cafe,181,We came here around brunch time on Sunday  the wait was around 25 min which was reasonable but there was open seating at the bar with full service dining so we sat there. The bartender Arturo was our server and our dining experience was amazing  mainly because of his good service  but also because of the salsas and food being delicious overall. Prices were reasonable too. We got the migas plate as well as the barcacoa tacos and the papa rellena taco - all very flavorfull and tasty. The smoky green salsa in particular was my favorite  definitely recommend it.
Eldorado Cafe,182,Well it s great to find a new breakfast brunch spot. Plus 1 had a business lunch here and raved about it so we stopped by on a Sunday AM for brunch. I usually refuse to wait in a queue to dine especially for breakfast but I m glad we did wait the 30 minutes to be seated.   Let s fill out the template. Service was fantastic  even though they were busy as heck the servers and runners kept up. We were checked on a number of times by both our competent server and the manager. One blemish  Plus 1 s bloody was pretty darn plain  not spicy and it tasted as if they forgot to shake up the mix before pouring. But the food is the star here.   Plus 1 ordered the migas plate and she was raving about it. I ordered the Freddie plate scrambled eggs dressed up rather spicy. Our clean plates testified to the awesomeness of our food. I m not sure how they do em but their black beans are fabu  I ll probably order a double portion on my next visit.   I would be remiss if I did not mention their chips and salsa. Like the heat  Then make sure you order their spicy salsa. Their tamer version is still a tad spicy but very flavorful.  The Eldorado goes right to the top of our dining rotation 
Eldorado Cafe,183,Thank you to Eldorado for your superb performance during the pandemic. Your ordering process is smooth  your pickup process is clear and very safe. We appreciate you staying with it during this difficult time 
Eldorado Cafe,184,Yummy in my tummy when I need my TexMex fix. In my neighborhood too   Friendly attentive service. Prices are reasonable for meal size.  You won t leave hungry   one of my favs.
Eldorado Cafe,185,We had Gloria s Chilaquiles and Nomad Plate. Both plates were really good and filling for  8. We also had their salsa five ways. A good way to try different salsas before picking one the next time we are there.   The place was packed at 11 30 am but we were lucky we didn t have to wait.
Eldorado Cafe,186,Really great Mexican food.  Whenever the family wants to eat out and we can t decide a place this is always our fallback.  Delicious food that never disappoints.
Eldorado Cafe,187,This must be Allandale s best kept secret    We only just discovered Eldorado Caf  when they were featuring hot sauce and tacos at the Hot Sauce Festival. Since then  we ve been dying to go.   We finally made our way over on Friday night at 6pm and were shocked when they said there was an hour wait  I convinced my husband to stay and I am so glad I did.   The food was well worth the wait.   The crispy pork dish I ordered tasted like an elevated version of Sarku Japan s chicken teriyaki. That may seem like a slight to Eldorardo  but there s a reason Sarku has a mile long line every day at lunch time.   The nachos compuesto were equally as impressive  as was the margarita that I ordered.   It seems like every person we saw leaving the building was happy. That s a good sign.   Can t wait to come back 
Eldorado Cafe,188,We stopped in around 12 30p on a Sunday..got sat right away.  Lindsay was our server and was amazing      The Queso was da bomb    I liked the spicy salsa  amp  the kids liked the mild one.  Enchiladas Suizas was spectacular   I went with chicken  beef  amp  cheese..chicken was my fav.  My husband got the Joel s Happy Plate and said it was delicious    Shiny Ribs as ordered by my 7yr old and she loved them.  My 10y old got the homemade biscuit with honey  amp  butter  it was huge      My 13 yr old got the enchiladas Classico  cheese .   We will definitely be back when we are on this side of town again   Yum yum
Eldorado Cafe,189,Authentic  authentic  authentic. The food here is always so fresh  delicious and semi-healthy for Mexican meals. It s a quaint spot with incredibly helpful staff. Michaela  our waitress  recommended a squash side and my aunt and I fell in love with it. The margaritas are  10 but very strong  Highly recommend.
Eldorado Cafe,190,Hidden spot in the north shoal creek area. Mexican comfort food. Their house made salsas are their signature. Will definitely be back to try more dishes.  El Scorpio  Their hottest salsa  not my thing - 5 10 Salsa Fresca  fresh and mild - 7 10 Habanero Salsa  On the hotter end  but their tastiest salsa - 9 10 Drink  Prickly Pear Margarita  not very strong but quite tasty - 8 10 Entre   Carn  Adovado  Slow cooked sirloin. Flavor here is really popping. It s almost too salty  but with the sides and condiments it s just about right. - 8.4 10  Overall  7.9 10  Follow me on IG  ahmadeats for all the food and attractions
Eldorado Cafe,191,I would give this a 4-5 normally  but their COVID policy has forced me to stop trying to go.  I ve been turned away 4 times now  because if the incredibly limited seating. If you want to go here  good luck.  It s a crap shoot.  It s a shame because I was a fan.  But There are many other choices in this town. This place needs to go back to work and open up their restaurant.  Silly.
Eldorado Cafe,192,My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday. The host was very surprised to hear we had a group of 10  I guess they don t normally have larger parties . They whipped us a few tables together and we were seated in a short amount of time. The restaurant was busy but we were served chips and salsa  mild and medium  and water quickly. The medium level salsa was probably the best salsa I ve ever had in a Mexican restaurant. The flavor was so unique and had a kick that was tolerable. I got the huevos rancheros that came with extra tortillas  corn or flour  of your choice. My meal was  9ish which was such a great deal considering all the food you get. It was so good and I can still conjure up the taste if I think about it now. The decor was super cute and you felt like you were in Latin America.
Eldorado Cafe,193,At first I was hesitant because my first experience was off  but I know now it was because of the stuff I picked and the waitress being new. Now that I ve been a few times I am addicted to the damn salsa    It s so good   The breakfast tacos are out of this world and so are the biscuits and gravy. I miss alborz but I wish el dorado fortune and fame  
Eldorado Cafe,194,No reservations. You may wait... Have a margarita  Make a new friend  Enjoy  Life is good  Food is good 
Eldorado Cafe,195,We decided that we wanted to try a new restaurant so I found this place on Yelp  checked out the menu and decided that we d go here for dinner.  They use an app  Resi  for reservations and I joined their waiting list so I thought.  Arrived and they were completely booked and I was told that the app is very misleading and that there is no actual waiting list.  I was clearly disappointed and told them so.  The manager overheard and told the hostess that he would personally wait on us but that the only table available was outside and it was hot.  We decided to take him up on his very kind offer.  We sat down and they told us that a table opened up and we could sit inside. Yay   They have lots of vegetarian options  great margaritas  delicious food and incredible service.  Everyone was super nice.  Great experience and looking forward to my next visit.  Highly recommend but please make sure you have a reservation  
Eldorado Cafe,196,Stopped by for brunch with my two girls and we were pleasantly surprised by the selection of food offered. My four year old who hates beans loved the ones here  They were very good. I got the chilaquiles which were tangy and delicious. The three potato hash was also very good. The tacos are a good size. My husband is a big guy and two were able to satisfy his hunger.   I also want to thank them for being accommodating to my two daughters. I often find it hard to find places that are kid friendly. However  this establishment was child friendly and the waitress was very sweet to them.   The wait was about ten minutes on this busy Saturday morning  which was not bad when the service and the food was good. Will be back 
Eldorado Cafe,197,1 30pm on a Sunday for 2- took 40 mins to get a table  but that s what we expected.   Got the SalsaX as the free table salsa. Smokey chipotle salsa  not too spicy.  Got the Supa Chalupa and the Santa Rosa taco- oh my lord they were both so good  100  worth the wait  and I ll have the exact same order next time I m here.
Eldorado Cafe,198,Stopped in here for lunch solely based on the top Yelp reviews and man  I m so glad I did. This place is too legit to quit. I was able to escape from my meetings a little early for lunch and this place was already jam-packed. I was able to get a seat at the bar and was greeted with prompt service  awesomely crunchy chips  with your choice of mild  medium  or hot salsa   and a menu that made me think I was going to have to come back again a few times to try everything that I wanted to.   I ain t scared so I went with the hot salsa. I m from NM so I figured I could take it since most place s version of  hot  is laughable to me. Well  this place delivered. It was hot but delicious. A bit of a weird color but I suspect it s because it was habaneros.   I finally settled on the carnitas plate. Oh em gee. They were tender  juicy  and had the most delicious crust with just a touch of crunch on them. They were served with an amazing salsa  guac  pickled red onions  etc. I chose the side of their version of calabacitas  I think they called them calabasas   and their green rice with the queso at the waitress s recommendation.   Have I already said OMG   Everything was to die for  fresh  and on point in terms of flavor. I cannot say enough great things about this place  it rocks.
Eldorado Cafe,199,Right offhand  Austin has about 700 places doing solid enchiladas  but only one charging  5.95 for a salsa sampler. This place. But if you go for it you probably won t be disappointed  because I think it s the best salsa in town too. I m pretty sure we re approaching first world problems here.  Eldorado Caf  is hip  amp  cool  the food is superb  and if you come here not expecting a crowd  you re delusional  What new restaurant criteria are you using these days  It s also pretty loud  amp  pricey  but if I was tasked to introduce someone to Tex-Mex tomorrow  I d bring them here - why not have it all kicked up a notch   I have only one complaint  and it s serious  If you re doing elevated Tex-Mex - my bad  I believe hipsters now call it  Lone Star Fusion  - you simply have to have a miga plate at all times. Because it s not just for breakfast anymore  especially when the ubiquitous fried egg option is offered for every other menu item. Call it something else  jack up the price or whatever  but you cannot strip the soul of Lone Star Fusion s single greatest contribution - the Miga. There will never be enough gold  even within Eldorado  to make up for that.
Eldorado Cafe,200,I have yet to find an  off time  to come to El Dorado Cafe. Every time I have visited  it has been hopping with patrons willing to wait to get a seat.  Food here is quite good and fresh.  Enchiladas suizas are served in the usual way drenched in sauce and melted cheese  served alongside black beans and rice.  Special touch at El Dorado Cafe on the enchilada plate is the crunch of fresh matchstick cut jicama and carrots.  Tortilla chicken soup is a hearty portion for an economical price for this bright and fresh meal in a bowl.  Service was everything that it needed to be.  We ve also had take-out from El Dorado.  This is a great pick-up option for me when it will be a busy evening with no time to cook.  I can place an order as I leave the office  it s ready when I get there  I pick it up on the way home and voila tasty dinner   Enchiladas are excellent options for take-out as they travel quite well.
Eldorado Cafe,201,Absolutely one of our favorite places    The food is amazing  the margaritas are delicious  And the staff is always friendly and attentive    We have been going to El Dorado since it opened  never disappointed       sometimes twice a day even     Wonderful HAPPY HOUR as well    
Eldorado Cafe,202,You ll find rainbow of salsas  lively atmosphere and hearty plates at Eldorado. I have tried to dine here a few times but was to hungry for the hour wait but finally on a Sunday afternoon we scored seating.  I like variety and was pleased to see a variety of salsas to include an avocado salsa. The verde mushroom enchiladas were generously portioned and were served with a small serving of rice and black beans. The brunch looks phenomenal and I look forward to coming back to give it a try.
Eldorado Cafe,203,La La La La La Bomba  That s what I was singing on my way out of here Saturday morning. This place is a hidden gem tucked between MoPac and Anderson in quite the unassuming strip plaza. A friend and I decided to try this out for brunch and  boy  did they not disappoint.   When you walk in you get a chic  yet cozy vibe. This place is really put together nicely. There is a full bar to your left and the floor is filled with your standard dining tables chairs  although you might can snag one of the cute cafe tables with the adorable lounge chairs  It manages to capture the Mexican style  using pops of color  without overdoing it.   As we sat down  I was pleased to see the plethora of breakfast options. You could do anything from biscuits and gravy to breakfast tacos. I thought I had settled on a simple biscuit and gravy entree  until the La Bomba made it s appearance on the table next to me... my friend and I both switched our order. Fair to say it was the most solid decision I made that day. The La Bomba comes with a thick  yet fluffy  biscuit  eggs  sausage  gravy  and CHEESE  How could you go wrong   It was a lot of food so I ended up taking half of it home  but I definitely don t feel like I paid for that much food. It was a very reasonably priced meal  leaving enough room to splurge for a Mexican Coke in a bottle.   I especially recommend this for a Saturday brunch since they can be hard to come by. Pro tip  they serve breakfast until 3 all weekend    If you re in the area  hit this place up. You ll be singing the tune with me ...  La la la la la la Bomba...
Eldorado Cafe,204,I have lots of good things to say about this place. Possibly the best twist on Mexican food I ve had   We stopped by for happy hour   dinner  and started with mango margaritas. Warning  these babies are strong.   Side note  The combination of the thick glass the marg comes in  plus the ice  makes it difficult to drink. Because of that  I drank it _really_ slowly aka it actually lasted the entire meal. Probably for the best  since it was strong  but made it hard to knock down several if that s your game plan.  We ordered queso and papas rellenas for apps. The queso is bomb.  nuff said. The papas rellenas were pretty good  but certainly not authentic by any means. A lot like mozzarella fritters with some potato thrown in there.  My friends both ordered enchiladas  while I ordered the adobo chicken  along with the 3 potato hash  and veggie hash on the side. Personally I liked the enchiladas better  but the chicken was darn good as well. And the hashes were a wonderful accompaniment to an otherwise heavy meal.  To top everything off  the service was  fantastic . Our server was incredibly friendly  despite us being those annoying people who take forever to order  change our minds  etc   and several other staff  owners   stopped by to check on us   ask about our meals. This place has great food  great vibes  great margs  what more can you ask for 
Eldorado Cafe,205,The boyfriend   you know what s different about this place  Every other Mexican food restaurant you go to  tastes like another place which tastes like another place. But nothing tastes like this place..   We ABSOLUTELY LOVE Eldorado Cafe. The food  the staff  the ambiance  THE SANDANISTA try it with a chili salt rim  . You can t go wrong here. Casual dinner  date night  Mother s day  brunch  any occasion   You ll come hungry and leave happy for sure   Cheers    P.S. Check out Justen s plate scraped clean on the left..I literally had to stop eating to write this review.
Eldorado Cafe,206,Another fabulous visit to ElDorado. Staff is always amazing. We brought friends tonight for their first visit. We were nervous that we talked to up too much. They LOVED the food and the whole experience. The wait is long  but that s because they are well loved. It s worth the wait. This is our 4th visit and I ll continue going back. It s comfort food with a deep interior flavor. Damn  this place is amazing    Edit  we ordered takeout the next night because it s that good. The waitress noticed us and said  you re back 
Eldorado Cafe,207,I m so glad we finally got to try this fantastic cafe. My wife and I tried to visit for breakfast a few weeks ago...except it was Easter Sunday.. Whoops  So we tried again last week then had to make a return visit on Sunday because it was so delicious. The restaurant is much larger on the inside than it appears from the outside. They have a full bar and 5-6 beers on draft. Additionally  they have a happy hour margarita that is pretty dang tasty for  5.  Their salsa sampler is the way to go. Try all of their offerings. I loved their salsa verde  salsa X and El Scorpio. We also got the Supa Queso which was delicious and even better with a little bit of the salsa X added in. On my first visit  I had the enchiladas verde which were stellar. Their rice and beans are top-notch as well. Second visit  I went with the huevos rancheros which were just what the doctor ordered early on a Sunday morning. I also had to sample their sopapilla cheesecake which is an absolute must. I think it would be killer with some fresh berry compote over the top. This is now our top option when we are in this part of town.
Eldorado Cafe,208,Holy smokes. Do you guys know what you ve done  In an era where places in Austin are going out of business left and right  you ve launched a brand new Tex Mex ... oid ... concept and are melting people s faces off ... Maybe this area is really grown up enough to have kick-ass neighborhood food   The tricky bit is  you guys did it by replicating a lot of what used to make the best places in this town rad ... but which folks seem to have forgotten ...  First of all  the vibe. It is SO old school Austin. The nightly specials menu had a Les Amis reference. When Joel came by the table  we got a Mad Dog and Beans reference. We felt so at home  And it s infectious. The number of folks who chatted with us   in such a happy and friendly fashion   was just rad  It seriously reminded my wife and me of the old school  90s crowds waiting outside Kerbey on Kerbey at 2am ...  And the food - we ordered an irresponsible amount  but regretted NOTHING. So amazingly good. We shared the salsa sampler  the queso  the completely insane puzchkas  and crispy tacos.   We loved all the salsas  but the Scorpio was my fave. The Salsa X was smoky and hotter than I expected   which was great   and the wife dug the Chile Verde. The queso was also super satisfying - very well seasoned.   The puzchkas - I just ... it s like potato skins and dim sum United into something delightful and terribly forbidden and I ate way too many   The tacos were likewise delicious. They were perfect crispy beef tacos. I could have eaten 20 while gaming.   Finally  I had the short rib salpicon  and my wife had the Chicken Enchiladas Suizas. The short ribs were like the best southwest pot roast ever  and the corn tortillas TOTALLY held up to the mess. The hash and the calabasas rounded out the meal with a great roasted grilled flavor.   The enchiladas were spicy and savory and ... my wife is indicating that she s going to fail this episode of Food Network Star because she can only keep repeating  Delicious   over and over again ...  It was all great. We will be back  with our 10 year old   because yes  it s a great afor kids   and all our friends.   UPDATE - went back last Friday with our 10 year old and four of our friends. Our group of seven had a great time chilling on the patio with drinks. Given the size of the group  the wait was not bad at all  and the environment is so chill   and the El Dorado Mule so spicy and sweet   that we didn t even notice.   Our waiter Eric rocked both the service and his mustache. We ordered an irresponsible amount of food - scored the Shiny Ribs this time  which were savory-salty-sweet amazingness - and everyone loved what they got. The Chi Chi Tinga was like the best spicy bbq chicken ever.   Everyone agreed that we ll definitely come back as a group again 
Eldorado Cafe,209,One of my favorite restaurants in Austin. Love their salsa  carnitas de cubanos  the steak w chimichurri  the calabazas and the charro beans  The people who own this place and who work here are so kind and friendly. I d take anyone here- a date  friends  family. Killer happy hour. I m happy to be giving them my business during the pandemic bc I want them to be around a long time. Their curbside pickup is truly hands-free and wonderfully organized.
Eldorado Cafe,210,First time in  co-worker recommended and it did not disappoint    When we arrived the wait was 40 mins but they overshot the wait  it was only maybe 20 mins.   Waitress was awesome and informative. We started w the potato sopes and it was the signal of how the rest of the meal would go.   Salsa  mild was flavorful  and chips  You can tell a lot about a place by their salsa.   Continued on w the the main dish  Joel s Happy Plate  2 Beef and 1 Cheese enchilada...tried the cheese n rice instead of the norm. Another good rec by the waitress  Camille was great    To top all off  they were out of the Sopapilla Cheesecake so we opted w the Summertime Delight...so good    The service  the cooks and the food are all worth a comeback visit and a new  go to  for Me.
Eldorado Cafe,211,Great lunch  fast  friendly service. Taco and queso were very good. Chips were fresh  not out of bag. Salsa was good. Good lunch for the price.
Eldorado Cafe,212,While I certainly adore Austin s plethora of inexpensive  often greasy Tex-Mex mainstays  every once and a while I crave some options beyond the same old refried beans and  Spanish  rice sides  or the same old chips  amp  queso  amp  salsa  one tomato red  one tomatillo green  starter. Eldorado Cafe is a good place for me to take a break from my Tex-Mex routine while still enjoying some other Latin-based flavors with a bit of spice. Plus  north side love  Don t y all know I get tired of having to drive 15 miles to downtown for everything    I love the 5 fresh salsa options  especially the extra spicy yellow El Scorpio that sort of reminds me of Tacodeli s green Do a sauce  no wonder  as one of the owners has a history with TD . Be aware that all of the salsas  and everything else  for that matter  are homemade at El Dorado  and they will charge you  5 for the pleasure of trying them all at once. Hey  it s worth it to find out which one is your favorite so you know which one to order next time you re here  Plus  you can brag that you just ate an Austin Chronicle Award Winning dish. Of course  if you re gonna have all that spicy salsa  you re going to need to cool it down with some fresh guac  and theirs is simply perfect.  A delicious hot appetizer that I haven t found on other menus around town is the papas rellenas plate. The El Dorado recipe is basically a fluffy  crispy mashed potato fritter filled with goat  amp  jack cheese - heaven in your mouth  I think you get 4 to a plate  and each one is about the size of my palm. After the salsa sampling and this  you may not have room for your entree - you ve been warned.  After all that fried goodness  my main meal is usually a  Pick 3    11  of the unique side dishes that I can t get anywhere but here  more about that in a minute   but if I ve been able to muster some willpower to limit my consumption of the starters  I like to go for Esme s Magic enchiladas  which are filled with savory mashed potatoes and topped with ancho chile sauce  shredded lettuce  purple cabbage  tomato  amp  queso fresco. It s almost a salad and I feel like I m actually eating something good for me. All of the veggie sides are tasty  but my faves are probably the Eldorado Rice  basmati with roasted green chiles  grilled corn  cilantro  amp  scallion   Las Calabasas  butternut squash  zucchini  roasted garlic  toasted pepitas  amp  basil   and the Mojo Veg  lemon garlic roasted cauliflower  carrots  peppers  amp  onions . Oh  and you can even get the rice with queso added to make  CheezNRice  if you need more variety or are missing the cheese sauce part of your food pyramid.  I ve not yet made it in for breakfast  but I like what I see on that menu  too. In addition to the usual suspects of migas and tacos  I see some biscuits  amp  gravy and a decadent maple candied bacon cinnamon roll  plus what looks like migas combined with picadillo in Freddy s Plate. And a taco that includes one of those potato fritters  Oh  I mma need to go try that real soon.  Service has been great during my lunch and dinner visits  but I will say that the place has been crowded every time I ve dined there. I d check out the Googles and see when the uncrowded sweet spot is if you don t want to wait for a table.  And I almost forgot - El Dorado is pretty kid-friendly. In the waiting area up front  they have some books  amp  toys for the kiddoes and my picky eater thought the quesadillas were great.
Eldorado Cafe,213,Great food  For some reason Yelp wants me to write more before it will post so I ll repeat myself  great food 
Eldorado Cafe,214,We love Eldorado Cafe and couldn t be happier that they re right down the street. The service  amp  take out has continued to be fantastic during COVID. They re keeping our family sane while we get through all this together
Eldorado Cafe,215,Doesn t get better. The nachos with beef picadillo are so delicious that-- even though we know we should try other things-- my husband and I both order them every time. The owner is a great guy and the service is good. Salsa X is the best.
Eldorado Cafe,216,The service was exceptional.  The chips  guac and taco were really good.  Nice atmosphere.
Eldorado Cafe,217,I really wanted to try the  supa queso  and love y all. It looked delicious from everyone s pics and the rave reviews online. We came in on a Wednesday evening and the host let us know that they were booked out for the evening  but luckily he offered us take out  After checking out the menu for a few minutes  we were ready to make our order  but waited for a different employee who was on the phone. Then the original guy walked up and completely ignored us after looking RIGHT at us  without saying a word  and then another employee walked up and looked at us without saying a word  and then another... Eventually they were just having a pow-wow and ignoring us all together behind the counter  We tried to flag someone but every attempt was quite LITERALLY ignored. I m a hostess who has worked at several large and high-volume restaurants in Austin  places with 3  hour waits at brunch. I know they were trying to buy time on a super slammed night  but not even getting a  Sorry folks  I ll be with you in a few minutes  combined with watching the entire staff glance at us and refuse to acknowledge was really off putting... especially on a  busy  night. It was obvious they weren t that busy. Granted  we are two very short girls in their 20 s often mistaken for teenagers  who were in a room of middle aged folk... but still. I digress. I hate leaving bad reviews  but this left a bad taste in my mouth as someone who works in the restaurant industry herself. And I would want to know if I offended customers   
Eldorado Cafe,218,Great atmosphere  waited around 15 minutes on a Sunday morning. I loved my food  left food without a huge dent in the wallet. the chips and salsa were good  left me very full before my entree came out. they charge for extra salsa. Just a solid job  nothing wrong. solid meal for a solid price. the dinner lunch entree look a big more pricey than breakfast but as far has breakfast goes this place hits the spot 
Eldorado Cafe,219,Visiting from chicago with a friend who just moved to Austin. I will leave Austin with such a warm heart and full belly. Our dinner here was incredible. The food and drinks were out of this world but the friendliness of the owner and the fun and professional staff made us feel like we were family. I ve never felt so welcomed at a restaurant.   I had a watermelon margarita and sangria that were unique and delicious. We had the shiny ribs to start and I had the Carnitas Cubanos for entree. I will dream of those Carnitas. Super full we still had the chocolate mousse topped with horchata Creme. Yum    Next time I m back in Austin for work this will be my first stop 
Eldorado Cafe,220,So excited that we stumbled upon this restaurant. Will definitely be back  Delicious  authentic Mexican food with a unique flare. Everything we ordered was delicious. You have your choice of mild  medium  or spicy salsa and the medium had just the right kick. We also ordered the queso and were quite pleased  we finished the entire small  The restaurant just recently won a  queso off  and after trying it  I believe the title was deserved. I also love the choices of sides. There are many different vegetable and hash options as we as your more traditional rice and beans.  We ordered chalupas  enchiladas  and carnitas  and each plate hit the spot.
Eldorado Cafe,221,Took my mom here for lunch on her birthday after reading some fellow yelpers reviews.   This place is awesome from the moment you walk in. Love the colorful decor and friendly staff.   We asked our server about some items on the menu and she was very helpful in explaining and leading us to some excellent choices.   We started with the chips and salsa. They have 5 house made salsas to choose from. We went with the chileverde which was dead center on the list for heat. I liked the flavor but it could have been hotter. We also had the queso. Nice and creamy but I really think the star of this was the chips  Nice and crispy and the perfect thickness for dipping.   Next we tried the puzchkas. 4 golden fried dumplings that were filled with a yummy filling were a nice small plate option.   Mom had the chicken enchiladas verde with rice and beans. The plate was huge with 3 enchiladas. They were flavorful and the chicken was tender with plenty of sauce.   I ordered the mojo pollo with 2 sides  3 potato hash and the calabasas. Absolutely LOVED  everything on my plate  The mojo pollo is a marinated chicken fajita type dish. The chicken was moist and the flavor marries well with the bed of grilled onions and peppers it was served on. Went for the flour tortillas instead of corn. Nice choice. The potatoes were perfect and the spice  I think cumin  was subtle yet addictive. I love squash so the calabasas caught my eye from the beginning and they did not disappoint  So yummy.   We were so stuffed  The owner  Joel  was making his rounds ensuring everyone was happy. He is so personable. We found out that he and my mom share a birthday  Not only did they bring out a special dessert but he also gave her a t-shirt. So sweet   We managed to find a little room for the delicious dessert   I d recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique take on Mexican food with a good vibe 
Eldorado Cafe,222,Soooo  we roll into Austin with the rain and of course do what one does when first entering Austin. . . . eat.  Our friends take us to Eldorado Cafe  they mention something about Joel from Taco D_l_ and don t have to say anymore. We re in.  We walk in and immediately get the Austin vibe and are greeted by super friendly staff. As I walk to the table I can t help but look at all the plates of food on the tables as we walk by  it looks incredible.  We take our seats and the waitress come over  does her thing and we order a ton of food  just can t help it as it all sounds so good on paper. The drinks arrive from the bar  they are spot on. Not some watered down kids beverage but a very good balanced drink.  The food then starts to show up  it looks great. We all dig in and I am telling you this stuff is fantastic. From the guacamole to the Shiny Ribs to the Puzchkas. Everything is just dead on.  So  the short story is this place is run great  the staff is great  the food is great the atmosphere is great. Yes Joel greats everyone and makes you feel right at home. So swing by  order one of everything as you won t retr it. And yes Joel  please open a location in Houston  and the Heights would be perfect.                           So we went back for breakfast  yep it s well worth it. Everything and I mean everything was fantastic. Customer service update for you  as if it could improve  we made mention of the cinnamon rolls they used to serve and I guess removed from the menu. Well next thing you know Joel is bringing a plate of  Hungry Jacks  to the table. That s right  he went to the kitchen and whipped up something for his customer just because. So if that does not scream customer service I don t know what does.   Again an awesome place where you feel right at home. Put those  Hungry Jacks  on the menu Joel  oh please . . . .
Eldorado Cafe,223,A friend and I tried Eldorado Cafe last week and had a decent meal  with pretty good service. The place was absolutely slammed - we picked a heck of a night to try them. They had a surprise party of 22  then several other bigger parties. While those parties were finishing up when we got there  it was still a 30-45 minute wait. We decided to wait  along with several other people  and were seated in about 30. We spoke with one of the hostesses waitresses and she was really  nice..very personable and friendly.  Their space is really nice - with a mix of tables and chairs  and a decent sized waiting area inside. It is nicely decorated and has a comfortable atmosphere - and I believe I saw some big lounge type chairs in back which is pretty cool.   Once seated  our waitress was generally pretty great - although we waited quite a while for our Eldorado queso  and really didn t get enough time to enjoy it before our meals came. While we were happy to get our meals quickly  as we had been waiting a half hour to be seated  queso time is important  too. The queso and chips themselves  however  were above average  we really liked them. Their house salsa was also fantastic.  On to the food - I ordered the Carnitas Cubanos. The pork was really good - think hashbrown style... crispy grilled on both sides. While the flavor was there  this dish was in desperate need of a sauce or some cheese. Even with stellar beans and rice  it was dry and lacking. My friend ordered the Hongos and seemed fairly pleased with her meal. We topped it off with splitting the generously portioned skillet cherry pie - which was amazing.  I m giving three stars   read as 3.5  for a pretty good first experience with room for improvement. I ll definitely be coming back again and I m sure they ll improve. Thanks 
Eldorado Cafe,224,Excellent food and friendly staff...usually busy no matter when you go...always a good sign.
Eldorado Cafe,225,This place is delicious. I ve lived down the street for 2 years and only recently discovered them. The Shaunna-Wanna Taco Salad with chicken and sesame dressing is absolutely amazing. The chicken is so flavorful and perfectly cooked.   I also tried the Suizas enchiladas with Mojo Veg and nearly cried at how good it was from the first bite. I wanted to stop eating 3 4 of the way cause I started teetering on the edge of uncomfortable full but it tasted so fricken good I finished my whole plate. I was absolutely stuffed with joy   Seriously how they season their food is out of this world. I ve been getting to-go since covid and I haven t been disappointed once with the quality of their food or their covid precautions.
Eldorado Cafe,226,From the drinks  to the salsas  hellloooo Salsa X    to the entrees  to the donuts.  Hands down my favorite place to pick up food when I m in the area.  Hell - I ve been known to drive from SW Austin for their food.  I literally  dream  about their carnitas Cubanos and las calabasas.  Joel s Happy Plate - Oh. So. Amazing. Also - I put salsa X on everything at home.  It s a staple.  Just go pick up something. Anything. You ll be glad you did.
Eldorado Cafe,227,We drive pretty far out of our way to come here every Saturday because their food is so good. Never had a bad dish  but after I found the Lucy s Short Rib Machacado I ll never order anything else.   Literally everything on the plate has flavor infused into it. The beans are sprinkled with green onions  the potatoes are saut ed with onions and bells peppers  and their sauces are too notch  try them all .
Eldorado Cafe,228,I ve been wanting to try this place ever since it opened.  A friend invited me to lunch so that was the opportunity.  I had enchiladas suizas with vegetables instead of rice.  I thought it was very  very good  and large portions as well.  I gave only three stars because our server wasn t friendly  and at one point seemed to be trying to get us to hurry up.  We had just finished eating when this occurred.  I want to return because the entree was so good  so am hoping for friendlier service.
Eldorado Cafe,229,Finally the skies opened up and dropped Eldorado Cafe into our  hood  An angel must have heard our cries for some delicious Mexican comfort food nearby. We had tried their tasty food at Dia s Market when they had Friday Pop-Ups and loved everything. Now  we have a full menu to select from for Breakfast  Lunch and Dinner. And a wonderful bar   I stopped by for a quick bite after my workout so I could justify the large basket of chips. These are not just any chip but chips made perfectly in the kitchen using the owner s recipe. Crunchy and flavorful with five salsas  people. Five  Each one delicious and flavorful. Do try this bargain at  5.95. And I might as well admit it  I m in love with the Salsa X  I could drink this stuff and use it as shampoo.  My lunch of three sides  Seasoned Black Beans  3 Potato Hash and Las Calabasas  was more than filling. I have a second lunch for tomorrow. Olivia  my server  was so sweet and informative as was Jessie  the GM. I am looking forward to seeing them both again  and many more tasty and delicious meals at Eldorado Cafe with family and friends. They do have a pup friendly outdoor area with a few tables.
Eldorado Cafe,230,Went here with a friend for brunch and it was meh. I had read the other reviews and knew about the charge for additional salsas and wasn t surprised when the server mentioned it and my friend I decided to pay for an extra salsa and got their smokey one and a milk green one. When the salsas arrive  I was surprised at the small size you get and also looking over at the table next to us  they had containers twice the size of ours and they were also a group of 2...I m not sure if there is large size you can order or if we were just unlucky. Moving on to the food  I got my usualy brunch dish  migas which came with bean and a potato hash. I found both the migas and the has to be bland and had to drown it in the smokey salsa to add some flavor. I would come back for the salsa but not the migas.  Service was weird. At first  they kept rushing us to order  someone stopped by to check in every other minute to see if we were ready. We came in near the end of brunch rush and there was no wait when we came so I was confused as to why they seemed to be rushing to get us to order. The weird thing was when it came to pay it took forever so no idea what was happening but it meant more time to enjoy the salsa.   Overall  would I come back  maybe  if a friend wanted to check out this place but I would not get the migas again. There are many other places that do migas better and might stick to the breaskfast taco. BUT I do RECOMMEND their SMOKEYflavored salsa was amazing and I will be getting that if I go back.
Eldorado Cafe,231,Let s begin with the positives.  The decorum was very appealing  our server was very friendly and professional  and there was plenty of ice in the margarita  oh  and the chips were good.  The first chips and salsa are complimentary  and each additional is  2  okay  if that s you way to want it.  This is NOT a Tex-Mex restaurant and the pricing proves it.  At the suggestion of our server  we ordered the  X  or something like that as our complimentary salsa.  It didn t have a lot of flavor and really lacked a pop in the spice department.  I ordered the Enchiladas Clasica with beef and my wife the Enchiladas Suiza with chicken.  Pretty straightforward stuff right   We found the sauces very thick and dry.  There was kind of a crust on the sauce.  There was not a great deal of flavor to the Clasica sauce and not very spicy at all.  My wife s Suiza was thick  flavorless and the chicken was just dry and terrible.    Oh  the comment about plenty of ice in the margarita as a positive was a joke.  There was very little margarita in the margarita.
Eldorado Cafe,232,Hour wait 6pm on a Friday night  the place is rocking.   Shinyribs are excellent  Chinese ribs with an Austin twist.   Papas rellenas are kinda oversized tater tots stuffed with cheese. I m certainly not saying that s a bad thing.  Nachos are really individually loaded and the picadillo topping is the bomb.   Great variety of salsas. Though they were all very flavorful  I kept going back and forth between the mild avocado salsa and the dangerous el scorpio.   Some nice drafts and mixed drink options as well.   Hoping they quickly expand the space. It s deservedly popular  in a part of town that has been crying out for more places just like this.
Eldorado Cafe,233,Stopped for Sunday Brunch and was thrilled to find Eldorado lived up to its rating. The menu takes some Tex-Mex favorites and elevated them subtly and successfully. Being from San Antonio I m picky of my Tex-Mex food but Eldorado is on point. I tried three different tacos and all were delicious. You must try their carnitas as they are juicy and tender.  Our server was very friendly and gave us great recommendations.  Overall  the look and the vibe are relaxed and welcoming. Can t wait to come back.
Eldorado Cafe,234,Absolutely amazing food and amazing service  Our food took a little while to come out so the waitress gave us each  5 off our check   We re not from around here but I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants some good Tex Mex.
Eldorado Cafe,235,Came for dinner one night after having this restaurant bookmarked for quite some time.  All of the food we received was PHENOMENAL. They did forget my moms nachos but it ended up being a good thing  she never would have finished them .  ALL of the food was so flavorful and fresh - truly amazing and great prices too. I ll for sure be back 
Eldorado Cafe,236,Carnitas come out crispy. Add the picked onions and salsa for some good tacos. I also had the rice and beans. I would recommend the beans but nothing special about the rice.
Eldorado Cafe,237,We heard great things about Eldorado from friends who live in the area and then were able to grab breakfast one day.  Food was just perfect  I couldn t dream up anything tastier.  Everything else  service  ambiance  etc  was 5 stars as well.
Eldorado Cafe,238,I wish they allowed 10 Stars    This was by far the best dining experience my wife and I have had in years. The food was fantastic  atmosphere great  and our server  David was the best server ever   The owner  Joel came by to wish me a happy birthday and present me with a gift. My wife had the Rene s Awesome enchiladas which truly were AWESOME.  I had the Sirloin Tampiqueno and it was tender and very flavorful.  There are so many choices on the menu and we plan to be regulars here so I plan on trying everything. I saw one review where someone complained about too many veggies in the rice. SERIOUSLY     Get a life  The rice was fantastic    This is not a Maudie s Tex Mex restaurant but rather Mexican inspired food with unique recipes. I m not a margarita fan but I had TWO. It too was great  See you soon Joel and Joanna.
Eldorado Cafe,239,Loved the chips and salsa. My favorite would be their El Scorpion and their Salsa X  which we were told was their most popular . I d recommend getting the salsa sampler if you are a salsa fiend   I ordered the Freddie s plate for breakfast. It was great   My friend got the sopapilla cheesecake and it was delicious...I d recommend getting it with ice cream.
Eldorado Cafe,240,Waited an hour to even get a seat just for subpar food and service for dinner. Even middle management was rude. It is also the only Mexican restaurant I know of that charges for salsa. I brought friends and I was so embarrassed. Go to Fonda San Miguel or a taco truck or any other more authentic place. But I m used to real Mexican food and Tex mex from San Antonio  the border  El Paso  and Mexico  etc. I ve heard the brunch is good if not authentic. The service and food was so bad  I m not sure I m tempted to go back  but it seems like brunch may be better if you re interested.
Eldorado Cafe,241,We really enjoyed the lunch at Eldorado.  I had two crispy tacos  one beef  one chicken  and although a little small in size they were really tasty and the taco shell wasn t greasy like some Mexican restaurants.  I also ordered the black beans and rice on the side  which was really good also.  Their red sauce  medium hot  was delicious but not like a salsa  more like a creamy sauce.  Different than traditional salsa and it complimented the tacos nicely.  My partner got the Enchiladas Verdes with hongos  mushrooms   rice and beans.  I had a taste and definitly would order them but would go for beef or chicken  for my taste. All in all  a great experience and nice addition to the neighborhood.  I would have given 5 stars but I think the tacos could be a little bigger than what appears to be street taco size.
Eldorado Cafe,242,My wife and I have been to El Dorado Cafe multiple times now and my only complaint is how popular it is but I can understand why. The food is all excellent and the recipes are creative and unique. The owners are very hands on and it shows with the management. Training is thorough and the experience is thought out  minus the wait time - please consider a bat signal in the sky so those of us lucky enough to be nearby can come quickly .   Seriously though. We used El Dorado Cafe for an office event that we had them cater recently and I wasn t expecting much but was proved wrong again. It wasn t just a  drop off of the food and bail  experience. They actually set everything up in a thoughtful manner and the owner even came on site to oversee and double check things. This is a key differentiator and has high value to us. Our lunch for our employees felt like a managed catering event as a result of their little touches and the food was incredible. We will absolutely be using them again.
Eldorado Cafe,243,This place is nestled in a strip mall across from what used to be Satay.  It s not the easiest place to find or get to  but well worth it.  Staff seems to get along really well and it added a little levity to the environment.    This place is definitely an Austin take on Tex Mex with some great salsas to go with your chips.  Enchiladas are good  but my recommendation is to go for the guisadas.  The beef short ribs and the carnitas are both amazing.  You ll definitely not leave here feeling hungry 
Eldorado Cafe,244,Came across the hidden gem recently and the wait was 45 minutes on a Saturday midday. I new  that was a good sign  so we got some chips and their incredible salsa selection and endured the wait  we were starving . During our wait a very friendly man came over and Introduced himself and later discovered that he was the owner of the restaurant. Joel was was unbelievably friendly and engaged us for at least 15 minutes. Everything we ordered was incredibly delicious and the server  was very hospitable. We will  definitely be back 
Eldorado Cafe,245,I found this place through Yelp and the rating was right  it was really good   We got the tacos and enchiladas covered with their queso.  For dessert we got the cherry skillet pie which was good  although  I would not order again  but the cheesecake was soooo good and unique.  Our server was great  a younger guy super friendly   Great prices and quality ingredients.  We will add this place to our rotation  
Eldorado Cafe,246,Had the best date night here    From the amazing  just my style  skinny margaritas to the great conversation with Joel the owner...epic dinner   We got to sample the ribs and the goat cheese nuggets...the salsa X flavor was my favorite with chips. Had the Hawaiian pork tacos and her tostadas looked amazing. Great night and I ll definitely go back again 
Eldorado Cafe,247,So we was in the area   taking care of daily life business   and decided to stop here to get something to eat.  This food was amazing   I love   love the Beef Quesadilla with the avocado on the side   the best   I didn t have to add any salt . Lol  overall I will come again when am on this side of town   am Located in Manor tx    shadowglen  ..  Everyone was Nice and inviting . Love the Margarita as well  .
Eldorado Cafe,248,My new favorite when visiting Austin.  A casual  neighborhood eatery that really knocks it out of the park every single time     Some of my favorites   - Freddie s Plate - the picadillo is super flavorful  Also  all of their breakfast plates come with 3 Potato Hash which I LOVE  LOVE  LOVE - Rene s Awesome Enchiladas - they are  indeed  AWESOME  The beef short rib is so tender and flavorful and it is COVERED is Cheese that makes this cheese lover weep  Also  one of the best margaritas I ve ever had.
Eldorado Cafe,249,I love this place i really do the food is sooooooo good it reminds me a little in genera of magnolia cafe but done from a Michelin star chefs point of view it is a small location and i do wish they would take reservations for large partys but so damn good
Eldorado Cafe,250,Was thinking about it all week and convinced hubs to go for lunch. Tried something new  the short rib salpicon. It is AHmazing. Comes with tortillas  pickled veggies  and you choose two sides.  Get  the mojo veggies   So much flavor. I am stuffed but still thinking fondly about it. Having a feeling Eldolrado can do no wrong...
Eldorado Cafe,251,I ate lunch at Eldorado Cafe this week. Was very impressed by the quality and taste of the food. They have 4-5 different designer salsas you can have with your chips. I chose the  Salsa X.  It is some of the best mild smokey tasting salsa I have had. I highly recommend it.   I had cheese enchiladas as my main course. They were outstanding as was the rice and beans.  I wanted to but didn t try their cherry dessert made in a cast iron skillet.   I will be back.
Eldorado Cafe,252,I like the variety of salsas you can choose from. And they make a pretty mean vegan enchilada 
Eldorado Cafe,253,This place is great  Probably one of the better Tex-Mex restaurants we ve been to in Austin. I always get the Uchinhon bowl and my wife loves the Carnitas Cubanos 
Eldorado Cafe,254,Get the salsa sampler  I usually am a cheese or enchilada gal but their mushroom  hongos  are the best  I have yet to try their desserts. Th way have an extensive menu. If it is your first time  you have to try the cheesy rice. Yum  
Eldorado Cafe,255,Eldorado Cafe is easily our favorite Mexican spot in Austin. Joel and team have built a low-key  convenient  and affordable restaurant with ridiculously high-quality food and service  as evidenced by lines out the door most evenings and weekends.  But please don t let a line or short wait deter you from grubbing down on some of the best carnitas and enchiladas - not to mention scratch-made salsas and a kick ass spicy margarita - we ve ever experienced  instead  grab a couple of  ritas at the bar  chips and salsa X  trust me  from any one of the friendly wait-staff  maybe the super queso if the mood strikes you  though don t spoil your appetite   and wait it out in style...  And when your name is called  get ready to tuck into some truly fantastic food. Whether it s your first or fortieth visit  expect a stop-by  quick chat  often in between hearty forkfuls of chow   and a handshake from Joel.  El Dorado Cafe has been a favorite since we moved to the area from the East Side about 1.5 years ago. We have taken out-of-town guests and even hosted an unofficial dinner here before our wedding. We relied on takeout while my wife was pregnant and picked up to-go our first night getting home from the hospital after our son was born  especially as my wife needed that spicy margarita  The restaurant and staff have become almost like extended family  going as far as hooking us up with an appetizer or two when the wait was longer than expected and we were 6 months pregnant.  Our favorite dishes  Carnitas Cubanos  add a fried egg  all sides are great   El Cabo salad  super queso  shiny ribs.  Bottom line  Go here and enjoy  Thanks for all you do Team El Dorado Cafe and see you again real soon   
Eldorado Cafe,256,Just ate the La Bomba. It was heaven in an open faced biscuit.  Couldn t have loved it more.  Every time I ve eaten their food  I have craved it even more the next time.
Eldorado Cafe,257,Big fan of the food  staff and neighborhood vibe.  HOWEVER  last night we ordered takeout  including a to-go Margarita.  Got home  ate food  husband drinks half his  15 Margarita.  I ask him how it is.  The Margarita was ONLY mix.  He was so disappointed.   He called the restaurant this morning to let them know about the experience.  El Dorado apologized  said it was a mistake on the website and they would remove it from the website. There was no offer of making it right.  No offer of a refund for the  15 fancy lime-ade.  And no offer of a Margarita on the house when we order next time. I am still a fan   The food is too good.  But that Marg and the way the situation was handled has left a bad taste in my mouth. I d like to think my husband just talked to the wrong person...someone who did not seem to care about a regular customer s experience.
Eldorado Cafe,258,My husband and I LOVE this place  The food is not traditional Tex Mex. It is fresh and has a lot more to offer than your run of the mill Mexican place in Austin. Make sure you order the Salsa X. It s addictive  If you are a first timer make sure you get the salsa sampler. Another great appetizer choice is the Papas Rellenas.  The classic house queso is awesome and it s not your typical Velveeta mess. My husband is a vegetarian and their menu is full of items he loves. We have pretty much tried it all and loved it all. My favorite is the Enchiladas Suizas with the chicken tinga . The creamy salsa verde is delicious. The Shaunna-Wanna Taco Salad is really good and comes in a meat or meatless version. If I m not super hungry and looking for something light I go for the T House  3 Combo Chalupa. It s soooo good  For sides you will want to try the CheeznRice  and the Las Calabasas- a delicious mix of butternut squash  zucchini and roasted garlic.  The owner  Joel is always front and center and always stops by to say he is happy to see us again. The servers are all awesome  It s definitely the type of place you feel at home in. The happy hour drinks are great too  Margaritas and my favorite Sangria. Yum  Warning- this place is always busy. A wait time is just part of the magic that isn t so magical. I promise it is worth the wait  Order a drink and munch on some chips and salsa while you wait on a table. If you have a big party you should absolutely call ahead and let them know. I hope you enjoy Eldorado Cafe as much as we do.
Eldorado Cafe,259,I don t understand why this place is so popular. The sauces are  good  but not great. The rest of the food is mediocre at best. I tried this place three times to give it a fair shot. Meh. Even the margaritas are sub-par  heavy on booze  light on flavor. The atmosphere is nice.
Eldorado Cafe,260,I ordered an Enchilada plate to go. The staff was super sweet and the place was very lively. My food was pretty good for the most part but the part that dissatisfied me was that the chicken wasn t seasoned. My rice was great  the black beans were good  there was sauce for the enchiladas but it wasn t enough for the enchiladas as I d hoped. Perhaps I will order extra sauce next time.
Eldorado Cafe,261,We picked up dinner at El Dorado last night and it was delicious  We ordered the queso  El Guac tostados  las calabasas  and Joel s Happy Plate. The curbside delivery was great  I placed the order online and it gave me a precise time. We parked and followed the directions for texting. Our meal was quickly delivered and placed on a chair in front of the car by a masked employee. They walked off  we got our food. Terrifically touchless.  Update  On our order this past week  we added the  delicious pork casserole from their Take and Bake menu. Yummmy   
Eldorado Cafe,262,The best Huevos Rancheros I have ever had    Really nice staff and amazing food.   I will be back 
Eldorado Cafe,263,Love this place. You can get Mexican food with veggies  Great options for any dietary needs. Awesome drinks. Top-notch service. It can be busy with a significant wait at peak times.
Eldorado Cafe,264,This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. I have a serious problem with the salsa X because I could literally eat it with a spoon. Every dish and side I ve tried there has been exceptional. The only downside is that there s always a wait because it s so good. They should really take the empty space next door and just double in size  but there would probably still be a wait.  Austin has a number of really good Mexican restaurants that would be exceptional in other cities. This place is exceptional for Austin.
Eldorado Cafe,265,So I came to place at noon on a Wednesday and this place was packed. The energy was great and everyone was having a good time. The host sat me down with a menu right away and the bartender was friendly and helpful  despite still being busy and taking to go orders. The food was amazing and tasteful. Can t wait to come back with my wife who s the foodie next time.
Eldorado Cafe,266,This place is popular. I was promptly seated on Tuesday at 8 45  but any other time expect a wait. Coming in  it strikes one that this place does not look like most other Mexican restaurants. And that s even before you consider the well-stocked bar with local booze. So  eh  what s a Mexican place like in a very white neighborhood of Central Austin  Well  the serving personnel was all very white with plenty of tattoos. That makes this hipster-Mexican   The menu had plenty of items but somehow it didn t make an impression of a lot of variety. Many beef and chicken dishes  no fish. But next time I m going to check out the Honchos  Mexican mushrooms. That ll be new to me.  Apart from a waitress who overlooked us  service was all fine. Chips are served automatically  but there is a choice of salsa  so that takes an extra trip to the kitchen before you re snacking. Our medium salsa had an interesting taste  nothing like the traditional salsa.  My Enchiladas Suizas were very tasty. I m pretty sure  creamy salsa verde  is not a traditional dish but it was good all the same. My dinner companion was less enthousiastic about her choice  which seemed more middle of the road. My rice had some pickled vegetables mixed in  which I liked  the contrast of tastes  textures  temperatures.  Despite these noted incidences of creativity  this place is nowhere near the upscale Mexican places such as Fonda San Miguel. Conclusion  medium-priced moderately creative Mexican. I may go back  but not too soon.
Eldorado Cafe,267,I wanna love this place. We wanted to return for dinner after an awesome lunch a couple weeks back. I am willing to pay the price for non-Sysco food and I am willing to wait to be seated - and coming from me  that s saying a lot  We arrived at 5 30 pm  there was a  30 to 35 minute  wait for a party of four. When we signed in with the hostess  we saw there was an 8-top and a handful of 2-tops ahead of us. We checked in regularly as we walked our kids around during the wait to make sure we didn t miss being called. Almost an hour later  we gave up  and wondered why and how a party of 4 was seated ahead of us  given the list we d seen when we began our wait. Sigh.   Before we started The Great Wait  I did look to see if it was possible to join the list online before we left home  I did not see this option  and the hostess never mentioned it. If you ve got an hour to spare  by all means  try this place. It s good. I just don t usually have an hour to spare  so I don t think I ll be back much.          Run  don t walk. I have a new favorite restaurant  and this is it. I have to admit  I was encouraged to visit the Eldorado Cafe based on raving reviews from vegetarians  when can a vegetarian ever get notable Mexican  Today we had our first visit  and the carnitas is better than homemade  as are the cocktails. It s not often I find a restaurant that makes food better than me  but here we are. Based on this near-religious experience with the carnitas  I may never order vegetarian here. It was  indeed   crispy carnitas.  The side dishes  black beans and the calabzas  were also exceptional  as were the cocktails and the service. The notes on the menu make it clear they are there to be around for the long haul  not just the Next Big Thing. Children are welcome  and I m sure my kids would dig the kids menu. But what really knocked it out of the park was the soundtrack  was it DJed by Rick McNulty   and the framed LPs on the wall - Sergio Mendes and Herb Alpert - JUST LIKE HOME.   Five stars  two thumbs up  and all the love. Thank you  Eldorado Cafe. You are really forcing me to consider moving up toward Shoal Creek. We shall return  and not a moment too soon.
Eldorado Cafe,268,Absolutely incredible place  They do contactless curbside which is really amazing during these covid times. The food is always really delicious and hits the spot. Love ordering from here.
Eldorado Cafe,269,Imaginative menu. Excellent service. I ve eaten here twice and it s more than met expectations
Eldorado Cafe,270,The choices will make you dizzy due to everything sounding amazing  Be sure to try anything that has short rib in it  because it is life changing. I m getting the shiny ribs next time  They went past me and I shed a single tear.
Eldorado Cafe,271,First time here. My friends always rave about the place so..Was seated immediately after 4p on a Saturday. Wait staff was friendly and the salsa x was so so good.  Ordered the enchiladas suizas and ate ALL of it  despite my very full belly. Will def be back 
Eldorado Cafe,272,Let me say I am a regular and a happy one at that  I love love love the food here. Moreover  I love that their vegetarian options are fantastic and wonderful for all  I always start with a watermelon Margarita with chili salt and grilled panela cheese   I love the hongos in many ways and styles   It is busy  which is great  but sometimes hard to get in to  However  it is worth the wait. As it is so very lovely and tasty 
Eldorado Cafe,273,We were so excited to find this place when we saw that Cabo Bob s across the street was closed on a Sunday and this place had 200  review s with 4.5 stars wow maybe we would never go across the street to Bob s again   No so fast  The wait was long so we ordered to go  which would be faster theoretically we were advised   after waiting for 30  mins we decided to get a table after all  once we were finally seated the server NEVER came to our table after delivering the order  I mean not even once  not even to refill our water glasses  Maybe they thought because we ordered to go we wouldn t tip them - but we aren t that thoughtless we fully planned to tip  and we wanted to add to our order  Finally we just left after eating.  In terms of the food the soup was pretty good and the chalupa was decent  however the potato and bean tacos were totally flavorless and really felt blah. The chances of ever coming back here is pretty low.
Eldorado Cafe,274,Absolutely love and adore this place  Not only are the managers and staff incredible  the food is also  I ordered the vegan taco and vegan enchilada- both amazing. Ordered breakfast tacos -AMAZING  This is a business I want to continue to support.
Eldorado Cafe,275,Easily one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. I m sure a lot of folks will describe the food in detail  I ll just say it s very good and go on to describe some other things.  - really good service. I got into a casual conversation standing in line at a food truck in South Austin and when the subject of Eldorado came up  they commented on the excellent management and wait staff. Turned out this person was in the food business herself and she knew about the owner and the staff he d hired. I believe it. The wait staff is outstanding.   - small but good bar. Again  service at the bar was excellent while we waited for our table. Pineapple Margaritas were excellent and strong and cheerfully and quickly served.   - waiting area is outside the front door. They provide tables and chairs and have a self-service water station to keep you cool in the Austin heat.   - excellent hot sauces. If you re a sauce person  they have 5 different ones they can bring out with your chips.   - they are doing good business. Be prepared to get there early or wait a while. We only had to wait 45 minutes at 7pm on a Saturday night - which really isn t bad - but if you re not there early  you ll definitely be waiting a while.  It s worth it though.
Eldorado Cafe,276,Fantastic Food  Great Service  Everything we ordered was delicious  The sopapilla cheesecake is incredible  Will definitely be back 
Eldorado Cafe,277,D-effing-licious   The Nomad was excellent  the chilaquiles was excellent  the muffin was excellent    the music selection was excellent.
Eldorado Cafe,278,Went to this restaurant. Was told it would be a 15 min wait  was offered to sit at the bar  so I did. I wanted a beer anyways. Everyone else who was waiting got seated  except my party and I. We looked at the host and he did not acknowledge us. Everyone who came in was seated except my party  once again. I once again acknowledged the host and no answer. So I left. I m sure everyone is raving about the food  but I ll never know because I never had the chance to get seated.
Eldorado Cafe,279,Delicious enchiladas  Can t wait to come back to try breakfast as that menu looked more up my alley  but lunch was pretty dang good. Expect a little bit of a wait even on a weekday.
Eldorado Cafe,280,Delicious food  We waited for about 40 mins on a busy Sunday. Of course we went during the brunch rush but since we were just visiting and other restaurants had longer waits we gave this one a shot. We were really happy with our decision. The food was piping hot  And so delicious. Everything tasted homemade in the best possible way. My bf ordered the enchiladas souizas and I ordered the Huevos Texicanos without jalape o. His dish came with rice and after trying it I immediately had to get my own side order. I also had two different kinds of mimosas that were just okay. The grapefruit mimosa tasted like the way chapstick smells but I drank it. A mimosa is a mimosa lol. The pineapple one was a lot better.  All in all  if I m ever back in Austin I would definitely visit this place again 
Eldorado Cafe,281,The menu has some unique options I wasn t expecting but was really happy to taste. I love the potato cakes and their salsas are all delicious. I also had the quesadilla  rajas con queso  and it was a perfection of flavor and just the right amount of crisp. So Freaking Good. What a great place.
Eldorado Cafe,282,Enchiladas Suiza. Yum. Yum. Yum.  If there s one thing this restaurant s menu is not  is boring. There are so many awesome  innovative twists on otherwise staple items. For instance  the Chi Chi Tinga  Tender Chicken Breast in a Red Chile Adobo Sauce  however their more standard dishes are always a winner  too  and what they may lack in innovation  they certainly make up for in taste and quality. The Enchiladas Suizas  Creamy Salsa Verde  Avocado   amp  Jack Cheese with Your Choice of Filling  Beef   Chicken   Cheese   Hongos  had an incredible flavor profile and that sauce was no joke.   If anything  you should go for the salsa sampler and margaritas. It s the perfect combo for those chips-and-salsa-with-a-margarita days  and those margs...let s just say they weren t weak  which made for an exceptionally lovely Friday dinner with kids. Oh  did I mention there was a kid area for them to semi-run free  Yup. Right by the front entrance where you wait for your table. It made for waiting on a Friday with a toddler much more bearable. That and the margarita.  I am already thinking about my next visit  and the Carnitas Cubanos   Crispy Pork Roasted in a Cuban Style Citrus Garlic Mojo is looking pretty  pretty good  in the Larry David kind of way .
Eldorado Cafe,283,For real  this restaurant is delish  I came the first time with my parents in December  mainly out of curiosity to see how they changed the inside from Alborz  sidenote  I m still mourning Alborz   and it was hopping at 3 pm on a Sunday  Let me just take a second to rave about the salsa  the El Scorpio is so delicious - if you read my other reviews  I reference the Dona sauce from Taco D and this definitely rivals it. I think the owner  Joel  used to be a chef for Taco D  I don t know  I could have my facts wrong  but either way  the El Scorpio sauce is divine. Mix it in with that queso... mmmm  mmm  good.   I got the chicken enchiladas both of the times I ve come and lemme tell ya  so good  not greasy like some other places can make it. The rice is nice and light and the refried black beans are delicious. My parents have gone and said that the quesadillas are good and my mom lately has been on the tostada kick. They ve also gotten the short ribs  lemon garlic chicken  carnitas cubanos  and the enchiladas suizas and have said all are good. It s a little pricier than some other restaurants   13 for the enchilada plate - FYI  there s not a separate lunch menu   but the ingredients are fresh and you don t feel heavy after eating nor do you smell greasy when leaving. Also  I ve left with half of my food leftover both times I ve gone.   Eldorado is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood  It has a nice  friendly vibe and the waitstaff is also generally very helpful and friendly  Probably come expecting to wait for a table  especially if you come with a larger group  but that s pretty much everywhere in Austin these days.
Eldorado Cafe,284,Great change of pace from standard Tex-Mex.  Still full of classics but all with a fresher modern feel.  Tasty brunch.  Good drinks.  Helpful friendly service.  And eighties hits playing in the background.
Eldorado Cafe,285,We stopped by here while up north after a quick Yelp search for Mexican food. I have been on a quest to find good Tex-Mex Mexican in Austin and find most places just  okay.  Despite our names vanishing from the wait list  we waited less than the quoted time  received free queso  had excellent service  and super tasty dinner  The house and sangria margaritas were very good  and the suiza chicken enchiladas were  also quite tasty. We were excited to try the Papas Rellenas having never had them before. Really good   Had a great time and will definitely be back 
Eldorado Cafe,286,This place was great  Good service  unique concept of offering different types of salsas with your chips  and the food was really different than your standard Tex Mex and very tasty. We would totally eat here again 
Eldorado Cafe,287,Amazing place  staff and atmosphere. My friend and I ordered the classic enchiladas but didn t like it very much. Before we could even say anything  the owner asked how our food was and quickly offered to replace it with something else. The server and bartender are amazing. Very vibrant local spot with plenty of parking. Support your local restaurants.
Eldorado Cafe,288,If you aren t coming here for the chilaquiles rojas every weekend  then you re messing up  The carnitas here are absolutely incredible  And that X salsa though  Dayummm is all I can say  I think I ve come just about every weekend for the last 2 months and I m still not sick of it.
Eldorado Cafe,289,They have a beverage that mixes horchata with cold brew coffee  and it s a definite must-order. My friend had the Chilaquiles Rojas and I had the Nomad plate. Both were excellent. She said the coffee was strong and on point. We split a biscuit with jam. The biscuits are quite large and excellent. Great service  great atmosphere  and great food.
Eldorado Cafe,290,Came here for the 1st time for lunch and it was good. Nothing that I can say was  spectacular   but it was a nice experience. Staff was friendly and accommodating for me and my son. Food was pretty good. Quesadillas were good  but could ve been better if they served Ranch dressing. Yes  they do serve salads  but no Ranch.  bummer  My son liked the black beans. All around decent spot for a bite to eat.
Eldorado Cafe,291,Amazing. Authentic. Delicious. Honestly some of the best Mexican food you can find in Austin  As a Hispanic  I grew up eating the good stuff  and Eldorado has it. My whole family loves this place. Yes it leans TexMex  but like amazingly well done.  Wish you could make reservations for parties smaller than 6  
Eldorado Cafe,292,I love it.  Lately  I ve been loving less the overly-greasy  processed cheese Tex-Mex that Austin loves  but don t worry  this is just temporary ... I will get down on some Amaya s any day of the week  . Eldorado is the PERFECT solution to this for a few reasons.   First  their menu has something for everyone  including breakfast   but nothing is your plain  ole version that you might expect. For example  instead of all dishes coming with  basic rice and beans  you get to choose from a list of  7 sides  Everything we ve tried so far during three visits has been excellent.   Second  their queso and salsas are good - AND THIS IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO GET ITS OWN LINE  Because  Texas.   Third  their drinks are good   Fourth  the vibe is really nice. Super chill  great for families  but prob not a good choice if you re looking for somewhere fancy.
Eldorado Cafe,293,It s Mexican food for white people with disposable income. I paid fourteen bucks for a plate with two small cheese enchiladas  some refried black beans  and white rice with stuff mixed into it. Oh  and a sprinkle of escaveche as garnish  which incidentally was the most impressive part of the dish.  I live in a major city 200 miles from Mexico. I can do much better for half the price.   PS. The staff were all friendly and very helpful.
Eldorado Cafe,294,3.75 stars Lemon chicken was tasty. Staff were very nice.  I don t know what the fuck was up with the delicious sounding tres leches peach bread pudding. Didn t eat 1 2.  Queso was like water and the chips were almost stale.  I will go back and skip the queso and try a different dessert. However  I m not sure it s worth waiting over 30 mins. It s not THAT special.
Eldorado Cafe,295,Chef Joel Fried has a wide repetoire of super creative and flawlessly executed dishes. We only tried a few items today and my favorites were pretty much all of them  papasrellenas  cheeznrice  chipsandsalsa  flautas  tacos If you are a chili head  you must try the elscorpio salsa.  The Papas Rellenas  potato and cheese cakes  are  a bite of heaven. Paired with the SalsaX they have the right amount of heat and they literally melt in your mouth  It s my new favorite place and not to mention the stellar hospitality from every staff member. Can t wait to go back again for more.   There is plenty of parking and the ambience is super fun. Best mexican food in Austin.
Eldorado Cafe,296,You must try this place  A friend told us about his  fave  Mexican cafe and that we had to try it. We are so glad we did  this has become a date night regular.   The cubanos carnitas is amazing  We go for the veggie sides that are incredible and make it slightly healthier.   Try all the salsas  they are all uniquely amazing.   The vibe is fun  the service is awesome  and the owners are cool. They even whipped up some custom concoctions when we asked if there was something not on the menu. Free of charge to boot.   Now that s service 
Eldorado Cafe,297,Stopped in with the band after playing a show in Austin and was treated to an amazing meal by our friend Joey at this exceptional restaurant. Excellent food and service. From the michelada to homemade salsas to slow cooked meats  all prepared with loving care. As an added bonus the owner Joel  who himself was a touring musician  threw us some tshirts and the ever needed socks for the road. An welcoming oasis on our journey and highly recommended to locals and travelers alike. We ll be back and so should you.
Eldorado Cafe,298,Good food  great people  what more could ask for  Tried the Nomad for breakfast- delectable. If you come for dinner  look no further than the salsa sampler and the carnitas cubanas... don t tell your friends.   
Eldorado Cafe,299,We went to Eldorado Cafe tonight for the soft opening and it is going to be our new favorite neighborhood restaurant   We have been going to the pop-ups that they had before they opened the brick and mortar and we are excited to see this open.    The restaurant has a warm  comfy vibe to it that we really enjoyed.   All of the staff are nice and welcoming and the service was very smooth.    We loved the freshly prepared food.  Tonight we had the Enchiladas Classica filled with cheese and they were yummy.   We have tried many items from their menu and they are all delicious.  I m a big fan of the T-house  3 Chalupa  too.   We ended the meal with a scrumptious skillet cherry pie.   They also offer a full bar and we had the watermelon margarita- very smooth.   The owners are very warm and genuine people and you can tell that they love what they are doing.    The official opening date is August 8th  so you can go check it out for yourself 
Eldorado Cafe,300,Update   I ve had dinner here several times  I love the Enchiladas Suizas  Esme s Enchiladas  Tacos Salad with shredded chicken  chips with Salsa X  and the SHINY RIBS. Service is amazing and the owner is so nice. I m so happy Eldorado is walking distance from my place 
Eldorado Cafe,301,What El Dorado Cafe lacks in ambiance  they more than make up for in spirit. Yes it s in a strip mall next to an unfortunate place called Water for Wine. Yes  they have some awkwardly lit tables and an eclectic mix art and a slightly too child-friendly of a waiting area that offers a view of a Mattress Firm. Ignore all of this because the food  drinks and service at El Dorado is what you re living for. It s why you came to Austin 25 years ago  it s why you stayed. Their servers are moving fast  but not so fast that they don t take a minute to say hello and owner chef Joel might just pop over to your table and check on you as well. You can talk bout music or food with him  he s down for either. But really you re here for the food and drinks.  El D. has the perfect mix of fresh flavors with their own take on modern Tex Mex. They have plenty of meat and vegetarian options. Their pork green chile plate is outstanding. The Tamale house  3 Chalupa  tasty. Even the house salad is always fresh and on point. Salsa X and El Scorpio and a Paloma will set you straight.   Part of me wants to tell you to stay far away from El Dorado because I want to keep it my neighborhood secret  but I can t - the owners and staff are just too nice and I want them to succeed  The best of the best neighborhood Mexican restaurants I ve been to in a long time. Viva El Dorado 
Eldorado Cafe,302,Excellent find  Our first time to Eldorado Cafe but definitely not the last. We are from Las Cruces  NM and have been searching for great Mexican food. We found it.   We had the Tampiqueno sirloin special and Rene s special enchiladas. Both were outstanding. Joel and the staff made us feel welcomed and at home.
Eldorado Cafe,303,This place is my new favorite restaurant in Austin.  Having grown up in the RGV  I set the bar pretty high for Mexican   Tex-Mex comfort food and El Dorado passes that.  I ordered the carne guisada special they had going and it is abuelita level good.  Everything about our meal was excellent.  Service and staff are awesome too.  I ll be back for sure.
Eldorado Cafe,304,I really love this place their cases the best their service is good it s small very home feeling and their Margaritas are the best in Austin
Eldorado Cafe,305,Going for review 100   I love Eldorado Cafe and that it s walking  or that one time  stumbling  after a few margaritas  distance from home. The only downside is  I m not the only person who loves them  so there s often a wait. We have sat at the bar frequently as a result and adore the bartenders.   Crispy beef tacos are THE BEST crispy beef tacos I ve had  and I ve had a lot of them. They make the shells in house and the ingredients are all fresh.   Only Mexican joint where I ll willingly order a side salad.   Shiny ribs - chomp   T-house chalupa is da bomb   Great drinks   Great owners 
Eldorado Cafe,306,Our fav tex mex restaurant in ATX. We ordered enchiladas and some Migas. Fresh. Flavorful  One piece of advice. Get the scorpion sauce. It s life changing spicy
Eldorado Cafe,307,This is actually a decent breakfast place located in a mini-mall. It s kind of hidden from view. So make sure you pay attention or just listen to what the GPS tells you. I ordered a taco but not necessarily a taco. You can actually order it as a bowl and make your own taco. I ordered a taco bowl with avocado  eggs  black beans and potatoes which turned out good. The coffee is decent. So if you are looking for a variety of breakfast places  go ahead and put Eldorado Caf  as one of them.
Eldorado Cafe,308,El Dorado Cafe is a staple in our  going out rotation . I love the Sandinista cocktail  watermellon and ginger . I also love that they have some amazing vegan and vegetarian options on the menue. The house salad with the sesame arbol dressing simple and always perfect. I sometimes pair that with some black beans and mojo veggies for a light meal. Some places offer veggie options  but you can tell their heart s not in it. Not this place. They mean it.
Eldorado Cafe,309,The Inside   The inside of the restaurant was very cute and spunky  lots of good pictures   etc on the walls  I like the colors they picked for the restaurant  The Server   the server was very nice and the service was very nice - very good  The Food    my dad ordered the Migas  He liked his  it is interesting they have queso sauce on the migas  the Potatoes was very good  I Had the Huevos Rancharos  which was very good  it was interesting as well that it has avacados  on it. it was very good as well  On a side note  2 Things we had a coupons for  5 off  it had no expiration  i think it should have a expiration date to see how effective it is especially since they are trying to promote  advertise the restaurant  and it should also say 1 per visit to get repeat customers which we are planning to come back  Second if you sell shirts  the restaurant staff should comment on the customers wearing their shirts  which I wore my Eldorado Cafe shirt and nobody commented on it   but either then that the experience was very good
Eldorado Cafe,310,I ve been searching Austin for years for a Mexican restaurant to match my old out-of-state haunts  chains like Chuy s are blah to me  and even Fonda San Miguel was a bit of a let down after the hype . Eldorado Cafe is the place that finally nailed it for me   Executive Chef Joel Fried  the man largely responsible for TacoDeli s award winning salsas   graciously blessed North Austin with what is certainly my new favorite Mexican restaurant in the city   I tried  Joel s Happy Plate   which was a tasty mix of enchiladas topped with Red Chile Sauce  Eldorado Queso  amp  Jack cheese and a Jalape o Toreado. My co-worker got the Puzchkas  bacon-filled fried dumplings  and loved them  too   Come early for lunch as word is getting out about this place and it fills up quick  but either way it s worth the wait   We ll be back 
Eldorado Cafe,311,Tio White Potato  4.0  delicious but lost a point due to small portion  ordered another plate plus another egg to fill up.  All the over-easy eggs had a lot of uncooked egg white  20    completely transparent.  Note to self  La Bomba or Migas Plate next time
Eldorado Cafe,312,This place is amazing.. great food... great staff.  This place is so wonderful  we used them for catering.  They were so accommodating  they helped me figured out what works best for my event. Everything worked out perfect.  Catering manager Laura is lovely  and on point. I can t sing their praises any louder.
Eldorado Cafe,313,A down to earth no frills community Mexican caf . Yes   They serve breakfast through dinner every day  except Monday they are closed .  Came here recently for brunch. Waited 20 minutes and then was able to get a seat at the bar.  This was the lowest wait time since we have attempted to eat at this new spot.  Previously the wait times were over 45 minutes  and they don t take reservations. There is a cute little seating area available which is nice. While the space is not large  they have done a good job of creating an open seating environment that is cozy  artistic  love the diverse colors   and inviting.  This is a casual family friendly eating establishment.  The service was incredibly friendly and I felt immediately at home. They have an extensive menu of interesting items  even for breakfast.  My husband tried the Freddy s plate  and I tried the papas breakfast taco on corn.  I also had a side of fruit  and my husband snagged the last biscuit in the house as a side.  The breakfast taco was delicious.  The egg was cooked to perfection.  It is one of the best breakfast tacos I have had. The bacon was crisp and flavorful just like I like.  My husband s plate was flavorful and tasty as well.  The husband said the biscuit was good.  The fruit bowl was incredible  I have never seen such a heaping side of fruit.  It was fresh and delicious. My husband s Bloody Mary was OK and my Sandanista with fresh watermelon Aqua Fresca was sweet but refreshing.  The food is decently priced and tasty for brunch.  We will need to come back for lunch and dinner.
Eldorado Cafe,314,Salsas were great  chips were great  black bean tostadas were amazing. What I loved the most was the guy who brought the food out. Maybe a manager owner  not sure  but super friendly.   The only reason I took off a star was the young girl at counter who was trying to rush us out so the table could be used for the next party  came at 11 15 .
Eldorado Cafe,315,We had dinner at Eldorado for the first time on Tuesday night  they were slammed  and seemed completely unprepared for it . We opted to sit in the bar area where we were told that we would get full service  but everything took a while.  From there  things didn t get much better  the margarita one of us ordered was 85  ice cubes  another Yelper commented on this  so doesn t seem like much has been done about it  and didn t come out with the requested salt. We started with the supa queso  which was good but watery. Our dinner entrees were better--the enchiladas verde and one of the carnitas  guisos . The food tasted fresh and flavorful.  Our main issue with this place is value  otherwise we would have given it 4 stars. But  15 for an entree that is just plain fine but not extraordinary is ridiculous. Another pet peeve that seems to be the fashion these days is managers owners commenting on reviews with overeager  We ll work on that  Thank you so much for your feedback and it ll be better when you come back.  Obviously it s just not true  i.e. all the ice in the drinks  and it s just so stupid. If somebody doesn t have a good experience  or thinks that the value isn t there  He she will not be back  Unless you give do something to have a repeat customer  then kiss that business goodbye. Things might be busy now  but who knows how long that will last  we re not planning on going back.
Eldorado Cafe,316,We have been to Eldorado twice now and loved it both times    The food is delicious and ORIGINAL   It s not the tired old Telmex that it seems is all over Austin.  This is interesting  flavorful food prepared well at a great price.  These days it seems like you have to pay an arm and a leg to get innovative food  not here   For example - the last time we were there I got the mashed potato enchiladas   My family thought I was crazy but I thought  the food was great last time  I m just going to go out on a limb.  Delicious      How in the world do you make mashed potato enchiladas feel fresh and light       I don t know but they were      The chips are fantastic  queso is freakin  awesome  and I m only sad to say that we ve been too full to try dessert.   We will be back.  Again and again.  Keep doing what you re doing    
Eldorado Cafe,317,Possibly the best food I ve ever had. Great bartenders. Great service. Great margs. Great food. I will be bringing all my friend and family here.
Eldorado Cafe,318,Great new addition to the neighborhood. Great options including good vegan ones. Next time I m going to skip the salsa sampler and go straight for the Salsa X   The staff is great with lots of them stopping by the table constantly checking to make sure everything is great.
Eldorado Cafe,319,First visit.  They officially opened four days ago.  Tex-Mex breakfast acid test.  Solid take on classic migas.  Quality ingredients prepped  amp  seasoned with a skilled  steady hand.  The saut ed papas  peppers  carrots and black bean sides were a cut above other Tex mex breakfast places versions.  Coffee was okay but not mind blowing.  Feedback is either offer or include a small container of salsa with the migas.  Shouldn t have to ask for that with migas.  El Dorado outdid themselves with the redesign of the old Alborz Persian space in the NW corner of Anderson  amp  Shoal Creek just East of Mopac.  Great eye for detail in the space.  Mutant dolphin   Check.  Comfortable 4 top tables.  I ll ask to sit at one of those crescent booths  under that lysergic dolphin for the enchilada acid test  next time to get my people watching on.  Nice  on the ball server.  Food came out fast and hot.  Competitive pricing based on the quality of the ingredients and time put into cooking them just right.
Eldorado Cafe,320,This is a cool  authentic spot in north austin. It can feel a little soulless up here  w all the standard retail chain spots close by. Ambience was def refreshing.  Food and drinks were great portions and DELICIOUS  my family of mixed plant based and carnivore folks all had no complaints  . Dranks were poppin.  Also  a huge shoutout to the great staff. Super pleasant and went out of their way to check up on us and make sure everything was still great. S o to the manager  Christie  for being especially warm.
Eldorado Cafe,321,After discovering our previous choice only did Sunday brunch  we saw Eldorado s ratings. Crazy  because we ve driven by hundreds of times but neither of us had heard of it. So... we arrived  complete party  and the  badass  manager readily seated us for Sunday dinner. Our server Christina promptly greeted us with salsa recommendations  definitely do the flight  all very unique flavors    and took drink orders. The margaritas are spot-frkn-on deLISH  Espolon traditional  prickly pear and watermelon  all perfectly mixed. Per recommendation  I ordered the carnitas. Lemme tell you   I m accustomed to getting pork that looks pulled and belongs in a sandwich. Not this time--carnitas at Eldorado are crispy and insane tasty  Yes  I d agree  best in Austin  and many other cities I ve lived . Everyone else loves their entrees. The guacamole was so good  we ended getting two large bowls  Christina offered some tasty dessert options but we were stuffed. Next time  Eldorado is our new top go-to  and there s an awesome drinking fish on the wall. This place is hella badass
Eldorado Cafe,322,We really enjoyed our meal here  We had heard great things and finally had a chance to check it out. We came here on a Friday evening around 6 30 and the wait time was about 1 hour but we were probably seated within 25 minutes.   The restaurant is in a strip mall and they did a good job of transforming the space inside. There is a small seating area in the front where people can wait  the bar was packed and is off to the side and the rest of the space is for seating.   The menu has a plethora of items and it was hard narrowing down our options. You can pick one salsa for free and we ended up with the avocado salsa  which was a bit too sour for our preference.   We ended up ordering sharing  Sticky ribs  5 5   never thought of sticky ribs as a Tex mex dish  but this was so delightful  The rib meat was super tender and it was easy to eat with a fork and knife because the meat was falling off the bone.  Fried mashed potato dish with bacon forget the real name   5 5   my favorite item of the evening  This was like a fried ravioli stuffed with the most delicious mashed potatoes I ve ever eaten. This is a must  Pork carnitas  5 5   I like for the entrees you can choose between a variety of sides. The meat was tender and flavorful and the sides we got were tasty as well. There was literally nothing left on our plate.   Overall we love this place and will be back  There are still so many items on their menu that we want to try. We appreciated how the owner came around to each table to introduce himself- it was a nice personal touch.   Summary  get the fried mashed potato bacon appetizer  no reservations  parties of 4 or less for quicker seating.
Eldorado Cafe,323,I love the food at Eldorado Cafe. I have been a customer of Eldorado at the pop-up places  they catered an event  and now as a customer in the new restaurant. The food is always served fresh hot and delicious. There are always veggie options  and the cocktails at the new location use fresh juice.
Eldorado Cafe,324,Enjoyed lunch and dinner here.  Better than the majority of Tex-Mex joints one stumbles upon.  If you enjoy legit TexMex  this place is for you. If Tawko-Bel is your idea of Messkin food  You will hate this place  avoid darkening their doorstep - go get something with baked-on Dorito crumbs.  Staff was great. Very helpful and the servers I dealt with knew the menu well.  Salsa was top shelf. All of it. Some commented that it s spicy or too hot. No way  I loved it all. Guac was excellent.  Carnitas was most excellent.  Chicken enchiladas were most excellent.  Highly recommended  unless you re that Talko-bel lover .
Eldorado Cafe,325,Can t say enough great things about this new spot  It has everything  including the TASTIEST and FRESHEST Texican food this side of anywhere  They ve been doing pop up s and catering for months and now their place is finally opening.  Expect to taste the love and joy of cooking in their special dishes  like Shiny Ribs  Torta s  Enchiladas and their cocktails are made with fresh juice  We plan to be regulars 
Eldorado Cafe,326,Server was fantastic. We were a large party with half of us being kids and she was so patient and brought everything we needed  was on point. She even brought us a salsa sampler without us even asking. We will be back for sure.
Eldorado Cafe,327,Amazing food  Buckle up for flavortown. Highly recommend the cheez and rice side and sirloin tampiqueno. I m usually not huge on beans that come on the side at mexican restaurants  but the beans here were notably good. Very friendly and helpful staff who took and delivered my take out order. They had a nicely set up parking lot  no contact pick up process.
Eldorado Cafe,328,This was my first time here  The food was excellent and the service was fantastic  I ll be back... maybe for happy hour so I can enjoy a nice draft beer at the bar.
Eldorado Cafe,329,Love the decor  love the food  but the it is really loud. If you are looking for a quite cafe to enjoy coffee  maybe work a little. This place is not it.
Eldorado Cafe,330,This place hit every mark perfectly. The service was impeccable. The managers were pleasant and caring and interested in our thoughts about the place  the food was beyond anything that we see here in North Austin in the Mexican realm.   The vibe was like the old Austin that we all miss and love desperately. I will absolutely positively be going here again.   Even if I had been forced to wait for the food. It would ve been worth it.  Unlike most new hipster joints in Austin. This is the real thing.
Eldorado Cafe,331,Walked in on a bustling Tuesday at 8 and were quoted a 30 minute wait.  We actually went in expecting a longer wait  but were promptly seated after only 20 minutes.  Staff was extremely friendly and it seemed to carry over to the customers as we engaged in several conversations with the tables next to us.    The margaritas were decent but next time I ll probably try one of their other delicious looking cocktails.  The medium salsa was roasty  smoky and paired extremely well with the crispy  fresh-tasting chips.  The super kind waitress even brought us a little sample of the super hot salsa which was different but equally well done.  The menu has a lot of excellent choices.  I settled on Rene s enchiladas which were some of the best I ve had.  The filling  the sauce  mmmmmm  Rice was light and flavorful and the beans were a big hit.  My wife got the crispy tacos and boy were they crispy   Eldorado Cafe hits all the right notes.  Great service  great atmosphere  and they really care about their food and it shows.  We had a great time and can t wait to go back.
Eldorado Cafe,332,Our first time in today and we will certainly be back. Not only was the food delicious and inventive  there are A LOT of Mexican and TexMex places here   the service was superlative. We had the Papas Rellenas and Enchiladas with mushrooms and caramelized onions. Both were excellent but the Papas Rellenas stood out as exceptional. Mashed potatoes mixed with goat cheese and lightly fried on a bed of sharp purple cabbage was to. die. for.  It was a lunch date but next time we plan to explore more dishes and the dessert menu.  The wait staff was attentive but not aggressive. And our table and others shared a visit from the convivial and  easy going chef owner. We chatted about our kiddos and he let us know there is a corner with some rad kid toys for littles.  This place definitely earns all five stars 
Eldorado Cafe,333,We LOVE this place  Has amazing food and great options for vegetarians. Get the queso - you won t be disappointed 
Eldorado Cafe,334,The best Mexican food. Great service. Unique atmosphere. Diverse menu  with healthy options. Breakfast. I ve been all over Mexico  Texas  the Southwest. It s the best.
Eldorado Cafe,335,We have been going to the popups at Nomads and Dia s for the past year. So excited that the restaurant is finally open.  Our first visit did not disappoint  with delicious  creative  handmade food and friendly service.
Eldorado Cafe,336,The place is popular.  We waited 30 minutes.  I liked it  but only trendy beer and margarita on the rocks are available.  I d rate it higher if the beer list was longer w traditional and they had a margarita machine. I did order a mango margarita  the taste was off. I did not like it. I tasted a strawberry margarita  it was better. Maybe mango was prefab  idk.  Let me talk about the food. I ordered the chicken breast  mashed and hash. The menu stated breast so I expected a breast. It was shredded and grilled to a dry point. I see someone else noted that sauce would help  perhaps. I ate the mashed and hash  np. Someone had a taco salad and another enchiladas suizas. They said their meals were ok. I agree the comments about price point  I expected more.
Eldorado Cafe,337,The only place in Austin I want to eat hues rancheros  From the lightly fried tortilla to the perfect ranchero sauce to probably the best black beans I ve eaten. But don t forget the Bloody Mary. It s perfect  And if it s lunch or dinner you re after  try the the busted with chimichurri  It s amazing  with my beloved Veggie Moja and Cheesy Rice   Nike  a k a Do It     And not to be omitted  Chef Fried is so very attentive  hands-on  and just damn marvelous that you can understand how it is that he and his wife have assembled the best  happiest  most efficient staff I ve ever encountered. 
Eldorado Cafe,338,Breakfast here is amazing. They ve got some unique breakfast plates that are different and delicious. Highly recommend.
Eldorado Cafe,339,I m just a big fan of the menu they ve put together here. The flavor is less Tex mex and more interior. The salsa choices are varied  I like the X  and the enchiladas are awesome. Suizo sauce for the win. But also the green Chile pulled pork.  This is comfort food for us.   Now if only they had a bigger seating area 
Eldorado Cafe,340,Had a chalupa from their rotating menu and it was delicious  Chile con queso was also very tasty. Nice viscosity--not too thick like it was simply melted American cheese with salsa thrown in. It s clearly still American cheese  but they did it the right way and started with either a bechamel or cornstarch base and saut ed ingredients. Yum    My friend and I both ordered enchiladas  she got the suiza chicken and I had Esme s magic  which are filled with mashed potato and topped with an ancho Chile sauce. Esme s magic are a specialty they re known for.   I did not care for mine. The chile sauce was very sweet and nothing else in the enchilada was strong enough to stand up to it. My friend s chicken enchiladas were delicious   I ll definitely go back and next time if I get enchiladas I ll try Rene s  which have short rib.   Margaritas were strong and good  AC was terrible and everyone was sweating. Check this place out 
Eldorado Cafe,341,I ordered a  Coke   amp  the bartender served me Main Root  without telling me. It s not the same thing. I didn t feel like trying all the salsas  so I asked which one is the most popular. She said it was the salsa X. I thought this one was pretty bland. I guess I ll try a different one next time. I thought that the mashed potatoes had too much skin in them. The crispy tacos were very tasty  but impossible to eat gracefully  so I just crumbled them up  amp  ate them with a fork like a taco salad. I hate to be such a Debbie Downer on this place. It looks like it has a lot of potential  so I will definitely give it another try.
Eldorado Cafe,342,Eldorado cafe is tucked in an out of the way strip mall right at Anderson lane and mopac. The immediate impression is that this is a very approachable and welcoming member of the  keep Austin weird  clan featuring a menu of interesting tales on classic Tex mex  off the wall decor and sweet hipster wait staff.  The food was good  particularly the avocado salsa. While nothing we had was mind blowing  the carnitas had nice caramelization while being very tender  and the mojo chicken was good and limey. The letdown was the enchilada sauce which seemed more like spicy ketchup than a chili sauce.  Overall  a great experience with good food  but probably best to stick to what they do well- carnitas and the big plates.
Eldorado Cafe,343,Sunday at 6 00PM on a 25 min wait...in a funky location in a dark strip center  I had hoped for amazing. Food was okay and service was meh...rather assumptive  like our two top should have known the ins and outs of their menu. Started with their signature queso  with guacamole  black beans  pico...good texture and mild flavors  not much Heath. Had the crispy tacos which  per the waitress  should have changed my life. May have been a lot to live up to  but they were just okay. The salsas with the chips...okay. 3-potato hash...okay. We decided to try the skillet cherry pie  as folks raved about it. The crust was chewy  and the flavor bland...no tartness or much depth  tho a very healthy portion.   All told  nothing bad about the meal  but nothing worthy of the hype imho  or inspiring a return visit. Maybe other things on the menu are better.
Eldorado Cafe,344,Thoroughly enjoyed Eldorado Cafe. I ve been here a couple times  but this time was the most exceptional. Had the Esme Enchiladas  tried all the salsas  and crushed a delightful soapapilla cheesecakes. Call out to Barry who was delightful  his words  Trust the fat man with what food is good.  And this beautiful large man sang truer than any Sunday canary.
Eldorado Cafe,345,Heave on earth.  Went to Eldorado Cafe with my boyfriend at 9p on a weekday and received fresh food and great service.    Our waiter worked really hard and was super polite.  For appetizers  we got to try two different types of salsas and also ordered a giant bowl of queso with black beans  pico and guac.  Main dishes came out and were delicious - my lettuce was actually dark green  haven t seen this before at a restaurant .  Thanks  chefs   I ate as much of my plate as I could.  I can t wait to go back and try out other options.    They can make an entree for gluten free vegans.  I ordered vegetarian food with no problems at all.
Eldorado Cafe,346,So delicious      4 of us ate here yesterday. We ordered several things to share  and I m so glad we did. If you re going to do the same  here are some things to add to your order   House salsa sampler SalsaX is so good   Shiny ribs Papas rellenas Nachos with the beef picadillo Puzchkas Las Calabasas One of the guizos  or maybe a couple  Cherry Pie  Yes  cherry pie. It s awesome. I thought I hated cherry pie. This one changed my mind.  I saw a previous review talking about the ice in the margaritas. I don t get it. My aunt ordered a margarita on the rocks. The ice in her margarita looked fine. Seriously  what s the problem   I m not an  Austin Foodie   nor do I want to be. All I know is that this food is fantastic  
Eldorado Cafe,347,People rant and rave about this place... we finally went and tried it and were very underwhelmed. Maybe we got the wrong things   Not sure.. House margs were not great at all.. at the end we had just wished we went somewhere else that we knew was bomb.
Eldorado Cafe,348,Good service. Versatile menu  nice departure from the same old menu items you find everywhere. Nice ambiance.
Eldorado Cafe,349,We went back and were able to get a table around 4 pm with no wait. While the main dishes are typical tex-mex fare  the sides and the drinks make this place special. Their squash hash with butternut squash and pepitas is amazing. I could eat an entire bowl of it. Their black beans are also fantastic  they have great flavor but they don t make you feel heavy after eating it.  The cocktails  including the mezcal ones  are delicious  I definitely love their creativity with their cocktails.   I definitely go back IF there is no or minimal weight.
Eldorado Cafe,350,Yum Yum Yum  I could have drank salsa-x straight from the bowl  In fact I would have preferred that from the drink that was recommended to me by our server. I was originally going to order a regular margarita but was talked into the tamarindo drink which tasted nothing like a tamarindo and more like margarita mix that went bad. For my appetizer I ordered the papas rellenos which are nothing like you d expect. I was served medium sized fried cheese with a sweet dipping sauce. My friend ordered the quesadilla which was not bad as well. The highlight was definitely the salsa. I d like to come back and taste an entree.
Eldorado Cafe,351,drove by and noticed they were doing a soft opening over the weekend so stopped by to try them out for dinner. the service and atmosphere were great. the salsa and chip sampler was amazing  all 5 salsas were really good but the spiciest one was definitely my favorite. me and my wife both ordered chicken enchiladas and they were very good. they came with rice and black beans which were delicious also and there was definitely enough food to leave with some leftovers for lunch  me and my wife will definitely return and will be seeing if our staff would like to do our next employee dinner there.
Eldorado Cafe,352,Love it - plenty of space and seating for a Saturday.  Had the Nomad and it was delicious. Tried the salsa sampler and liked most of them but the hottest. It has a funky aftertaste.  Only thing was service was a bit slow on refills but other than that we loved it.  Not too loud or busy.  Give it a try.
Eldorado Cafe,353,Hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant in Texas. The food is amazing  servers are knowledgeable and fun to talk to. Had to wait 30 minutes for dinner  but definitely worth the wait. Their salsa is variety is impressive  and their menu is authentic and very delicious. Highly recommend 
Eldorado Cafe,354,Yummy  It was an amazing experience  Amy J. was sooo patient and kind  as my son was running late.  The food was simply delicious   I had the chilaquiles and my son tried the Migas and El hombre tacos  Those tacos were gone so fast    The chilaquiles were so tasty and generously served  Taking some home for later 
Eldorado Cafe,355,A place built with heart and soul that flows into their food  Start with salsa sampler. Each is unique and the flavors packed into each one are amazing. From there  you really can t go wrong. The Suiza sauce is one of my faves and the shiny ribs were also a hit. Oh  and treat yourself to queso- because everyone needs more cheese in their life  I recommend washing it down with a perfectly balanced Tamarindo  solid tequila cocktail .
Eldorado Cafe,356,Great place evidenced by a 20 minute wait on a Sunday evening but worth it. The chips had the right heft to them. Not to thin and not greasy.  The salsas were great. The entrees came out fast hot and flavorful.  Plenty of options adobo pork and pollo with salsa verde both were delicious. It was difficult to choose so a return visit is on the books. A little loud only because of all the hard surfaces and the place being packed but that won t keep you away once you try it.
Eldorado Cafe,357,One of the best Mexican meals we have ever had  including AZ NM and TX  Enchiladas and the home made sauces are superb.   Very friendly staff and the owner is another Austin gem 
Eldorado Cafe,358,Been on several occasions  service and food are always amazing and prices are very reasonable. Try the selection of salsas and enjoy the laid back atmosphere. Breakfast is our favorite  best to go before 10am and avoid the crowds rush.
Eldorado Cafe,359,This food is fantastic. Tried the enchiladas suizas with chicken  the green chili pork tacos and the taco salad. All fantastic. Amazing  fresh drinks. Definitely recommend to anyone 
Eldorado Cafe,360,They squeaked in with a 4-star for service  I personally won t be able to return because they don t have either of my tequila choices  I went with my staple - Suiza  Chicken  Enchiladas. They were good  nothing to write home about  but I m an enchilada snob at this point. The rice and beans were just ok for me.  Nontraditional overall  and I guess in this cuisine I m a traditionalist  I did try a non-standard tequila...and highly recommend the mango margarita  towards the bottom of the menu  couple of flavor options . Tasty - if you like mango or worth a try if the other flavors appeal to you. It was a Sunday night  - packed house of smiling faces. I really enjoyed people watching. Plenty of parking in a strip mall parking lot - that slows for dinner  at least. The best part was the service though. If you aren t in a hurry - wait to order your main course. You will have food before you know it  Expect them to check in plenty of times and always service with a smile  Enjoy 
Eldorado Cafe,361,My friends  amp  I had never been here before  amp  they have been living here for 10 year  me only 2 . I m so glad we went the food was great  amp  so was the service. We went for brunch  amp  while it was a bit busy it wasn t too bad 
Eldorado Cafe,362,I m not much of a fan of  New Mexico  style Mexican food  but thought I d give this a try since it s in the neighborhood.  Started with the house margarita on the rocks - excellent and had a nice kick. For my entree I ordered the  Enchiladas Classicas .  Food came quickly but when I took one bite I realized the enchiladas were covered in ancho chile sauce  which I hate.  This was completely my fault since I didn t read the menu description thoroughly.  There was no way I was going to try to send the food back since it was my mistake  but when our server asked me how my meal was I explained my dislike of ancho chile sauce  while assuring her it was nobody s fault but mine.  She immediately offered to replace my entree with something else at no charge.  I selected the nachos compuestos and they were some of the best nachos I ve ever put in my mouth   This is STELLAR customer service.  Can t wait to come back 
Eldorado Cafe,363,One word  WOW  Unbelievable food  and I am tough with restaurants.  Located in a  nameless  shopping center  desolate  pretty bland outside. Then you come inside and the most amazing food experience is waiting for you.
Eldorado Cafe,364,Joel    Congrats  You and your team are doing an amazing job  Keep up the good work and don t take Yelp too seriuolsy. Some people just have nothing better to do in their life than be negative when people need to be spreading more positivty. Glad you re part of the Anderson Lane Crew 
Eldorado Cafe,365,Pleasantly surprised to find this gem finally open. We had heard great reviews from a local business and couldn t wait to try it for ourselves. We were not disappointed  Both my husband and I had build your own breakfast tacos.  The fried over easy eggs were cooked to perfection with a warm runny yolk. We each picked different ingredients including tasteful black beans  crispy bacon  delightful jack cheese and avocado.  We tried the mild and the X salsa.   The latter salsa was so delicious we bought 2 containers to take home.   We will definitely come back again   
Eldorado Cafe,366,Hands down the best plate of Mexican food I ve had in Austin  and I ve been here for 12 years. I had Rene s Awesome Enchiladas and I gotta say  WELL NAMED. The chips and homemade salsas are delicious  our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful with suggestions  the owner stopped by to check in on us  and the desserts  Mexican cheesecake and lemon raspberry  were insanely good.   I expected a long wait at 11a on a Saturday but our table was ready in 15 minutes  despite the place being packed. Can t wait to go back to try the breakfast 
Eldorado Cafe,367,The food here is phenomenal  and the people are amazing. The shiny ribs are quite simply a spiritual experience. Best Carnitas I ve ever had  super crispy and not fatty at all. Everything from the appetizers to the drinks was fantastic  and we will be back as many times as we can.
Eldorado Cafe,368,Always a winner  I ve had multiple experiences with them and they are definitely a favorite.
Eldorado Cafe,369,I give the above rating not only for the amazing food and bar but for the staff and the owner.  First the food...have yet to find a dish that was just average and quality is consistent. Next the people...staff is friendly and cool as s  amp     The owners makes you feel like you ve walked into his home.  Great personality and very authentic. Our go to spot when we decide not to cook at home.
Eldorado Cafe,370,Got dinner here last week and it was just delicious. Friends and I split the papas rellenas  so good  and the salsa sampler.  Listen  that salsa X just does it for me. You could pour that over a shoe and I would eat it. I hope you find a way to bottle and sell it because I want it on EVERYTHING. I want to cook with it.  Moving on  I had the crispy pork carnitas and it.was.fantastic. You want this. I had the squash and potatoes for my sides and everything was great and perfect. I don t remember what everyone else got  but all five of us were very happy with our meals. OH  AND THE SOPAPILLA CHEESECAKE. Yeah  get that. We got it to go and it was amazing even the next day.
Eldorado Cafe,371,Great experience at El Dorado.  The staff was extremely friendly  both the manager and our waitress   food was great  salsa sampler  short rib enchiladas  and Carnitas were all delicious .  This might be our new favorite Mexican in town.
Eldorado Cafe,372,This place is  simply put  amazing. They opened a couple weeks ago  and it is already one of my favorite places in Austin. The place is adorable  the staff are all friendly and attentive  and the food and drinks were perfection.  There was a wait the night we went  so we posted up at the bar with some queso and drinks. The drinks were delicious - made with fresh squeezed juice - and the queso was sublime.  When we got seated  we were treated to great service and some of the best food I have had in my life. We started with the shiny ribs  which were cooked to perfection and properly messy. My girlfriend had the Joel s Happy Plate  2 cheese enchiladas hugging a beef enchilada. While I only had a few bites  I would easily rate these the best enchiladas I have had in Austin  coming from El Paso  I feel this is high praise . I ordered the Carnitas  which were perfect - moist with the proper amount of  crunch    In short - this place is great. The ambiance was adorable  the staff  a lot of youngsters  were all exceedingly nice and attentive  there were some opening week problems  but for a place that has been packed to the gills since it opened  this is to be expected and was nothing at all out of the norm   and the food was delicious  the Scorpion salsa  which took 1st place in the Specialty Category at the Hot Sauce competition last weekend  by the way  will light you up - you have been warned 
Eldorado Cafe,373,I love this place. We went last night for the first time and I hope we go back soon. The staff is great  our waiter s name was Travis and he was wonderful. We tried a variety of the salsas and they were all delicious. I don t think you can go wrong with any of their food. I had the Rene s enchiladas and they were delicious. They had really large portions  The margaritas aren t cheap but they are tasty. We had a 20 minute wait on a Thursday at 6 so be prepared for a little wait when you go. It s well worth the wait 
Eldorado Cafe,374,I ve eaten here four or five times and really don t understand how they get all these great reviews. Margarita are good...but the food   Traditional TexMex it is not. The very small salad was better than the tacos or enchiladas  and that s not even TexMex.
Eldorado Cafe,375,El Dorado has fantastic food and has been very responsible in the pandemic - great social distancing has allowed me to get this great food.
Eldorado Cafe,376,We recently had Eldorado caterer a dinner for about 16 people   Our event was pushed up and their top flight team were kind enough to prep the food about an hour earlier than we had first requested.    We were very impressed with the amount of food  quality of food and everything even came with strong serving utensils.   Plates and silverware included      Our guest were absolutely in love with all the unique flavors of the meat and the green chicken chili enchiladas.    They loved that we received three different types of salsa.  Each with different heat  texture and taste.     We have had meals inside the restaurant prior to ordering this dinner - we can wait to go back now    Thanks for helping to make our dinner amazing 
Eldorado Cafe,377,Amazing meal  service and atmosphere  Owner comes by and checks on each table s experience and makes great connections with patrons. Delicious  thoughtful dishes and drinks. We got the Vegan enchiladas  phenomenal  and the nachos  single masterpieces on each chip  not an mess like other places. Highly recommend 
Eldorado Cafe,378,I ve been to ElDorado Cafe several times  and it s always been delicious  Tonight  we went with our big family for my daughter s last night before heading back to school. I was one of the high maintenance customers who was on a restricted diet. Joel the owner made me an amazing dinner that completely fit my dietary restrictions  and everyone s meals were perfect  I highly recommend ElDorado Cafe  You won t be disappointed 
Eldorado Cafe,379,Recently took the work tribe here for National Margarita Day.  Food  drinks  and especially the service were all  outstanding.  We will be back   Heck  may go there for brunch today 
Eldorado Cafe,380,The food here is great. Service was really good. I can t wait to come back.  I loved the Big Papas taco and the Migas taco. The queso was so tasty.
Eldorado Cafe,381,We recently tried this place for the first time.  It was so good   We came on a Sunday for lunch and it was crowded but they found a way to seat us as quickly as possible.  The service was great and the food was really good.  We came back a week or so later for the happy hour and we loved the margaritas and the tacos and quesadillas.  And you cannot beat their happy hour prices   Not only are the food and drinks awesome  but the service stands out.  Everyone is nice and helpful and you can tell they really enjoy working there.  The owners seem to be taking really good care of their employees  We will be back again many times and we have already been telling all of our friends and family members about it 
Eldorado Cafe,382,Put this place on your to go list   Drinks-amazing  Service-amazing  Salsa-hello Heaven. As a New Mexican-hello Red Chile sauce  I will be a regular here   Chef-your Red Chile is on point  
Eldorado Cafe,383,I think maybe we had too high expectations based off of all the great reviews. The service was amazing  but did not feel the food was all that great even if its not going for Tex mex or authentic Mexican. We had the enchiladas   Suizas which lacked flavor. The salsa sampler was decent. We do appreciate the great service though 
Eldorado Cafe,384,Wish I could give more than 5 stars  I haven t been compelled to write a review for any restaurants in quite a while but this place went above and beyond both in quality tastiness of food AND in service. Seriously can t wait to go back. After their amazing salsa sampler  we had the short rib tacos and they were crazy good. Very affordable  very tasty  incredibly friendly and great vibe  If you re on the fence  just go ... you won t be disappointed.
Eldorado Cafe,385,Consistently great  The wait is never terrible  the food is always on point  and usually the servers are top shelf. The only weird thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was on our last visit when the hostess grabbed my son s drink out of his hand and said  you can t have this .  Literally grabbed it from him.  The drink was actually gone  it was my glass of sangria that had berries in it. My 15 year old son can absolutely have my fruit from a glass of wine  definitely not her call  and they way she did it left us flabbergasted. Especially because it was done in front of a party of 10 that included family and co workers of my husbands that I had never met.  Anyway  the food is great and this was Hopefully a one off for us. Unfortunately for the rest of the group that was their first and last impression because they were from out of town. Just a bit embarrassing
Eldorado Cafe,386,Deeeeelish and very friendly  I will definitely be back to the El Dorado caf  in the future. I think my favorite of all the items was the salsa the salsa ex is to die for.
Eldorado Cafe,387,The carnitas at this place were next level good.  The atmosphere reminded me a bit of cafe java on metric by ACC  its like cafe java with good mexican food.
Eldorado Cafe,388,There s a reason people are lining up outside even on the week nights  We finally made it in to try things out and loved everything  We tried the salsa sampler which was a conversation piece in itself because you know  these things are worth discussing as you enjoy them  Great margaritas and enchiladas  I also had a wonderful salad that I ll be thinking of in the future  Who says that about salad   That s how delicious it was  Hope to come back soon 
Eldorado Cafe,389,We went to El Dorado for a late lunch yesterday. First time for us both. Several friends had highly recommended it and we were not at all disappointed. We had the salsas five ways  queso  the Thunder Rosa taco and Migas. Everything was delicious. I am not a huge fan of black beans  but I thought the beans at El Dorado were outstanding. The staff  our server AND at the register  were really great. We will be back many times   probably this week  Rated it as 4 out of 5 only because every restaurant can get even better 
Eldorado Cafe,390,I should not be writing this review because I don t want the word to get out about how great Eldorado is   But I do want to share how good the food is and help my local restaurant get business.   My SO and I go here weekly and have never been disappointed. The food is super tasty and the atmosphere is super cute.  Do not let the strip mall location fool you  this is one of the best eateries in Austin. It s one of our faves for a quick dinner or a date night with drinks and dessert  the whole nine yards .   I recommend any of the quesadillas and Cubano Carnitas for dinner. Oh and for breakfast I recommend the Nomad.
Eldorado Cafe,391,Went for the first time tonight and must admit El Dorado lived up to the hype. Food was all excellent as well as the cocktails. Salsas were really great.
Eldorado Cafe,392,We loved everything we had during their soft opening   The fried potato and bacon appetizer was super yummy  as were the shiny ribs  always a favorite  and the panzenella. I actually liked it better with the cheese they use then the usual mozzarella.  The carnitas plate was great and so were the verde enchiladas. Favorite sides were the rice and the calabasas.  Can t wait to go back and try more stuff  They open with the full menu August 8th.
Eldorado Cafe,393,Eldorado Cafe. muchas gracias for Server Kiki G and all the staff with yummy food and ritas in hand.  I love the music  ZZ Top my fav  easy listening and atmosphere is lovely.
Eldorado Cafe,394,Setting - enter. 1pm. 35 minute wait. First thought - this place must be good. Holy balls  was it ever. Run  don t walk  to this place. Get the supa queso. Get the salsa x. Get lit. Let s go baby 
Eldorado Cafe,395,I m adding to all the five star reviews because this place is amazing  They even have a little kids area in front. So brilliant. The food and drinks are delicious. Highly recommended 
Eldorado Cafe,396,This was our first visit to ElDorado and it won t be our last. I ordered the Hongo meal with garlic mash potatoes  amp  veggies. It comes with 2 flour or corn tortillas and was fresh  amp  delicious. I was particularly pleased with the salsas. Usually a restaurant will claim their salsa is hot  but the spiciness will be nonexistent. Not so at ElDorado - the spicy salsa gripped my tongue in a vice of volcanic heat  amp  would not let go    We have plans to return and check their breakfast menu 
Eldorado Cafe,397,My wife and I stopped here for breakfast and we really enjoyed it.   We ordered The Migas Plate and the The Nomad Plate- along with a biscuit and jam. I also had a cup of coffee.   The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable- I don t know how long it has been there but it looked relatively new. The decor was Austin Tex-Mex casual  and I thought it looked great.   Our waitress was quick  friendly and attentive - without being intrusive.   The food  labeled as comfort food  was fairly traditional  but with some house made flair. The breakfast potatoes were a combination of sweet and white potatoes  with onion and bell pepper strips. We both loved them. The black refried beams were tasty and the eggs themselves were also tender and fluffy.   The homemade biscuit was large and looked great  but was more like toast in consistency than a biscuit. The jam was outstanding. It had a wonderful flavor and aroma.   To top it off  the coffee was much better than typical diner coffee. Good deep flavor  not burnt  and cream  or whole milk  in a chilled stainless mini pitcher.
Eldorado Cafe,398,I ve been here 3 times in 2 months now because I can t stop thinking about the Carne Adovado. It s amazing  And the margaritas are fresh and delicious. Expect a wait as it s popular and small but I will definitely be back again and again  
Eldorado Cafe,399,I went here for breakfast with friends and was most disappointed. Be prepared for tables crammed tightly together.  What really bothered me was that ALL the breakfast dishes come with beans and potatoes -- no substitutions.  I asked if there were any breakfast items that I could order a la carte  without beans and potatoes .  The response was  I can bring out your order without the sides but you re still going to pay for them.   Nearly all Mexican restaurants in town offer substitutions or a la carte items but not here.  If you re not a big starch eater or diabetic  steer clear.
Eldorado Cafe,400,I told Amy   our waitress that I felt like I died and gone to heaven  she was excellent and went above and beyond to ensure we were satisfied. Christy the manager walked around with a smile on her face and stopped by to greet us. Love this place  food and service was excellent   Definitely be back 
Eldorado Cafe,401,This is  hands-down  my favorite restaurant in town. I would call it a hidden gem - tucked away as it is in a kind of random strip mall right beside Mopac - but clearly there are a ton of other people who love it as much as I do  since the place is always busy. It s well worth the wait  though  and I always come away happy. The food is generally wholesome  delicious  and always prompt. It s a great place to go to accommodate groups with disparate eating   food preferences  i.e. near-carnivores and vegans can both find something awesome   and they try hard to accommodate all sorts of diets.   Beyond that  the place just radiates warmth and friendly neighborhood vibes - I regularly see the owners and veteran waiter-folks stopping by to chat with folks who come in regularly.  Some tips   Las Calabasas is probably my favorite thing on the menu  delectably rich little pieces of squash happiness  with pepitas and basil to boot.  The other sides are also generally the bomb - you can t go wrong   The best salsa by far is Salsa X.  Try the enchiladas with the mashed potatoes inside - forget what it s called  but it s awesome.  I leave every single time in a great mood. Long live El Dorado 
Eldorado Cafe,402,Not a type of person to write a review but I had to let my experience be known considering the fact that this place had really good reviews    Let me start by saying our table was given to a party that had just walked in after we sat their waiting for over 30 minutes  Maybe my skin color had to be white to get seated right away  Our waiter forgot about our appetizer and the food was mediocre  definitely not worth the wait. I am happy to say that I will not be returning to this so called restaurant 
Eldorado Cafe,403,Yelp user for years but this is my first review. I use Yelp to find places and get an idea about them. I hope to provide that useful information  but I also have something to say about the other reviews  since I can t comment directly on them haha. We ll get to that...  El Dorado Cafe was excellent. First time there. Already know for sure we ll be going back who knows how many times. Our server  Eric  was great. Recommended sauce X  and it was yum. If you re a salsa snob  give it a rest  bring your own  I dunno. For the casual chips and dip before the real thing... excellent salsa.  We got there around 2pm. Were told 15 minute wait. Got seated after 5 minutes. They serve breakfast until 3pm. I got Joey s happy plate  girlfriend got Gloria s Chilaquiles. There were probably ten or more other things on the menu we wish we had the stomachs to try. I m definitely going to get something on the breakfast menu next time.  We both cleaned our plates. Very good food. Friendly servers. Owner manager or someone in charge came by to ask us how we were.  This place has 4 stars as of now. It should have 5. You guys  Yelp is here to help others find good places to go. It s not about you. Somebody gave this place 1 star because they don t take reservations and they wanted one. No mention of the food or service. It s a small cafe. Go to Chili s or something if you need reservations  you dummies. Another person gave them 1 star because they ve been several times and there s always a wait  Uhhh doesn t that mean they re good  Sorry you had to wait  but you should realize nobody waits 40 minutes for a 1 star restaurant. They wait because this place is awesome.  Don t Yelp for your own satisfaction. Yelp to help.
Eldorado Cafe,404,Super great. I ordered the tamarindo but it did not taste like a tamarindo at all. The quesadilla was good and salsa was so good I wanted to drink it. I m definitely going back 
Eldorado Cafe,405,Had dinner and it was pretty good. Definitely recommend getting an appetizer because the meal portion sizes were slightly small.  We got the salsa sampler which was pretty good. Overall the service was great.
Eldorado Cafe,406,My favorite place for casual Mexican dinner - interesting cocktails and terrific flavors .
Eldorado Cafe,407,One of my fianc  and I s favorite brunch spots. We always opt to sit at the bar. Great  friendly  attentive service. Our favorite dishes are the Tio White Potato and La Bomba. Also really enjoyed the Suadorado  horchata plus chameleon cold brew .
Eldorado Cafe,408,Salsa X is so good it s dangerous    I had the taco salad  it was super fresh and delicious.  I also tasted the Cubano that is also super yummy. The waiter was nice and friendly and provided great service.
Eldorado Cafe,409,Perfect Brunch  Me and 16 of my closest friends  and 2 precious babies  had breakfast at El Dorado yesterday. They don t take reservations but I did call in advance to warn them of our large party. They made everything easy breezy. We love tasting  ALL  of the amazing salsas and yummy food. I loved showing my friends my new favorite place to eat in Austin 
Eldorado Cafe,410,Amazing little hole in the wall. Fantastic food  great service  and a lovely restaurant.
Eldorado Cafe,411,I have yet to have anything bad here  And I ve definitely had things that were unique and delicious  like the pork tacos I had today with the candied onions and pineapple pico  The workers are the friendliest  the salsa selection fantastic  and the drink specials all contribute to making this my favorite restaurant in Austin. I ve only written one other restaurant review on Yelp  and that was to warn people  so...
Eldorado Cafe,412,Awesome    Really diverse menu. The owner is a chef and you can really tell he loves what he s doing.  By far my favorite new restaurant 
Eldorado Cafe,413,The service was great and the food tasted even better  We re not from the area and they treated us with a free dessert and made sure we were well taken care of  Will definitely be recommending them to our friends and family.
Eldorado Cafe,414,Excellent   I was looking for a new brunch spot to take my friend from Denver. This place was the perfect combo of brunch fun with Austin style breakfast tacos. She said her tacos were two of the best she s ever had.  Amy behind the bar made us delicious Sunday Funday cocktails and Joel came out to say hello and ensure our food was good.  Loved the vibe and the good tunes. Will definitely be going back soon 
Eldorado Cafe,415,I have been twice  once during a soft opening and another time this past week. Both times I had excellent customer service and delicious food. Both times were very busy. Once you order a drink at the bar  there s a stylish lounge area in the back where you can wait for your table.   Menu highlights  so far   pork green chile  carne adovado  order with a side of mashed potatoes    papas rellenas  supa queso. I have tried several more items at their previous pop-up at Dia s market and assume they will be just as good if not better here. The salsas are fresh and consistently awesome  salsa X  el scorpio  . The house margarita is great  I also really enjoyed the sandista  watermelon cocktail . They have available the watermelon agua fresca for kids. There is also a kid area in front and a kid section of the menu.   The restaurant itself is beautiful and exudes such a pleasant vibe. The only  problem  is that we ve had to wait a bit here and there for a table or food or drinks  but that doesn t deter us. We plan to go back often 
Eldorado Cafe,416,I absolutely LOVE this place  Food is amazing and the staff super friendly. The owner seems to always be on site and attending to any and all needs. My boyfriend and I had been looking for a great new place  as we had grown a bit tired of the regular spots  Maudie s  Chuys  places like that.   The food here  I honestly can t say enough. Most places  especially Tex-mex spots  can give me stomach aches rather quickly  due tothe amount of oils and poor food brands produce used for the dishes. I don t get anything like that here.   Highly recommend  
Eldorado Cafe,417,Just in ATX for a quick visit and we went to the nearest place with great reviews.  We both got the enchiladas classicas-  they were potent  I could still taste the bitterness hours later.  I think it s an attempt to make an authentic enchilada sauce  but it s a major fail.  Since you want to go authentic  why the weird white rice that has nothing to do with mexican rice   The sopapilla cheesecake was ok  but why is it called cheesecake if it s more of a flan taste and texture    I would go by here if I was starving  but probably not. We were given a choice of 2 salsas  I asked for both and we were told that would be an extra  1.50.... ok fine  except neither was great  so I should have asked them to waive it.  Honestly  this place was so disappointing that I would have given it fewer stars... HOWEVER   our waiter was attentive  maybe a little much with the menu description and Spanish food term lesson  and the restroom was clean  and smelled delightful  they even have a jar with tampons in the stall  how thoughtful  
Eldorado Cafe,418,I ve been coming this restaurant constantly since I moved from Los Angeles to Austin. This is the best Tex- Mex restaurant So far . Not only the food but also the cocktails are amazing. I wish you guys would add some SEA FOOD  I really wish that as a PESCATARIAN   costumer. Also  the staff is amazing 
Eldorado Cafe,419,We met some friends here for dinner last night and I was pretty underwhelmed.  The wait wasn t bad and the service was okay.    I liked the house margarita - it wasn t too sweet and was fairly strong.   Husband ordered two Negra Modelos  a glass of house wine and a house margarita and it was  29 before tip - a little steep.   We ordered the flauta app and guac - both came out quick and both were pretty tasty.  The menu is varied  and it s not tex-mex which is a-okay with me.  But prices are pretty steep for what they re offering.  I had the chicken tinga with two sides  can t remember what they called it - maybe Chi Chi .  I picked garlic mashed potatoes and a side salad.  Both of those were fine - the potatoes weren t hot.  The chicken consisted of pieces of breast meat - and on the dry and tough side and the sauce was fine.  Not amazing but wasn t bad.  For  15.95 though - I expected to be a little more wowed.    We ordered the sopapilla cheesecake and I was SO excited for this as it s one of my favorite deserts.  This one was served warm  it s cheesecake for goodness sake   and it was super dry.  Wasn t even close to being okay.  We had breakfast here last summer  and it was really good  and we had wanted to come back for dinner.    But  after last night  I kinda doubt we ll be back.  Maybe for breakfast if we find ourselves back in the area but definitely not for dinner again.
Eldorado Cafe,420,Finally tried this place after driving by it hundreds of times with my girlfriend. Food  drinks  service  and atmosphere are fantastic. This place is literally better than kerbey lane and magnolia cafe and flies under the radar. Arturo and Marisa are killing the game at the bar making bomb drinks and being SUPA dope.
Eldorado Cafe,421,Happy to eat in it take out.  Delicious  fresh  affordable food. Great bar   So happy to have a neighborhood restaurant 
Eldorado Cafe,422,Good flavors for Tex mex  but skimpy on meat in the dish- mainly fillers of the chips. Salsa had a burned flavor.
Eldorado Cafe,423,I found this place via the Austin Chronicle. Comfort food is a good description as it was certainly rich. I had Rene s awesome enchiladas and my buddy had Joel s happy plate. Both were great. One knock is that they only allow one salsa for free. I think that they should allow sampling of smaller size salsas so you can figure out which one you like best. Otherwise  great spot that I will be returning to.
Eldorado Cafe,424,When we first arrived we were greeted by a very nice hostess who informed us that the wait time for a party of 10 would be about 45 minutes.  We waited for an hour while other parties who arrived after us were being seated.  When we finally sat down our waiter seemed annoyed at the fact she had 10-11 different orders.  The food and drinks took a very long time to arrive and one order was never delivered yet charged for.  When we asked for our checks. The waiter brought back one large check and suggested we all split it evenly because she could not split the check. From my previous experiences restaurants who wait on large parties will ask if the checks will be split and if so among who so there is no confusion at the end.  When the checks arrived a second time two were repeated  one of our party guest asked for a to go box for her leftovers and was brought a piece of foil paper. Overall the waiter seem inpatient  and annoyed to with our party.    Overall  the food was okay. The service was horrible.  I would not recommend it for a party of 6 or more people.
Eldorado Cafe,425,I have been for breakfast and for lunch. Breakfast was just ok  nothing special. The waitress was not very helpful about gluten free and dairy free offerings.   Lunch was fabulous. The waiter was very knowledgeable about gluten and dairy free contents of the menu. He checked on us regularly for anything we might need. The Carne Adovado was sensational as were the frijoles  I d order them again in a heartbeat. The mojo veg weren t cooked properly  the carrots were hard and the cauliflower was overdone. I ll order something else instead of that next time. My date loved his enchiladas classicas.
Eldorado Cafe,426,I came here once and immediately left because the server was pretty short and rude. It almost made me not want to come back. I mean this place is packed and it s in a north Austin strip mall.  Now- I got in this time because I was a solo person at the bar.  LET ME TELL YOU- within the time I got my food - I assume he owner or chef came to check on me. He was definitely not a staff member. But the most AMAZING PART- I m sitting next to a blind man. In the time I ve been here they ve had a woman physically help him to his seat  a seasoned server explain basically the whole menu for him and wait while he was doing the decision process in his head  have a male staff member escort him to the bathroom  and have engaging very helpful and non condescending conversations with him.  This truly was great. Besides the hosts seemingly bad attitude I was so pleased.
Eldorado Cafe,427,Incredible food and really good margaritas  Get the house salsa  believe it is called salsa  X  . Looking forward to having brunch here again.
Eldorado Cafe,428,Delicious food  I m vegan and my friend was keto and we were able to find yummy options  It was also pretty inexpensive  Their salsa was delicious  100  recommend  Just don t get the michelada  only thing I didn t care for.
Eldorado Cafe,429,Food is good. The servers are really odd at this place though. Been here twice. The dude that waited on us Sunday was acting like we were doing something wrong by sitting and ordering not sure what his deal was.  Week before similarly quirky waiter seemed like he had something. Going on too. Maybe the kitchen isn t nice to the waitstafff or they need a better manager     Food sure is good
Eldorado Cafe,430,The mild avocado hot sauce is divine and the medium as well. Everything is super fresh and tasty. So glad to have a New Mexican spot. Yummy for my tummy and the service is spot on 
Eldorado Cafe,431,Eldorado has great food and drinks.  El Scorpio salsa has the perfect spice level and taste.
Eldorado Cafe,432,The food was fairly good  but the restaurant is VERY loud. My friends at the same table couldn t hear me. Why go out 
Eldorado Cafe,433,Try the La Bomba   Trust me. This is such a cute  delicious breakfast find. My partner and I really want to come back for lunch or dinner and try the salsa platter  because the one that came with her migas was smoky and divine. Great atmosphere  super friendly service. 5 stars  
Eldorado Cafe,434,Found this place listed in Austin Monthly magazine on a Christmas trip home and immediately looked it up on Yelp. Solid restaurant choice away from the parking hassles of downtown and South Congress Avenue  Had the 3 enchilada plate and it was reasonably priced and delicious....nothing extraordinary but nice non-chain option with a menu for everyone.
Eldorado Cafe,435,I must confess that the whole week leading up to my trip to Eldorado Cafe  I had eaten tacos every day and the actually day of  I had Torchy s for lunch. It s not very often that I order a salad at a restaurant  but this visit was one of those exceptions. I got to try two different salsas. The medium one which was salsa x and the hot one which I can t remember the name. Salsa X was amazing   I can t quite put my finger on what s so good about it but I think I loved it because it s super garlicky  The fresh hot chips were pretty great with the salsa x too. Then I moved on to order the Taco Salad. Holy guacamole this is the best taco salad I ve ever had  The chicken  pickled onions  avocado  lettuce  and everything else they put in tasted so great all mixed in. I chose the sesame arbol dressing and it was the cherry on top  Mmmm the combinations of flavors was just to die for  I can t remember what the rest of my party ordered because I was way too into my salad and that s saying something.
Eldorado Cafe,436,We read about this restaurant in the newspaper and thought we d try it out....we were NOT disappointed    The food was fabulous BUT the customer service was even better...we had a blast reminiscing with the owner about old Austin places    We ve been in Austin since 1974 and have seen a lot of changes...restaurants come and go...hope this one is around a long time  
Eldorado Cafe,437,We had a wonderful time at El Dorado this morning  Our waitress and the owner were welcoming  warm and friendly.  From the moment we walked in we had the feeling of old Austin.  The food was fresh and delicious. I had the Migas and my Wife had the Huevos Rancheros. Both were exceptional and a different take on traditional Tex-Mex.  Thank You to Joel and his Friendly crew.  This was our first time and we will definitely come back 
Eldorado Cafe,438,Seriously this place is fantastic. The Carnitas Cubanas were excellent. Also the Joey plate. The enchilada sauce is made from scratch and absolutely delicious. Get the spicy salsa and queso. You can not go wrong eating here. Our new favorite place for after hockey practice 
Eldorado Cafe,439,Consistently great  This has become our go to breakfast spot over the last year. Even when we switch it up from our usual- Freddie s plate  Matt s Everything Taco  Nomad plate- we have never left disappointed. I have attempted to re create the potato hash breakfast side at home  mine doesn t compare  because it is so unique and flavor filled. I am a harsh Mexican food critic so the fact that we have been pleased with every menu item we have tried at breakfast  lunch  or dinner is a huge win 
Eldorado Cafe,440,I LOVE ELDORADO    It is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The food is delicious  the service is great  and the staff is super friendly. Their Salsa X and Verde get two thumbs up. I m a personal big fan of the Fuertes plates and the enchiladas. My boyfriend loves their breakfast  especially the Nomad plate. I honestly can t say anything other than good things. 5 STARS      
Eldorado Cafe,441,The margaritas here are the best   Came here for some drinks with a friend and we ended up also having dinner. The food was great and the salsa was tasty and definitely different. We both had enchiladas and left stuffed.
Eldorado Cafe,442,O M G this is such good food Mmmmmm ....everything on menu is delightful  We have been many times and not disappointed in the lest...not even once  I highly recommend this place....it is worth every minute of the wait time to be seated   The Service is the best I have had in anywhere. I really liked how the staff work together to make things happen fast 
Eldorado Cafe,443,Always delicious.  The owner often comes by our table to check on us whenever we eat here.  Good vibes.  Everything is made fresh and we enjoy the unique recipes.  The salsa is divine  salsa x is our fav.  The shiny ribs are awesome.  We ve always had a good experience.  It can get crowded 
Eldorado Cafe,444,This place is amazing. Good people  great atmosphere  even better food. 10 10 would recommend.
Eldorado Cafe,445,This place. Everything is good.  From the staff to the chips to the fantastic main dishes to vegetable medley.  Seriously who does a bangin veggie medley   They do. It s crowded always because it s so good.  A testament to their talent. There are 7234 Mexican restaurants in Austin  totally made  up number but seems realistic  this one is where I take my out of town guests.    Keep doin it y all   You rule 
Eldorado Cafe,446,There s so much great Mexican food to be had in Austin and this is some of the very best I ve had in over 20 years of living here. Our party of three had the Short Rib Salpicon  Enchiladas Suizas  chicken   and Guisos de la Casa  hongos - vegan . Sides varied and all were delicious. The salsa sampler is a must  the avocado salsa was a unanimous favorite . Cocktails were very good. It s a bustling little place with a cheerful atmosphere and extremely friendly staff. The best part were so many of both great vegetarian and vegan options. It s not easy to find unique and filling dishes for non-meat eaters and I really appreciate the accommodating menu. I honestly can t wait to go back.
Eldorado Cafe,447,This is our first time here and we will definitely come back. Great chips and salsas  Our waitress Amy was smart and informative. The shiny ribs weee amazing and the enchiladas were great  We were so glad to find this hidden gem 
Eldorado Cafe,448,I am a Tex-mex loving pescatarian that recently found out I m also lactose intolerant. Well  the veganchilladas here are so good  I don t even miss the dairy  I also love the atmosphere and decor  super cute yet cozy. Friendly service and they always have been fairly quick with getting my food out 
Eldorado Cafe,449,Pretty good spot  The salsa sampler was really fun  and I enjoyed my enchiladas. The staff was really friendly  and knowledgeable about the menu. Looking forward to trying more dishes 
Eldorado Cafe,450,Great place  great food and great management. Met the owner who takes the time to talk to everyone  while we thoroughly enjoyed a salsa sampler and two  entrees. His attentive approach shows through in the service  and the food was distinct and delicious and priced very reasonably. We ll be back soon 
Eldorado Cafe,451,As a proud Houstonian  I ve found it hard to find good Mexican food in Austin. I know this is a controversial topic to Austinites  but finding replacements for my favorite Houston Mexican spots in Austin has been tough. Not to mention  finding a fresh tortilla is almost impossible. All that being said  El Dorado is a godsend and I am so happy to have found this place. Make sure to try the salsa sampler and the Carnitas Cubanas.
Eldorado Cafe,452,Yummy food and margaritas  Not traditional Mexican or TexMex but delicious nonetheless. Sauces and dressings are fresh and homemade. We ll be back when we have a hankering for something outside the Mexican TexMex box.
Eldorado Cafe,453,My Uncle drove in from Dallas to take me to dinner.  A friend recommended this place and he was so impressed he bought me a gift card to take my friend to dinner there   Awesome food  awesome atmosphere and our waiter Hollis was awesome as well  
Eldorado Cafe,454,Quickly earning a spot on my list of top Austin restaurants. The chilieverde salsa is a perfect mix of spice and flavor  though for those with a high spice tolerance might want more kick.   We ve been for breakfast and lunch  both are strongly recommended.
Eldorado Cafe,455,Awesome food and service. Family-owned Austin business. I m a vegetarian  and they have delicious options for me and my meat-eating friends. Wish I could give 6 stars   
Eldorado Cafe,456,I m a local neighborhood patron and I ve been here several times  especially for breakfast. I absolutely love the food and service. The waitstaff was attentive  friendly and generally helpful. My only complaint is that the squash side dish on more recent occasions wasn t cooked enough  same with the three potato hash. When it s cooked right both are amazing   I love their take on the more interior Mexican dishes  I m more traditional Tex-Mex for enchiladas and prefer different sauces  more San Antonio style Chile con carne gravy like. But that s personal preference I guess. Their breakfast tacos and delicious salsas are my favorite in town.
Eldorado Cafe,457,Came in on a Sunday night and was seated immediately. The chips and salsa came immediately and the server was nice enough to let our table try a mild  medium and hot salsa for free. All 3 were good  I dont remember exactly what type was which . I went for Joel s Happy Plate  which I thought would be more substantial for 3 enchiladas. I ended up cleaning my plate and being slightly hungry still which was strange for a Tex-Mex place. The flavors of the dish were nice but not overly spicy. The black beans on the side were seasoned and garnished well  and the rice dish was nice too. The enchiladas themselves were solid but not spectacular  with the only remarkable thing being that the 1 beef enchilada was really well filled with beef for an enchilada. Overall a good tex-mex place and I would choose this over many other options in the area.
Eldorado Cafe,458,A new favorite neighborhood spot  They have a variety of salsas to choose from  delicious queso  cocktails  and desserts. Reasonably priced and delicious  right down the road. The staff is friendly and helpful  too.
Eldorado Cafe,459,Amazing food. Great margaritas. Terrific staff. Will definitely be back. Joel welcomed us and made certain we were satisfied with the food   drink and service.
Eldorado Cafe,460,We all loved this place   Very tasty food that is higher quality than most joints.  It s a bit more Mexican than Tex-mex and food is closer to Fonda San Miguel than Chuys.  Atmosphere is upscale strip center.  Nice drinks  apps  and food choices.  We will be back 
Eldorado Cafe,461,Our first time here   we ordered the kid s chicken and rice taco meal   enchiladas suizas    carnitas  and some agua frescas. Chicken was very flavorful  enchiladas were okay  and carnitas were good.  The white rice and black beans that accompanied the meals were not tasty.  Rice was quite bland   it actually tasted like cardboard. The agua frescas were watered-down and definitely not worth  4 each. The portions were small for the inflated price.  We paid over  60 for lunch   We won t be coming back.
Eldorado Cafe,462,Good food don t think it s Tex mex  cooks are from Guanajuato. family Friendly environment
Eldorado Cafe,463,I ordered the Shepard s Pie and 2 -16oz salsas from the take-out menu. My picky kiddo LOVES their salsa. He puts it on everything and most importantly  eats what he puts it on  Pretty sure he would drink it  if I let him. It really is the best. When I got home I realized the salsas were smaller than ordered  8oz . This is not the worst thing ever  in the grand scheme of things  Covid-19  it s pretty minor. But  given that I needed more salsa  I called them. I explained what happened. They offered to set it straight. I went by the restaurant  parked my car  and called. It s crazy awesome how they have set up take-out orders amongst all the current chaos. Anyhow  a large bag was set on the chairs for me to pick up. I was shocked to receive an extra salsa  in addition to what was missing  and a 7 layer dip for my trouble. Things are totally crazy in the world right now  it s a small thing- but it s not. El Dorado Caf  -the food is crazy amazing good and they have a customer service to match.
Eldorado Cafe,464,Great migas plate  lots of queso on top  scrape off some if you want to keep it low cal    tortilla is toasty  Nice looking and appetizing plate for morning 
Eldorado Cafe,465,Really great place  Food was awesome I had the Joel s happy plate and it was delicious. We sat at the bar and Linda was very friendly. Seemed to be a popular place with lots of regulars. Had dog treats at the door and a seating area outside. The outdoor seating isn t full survive you have to order inside. Staff was very friendly.
Eldorado Cafe,466,Was excited to try this place. Complete let down. Everything from the drinks to entrees felt like a cheap  tasteless  watered down version of what Mexican should be. It s great that they are next to a wine bar because you would have to be drunk to think this place is good. They should be ashamed to call themselves  Chef driven.  Bad  bad  bad.
Eldorado Cafe,467,Order the ribs and carnitas  Lots of gluten free options. Super awesome  fun decor. There are tons of salsas to choose from. I liked the avocado and verde. We had great service. We ll be back on a regular basis. This is our new Tex-mex favorite 
Eldorado Cafe,468,Absolutely top-notch. Menu creative and cozy at the same time. Everything beautiful and delicious  we both had guisos hongos. Sides  salad w avocado dressing  cheesy rice  mixed potato hash. Yum  Service excellent.
Eldorado Cafe,469,Great authentic food and even better wait staff.  Great margaritas on the rocks    As small and packed as they get they never try to rush you.
Eldorado Cafe,470,My first visit. Made it in just before 11 AM on a Tuesday for breakfast hours. Excellent breakfast tacos. Beautiful presentation and the food arrived in heated dishes. Loved that. I m looking forward to trying other dishes for lunch and dinner. My server was Devon  and he was very helpful and patient answering my questions.
Eldorado Cafe,471,Got carnitas and egg bowl that had fresh avocado slices and queso fresca.  It was delicious and pork was full of flavorful and tender.  Jor got sausage and carnitas omelette.  Sopapilla cheesecake for dessert.  Grrat coffee.  Worth it for brunch up north   Now to time to go for our closing.
Eldorado Cafe,472,I got off work early on a Friday and was excited to finally be able to take advantage of the good happy hour deals here. We arrived at about 5 40 and the hostess told us the wait was 50 mins. YIKES. Before 6    Luckily 2 seats at the bar opened up  so we decided to get our happy hour margs there and order food as well.  I love that they have so many great vegetarian and even vegan options listed on the menu. And the food was fantastic. I love that you can go the traditional hot plate Tex-Mex route if you want to and get rice and beans  etc  or they also have lighter sides like roasted veggies or a side salad if you re feeling that.  My one problem was the service at the bar. The bartenders were working their butts off  but there just weren t enough of them. They could have used another set of hands. We ended up not leaving until nearly 8pm because it was almost impossible to get one of the bartenders  attention to place our order get our check  etc. There was constantly a flow of people placing drink orders and the bartenders could barely keep up. So I definitely don t blame them  but it was still a pretty big bummer to have to sit there for 2  hours.
Eldorado Cafe,473,A little too Tex mexy for my taste. And was a super bummer that you had to pay for chips and salsa. Major dinning faux pas for a Mexican restaurant.
Eldorado Cafe,474,Just had lunch here today. Excellent  Great service  staff  food  drinks. All their sauces are way above your normal Mexican Fare. Try for an early dinner  or early lunch because it gets crowded.
Eldorado Cafe,475,Great fresh food with a Tex-Mex Farm to table vibe. Any of the specials is worth ordering. Also their breakfast brunch menu is worth the wait  or just go a little early . Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable and willing to answer my dumb questions about the menu  ingredients and their favorites. The owner is always in greeting people and checking to make sure everything is great. He s one of those people who remembers everyone and actually cares so I always leave happy knowing I m supporting someone that s in it to spread the food joy.
Eldorado Cafe,476,I think we ve found our new favorite brunch place. We arrived at the recommendation of yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. The staff is so friendly  service was fast and thorough and the food was delicious. We even managed in get in a margarita which I highly recommend. We left planning our next weekend brunch trip 
Eldorado Cafe,477,I will NEVER go back to El Dorado Cafe off Anderson Lane.  After a long Church service  we called to ask what the wait was well into the lunch hour because the wait times are often ridiculous and the food while good is  imho  not THAT good.  For a party of three  I was told 15 minutes.  When we got there less than 10 minutes later  we were told the wait was 35-40 minutes for us.  When I said to the guy at the counter that I had been told just a little while before that the wait was 15 minutes  he claimed there must have been a miscommunication.  BS.  The person I spoke with VERY CLEARLY stated 15 minutes for a party of three on the phone.  UPDATE--The proprietor who responded is incorrect and misstating the facts totally to cover her staff mistake.  In fact  when I was told in person that the wait was 3 times as long as what I was told VERY CLEARLY on the phone  I explained calmly what I had been told and said no thanks and walked out.  I did place a call after leaving to be clear that o thought it was unacceptable to be told one thing VERY CLEARLY on the phone and a COMPLETELY different take within a matter of probably less than 10 minutes when walking in the store when the staff person INCREDIBLY started to act as if I was nuts for reporting what I VERY CLEARLY was told.  At that point  I of course asked to register a complaint with the manager but was put on hold for an extended period and gave up.  TERRIBLE experience with this restaurant and mutually agree that it doesn t need my dollars and I don t need its bad service attitude.  Plenty of great places nearby to spend my dollars.  I am glad this manager confirmed for me that El Dorado is to be avoided.
Eldorado Cafe,478,Enchilada Suzias are the best  the las calabasas with butternut squash  yellow squash and roasted garlic is something Unique and wonderful as a side.  5 choices of salsa and one of the smoothest quesos I ve ever had.   This place is worth finding.   Margaritas are good too.
Eldorado Cafe,479,Excellent food  awesome drinks and informative and friendly service   We came for a late lunch and will be back for brunch and dinner     We ve been back several times since the above review and are never disappointed - except maybe when there s a long wait  which there usually is on the weekends  
Eldorado Cafe,480,Not real Mexican food and the staff seemed stuck up and not willing to serve. we sat at the bar and were helped by the only bartender that wasn t even our server and was already doing everything else. He is the only reason I didn t give a one star.
Eldorado Cafe,481,Absolutely fabulous     Food  Atmosphere  Staff  Drinks  Location..... Do yourself a favor  visit and enjoy  - 
Eldorado Cafe,482,This is my favorite taco place  These are change your life tacos  Once you have these everything else will be ruined. The first time we went we were starving  Had a 30-45 minute wait. Was not happy.  Let me say  well worth the wait  I d wait an hour for this food. Now  we thought  maybe it was just amazing because we were so hungry so we went back  not disappointed  We ve had the carnitas cubanos and that s my favorite  But the mojo pollo and short ribs are also delicious. The avocado salsa  I d drink that if that wouldn t be weird.  I think once they did a crepe dessert and that I wasn t wowed by. But go here 
Eldorado Cafe,483,This is my all time fave Mexican restaurant.  No matter where you are DRIVE to it      It s amazing and the service is impeccable.  The food is absolutely amazing.
Eldorado Cafe,484,Update to my previous glowing review... I ve visited El Dorado several times since and it was a favorite.  Stopped in yesterday after being away for a couple weeks.  They must have changed their manager or cook. Come to think of it  I didn t recognize any of the original friendly wait staff.  Anyway  the food is no longer as flavorful  nor are the portions as generous. In the past  plates were served with a little guacamole  picked onions  cotija cheese  etc. No more. Mentioned that to my server and was told  Oh  we ve never.done that    Not sure what happened.
Eldorado Cafe,485,Wow. Didn t realize this new eatery was in my  hood  just off Anderson Lane and Shoal Creek. Saturday morning breakfast with a delightful new friend was made even more delightful with the delicious fare of the Eldorado Cafe. My first trip had me trying out my litmus test of a Tex-Mex breakfast - Migas    No disappointment here. Filling  cheesey  and accompanied with beans and  Fresca  salsa - as good as it gets IMHO.  The array of Austin-style breakfast tacos will attract my palate next trip here  which will be soon. Great comfortable atmosphere and a darling waitstaff.  This is a hidden  but not for long  gem.
Eldorado Cafe,486,Yes please  pulled pork tacos and gin fizz   Going back here for sure   Nice art on the walls  
Eldorado Cafe,487,For great food and service consider come here. The verde enchiladas a soooo good  And all else is great  but something that left a memory intact was those verde enchiladas.
Eldorado Cafe,488,Being located next to one of my favorite hangouts  I had high hopes. Sadly  my hopes were dashed. Bad enough that we really don t need yet another Mexican food restaurant in this town  but thisone has been a major disappointment. From the slow service  the unprofessional staff  the mediocre food  amp  the over priced menu items  I will never go back. I especially enjoyed  while waiting for my food on trip  2  hearing all about one of the servers wanting to dye her pit hair yellow . . . a real special treat.
Eldorado Cafe,489,Amazing Mexican food  Definitely a must eat restaurant if you are in North Austin. The season veggie side is awesome   Highly recommend 
Eldorado Cafe,490,Love the 5 sauces. The hot sauce is VERY hot  FYI. Nice  attentive folks work there and it s a unique twist on Mexican. So delicious  we ll be back. The only complaint is that we were a little cold in there  but other aspects of the restaurant were so great  I m not going to ding the star rating for that.
Eldorado Cafe,491,I live close by and was looking forward to trying Eldorado Cafe after watching it come together this summer  I had heard that the owner had been part of Taco Deli and I love that place  Breakfast this morning as the rain was pouring down  No wait but the place was busy   cheerful and the service was great  I had the Huevos Rancheros and ordered lettuce and tomato instead of beans and potatoes for low carb. The waitress did not skip a beat. She came back to ask if a side salad would be ok and I said  Great  . No attitude or up-charge  The eggs came on a crispy corn tortilla shell so I just slid the eggs off. The food was delish  I love their salsas  Welcome to the hood El Dorado Cafe 
Eldorado Cafe,492,Breakfast tacos were delicious. I had the migas and a pork taco  forget the name . They were sensitive  to my kid s dairy allergy. If you like heat  get the scorpion salsa.
Eldorado Cafe,493,We had an amazing dinner at Eldorado Cafe. The food was delicious - I had the carnitas. All the sides were wonderful  and I really appreciate having options for sides beyond rice and beans   Though one of us got the black beans  and they were yummy.  My margarita was great  and there wasn t too much ice  as others have commented   though I d suggest not using such big ice cubes in the mixed drinks. Everyone who works at Eldorado is so friendly and nice.   I think that the restaurant needs more people to bus tables  There was a 40 minute wait  and 6 empty tables  at one point. The servers just didn t have time to bus the tables after people left. My only other semi-negative comment is that it was pretty warm in the restaurant tonight. On a warmer day  that could be an issue.   This place has SO many gluten-free options  I love that they mark the restaurant items that  contain  gluten  because most of them do not. That s awesome    We ll be back. Thanks for great food and drinks  Eldorado Cafe 
Eldorado Cafe,494,Great breakfast. Probably the best scrambled eggs in Austin in the breakfast tacos. I don t think you can mjsorder breakfast here. Also  the horchata cold brew drink is a must.
Eldorado Cafe,495,Popped in for lunch today with my mama... love this place   The food was incredible  literally the best nachos either of us have ever had   and the enchiladas verde were delicious. Outstanding service as well  So excited to have this place in the  hood... Will most definitely be back.
Eldorado Cafe,496,We went for lunch  so I haven t yet tried their breakfast - but I will be back soon to do so    Everything was very fresh  packed with flavor  and all-around delicious. The puschkas are a delightful savory-sweet blend. For lunch I had the Enchiladas Suiza  and loved the perfect amount of spice in the verde sauce. No puddles of soupy melted cheese and salty  bland sauce here. Every flavor stood out. Shinyribs were also super yummy  And the prickly pear margarita was perfect.   I was also really impressed with how smoothly everything ran  especially given the fact that they opened less than a month ago. Servers were prompt  friendly  and attentive. And the decor is great  Can t wait to go back 
Eldorado Cafe,497,This is my favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant  it s always hopping in there  You get to pick out your salsa  we always get Salsa X  The chips are warm and not greasy. I recommend the enchiladas suizas or Rene s awesome enchiladas. There s a reason they are awesome and it s called short rib. There s also a cold brew and horchata drink which I usually get to go.   The people who work here are super happy and every time I ve been there  no matter how busy  they are always busy  the manager stops by to say hello. So good  My friend and I call Eldorado Cafe our special lunch place  hands down 
Eldorado Cafe,498,Amazing  This place opened up in our neighborhood and it is now one of our favorite spots to eat  which is considerable because there are tons of spots to eat off Anderson. We haven t had anything on the menu that we didn t like so far 
Eldorado Cafe,499,OMG All the 5 Star comments lived up to their hype. We started with something simple. If they screw it up  not coming back. Well the Migas Taco was delicioso. It was very filling and the queso on it was yummy. I just had one  and it was plenty with chips and salsa. It s very retro Mexico in dec r  you ll just have to check it out. Can t wait to go back     Hurry up next Sunday.
Eldorado Cafe,500,Called ahead for a reservation for 8 people. I was proactive but was told they don t take reservations and it won t be busy at that time. So we came in 2 cars to meet here  and I came in with 5 hungry adults and 3 hungry toddlers. The attitudes from the hostesses were very standoffish  and I was very annoyed. We live 2 minutes from here but not sure if I will visit again. Customer service is really important nowadays   and this place is lacking.
Suerte,1,This place was incredible  We ate at 2 30 on a Sunday so it was technically still considered brunch. We started with a concha and it was so soft and light and the hazelnut butter had the perfect salty sweetness. We also got the enfrijoladas and the suadero tacos. The enfrijoladas wasn t what we were expecting but was a delicious surprise. The black beans were smooth and so good. The tacos stole the show hands down though. The meat was so tender with a little crisp and so perfectly seasoned. Wrapped in a homemade tortilla  Heaven.  Our server was a total champ and walked us through the whole menu and was very attentive.  Would absolutely come back   But plan ahead and definitely get a reservation.
Suerte,2,I had been looking forward to my visit to Suerte for weeks since it took that long to get an indoor reservation. Lol   Let s start from parking. I drive an SUV and on a Tuesday evening it was pretty easy to get in the parking lot and find a spot. However getting out when there was a couple larger trucks and the back alleyway exit make for a not so fun experience. But we did it.   Once inside the vibe is very moody  lively and almost in a way sexy. It s a great date vibe but don t expect a ton of privacy cause you re right next to the guests on either side. Not a big deal since the music and atmosphere are very similar to a great party at a friend s house.   The wait staff was mostly wonderful. We had a server that was a little slow to make rounds  spilled a cup of water on my gf s jacket and overall just seemed to have a in the weeds kinda night  No deduction for that. Anyone who s waited tables has been there .   Let s talk about the food. I was excited to try some new items and was kinda surprised with the form a few things came out in versus my expectations.   We started with the eggplant sikil pak and the mushroom sopes. The eggplant is served with some in house made masa chips. The overall texture and flavor of the dip was really good but not a huge flavor there. I would have preferred more salt. The mushroom sopes were pretty disappointing. I didn t care for them at all and I love mushrooms and al pastor. If you want good al pastor just go to Rosita s Al Pastor on Riverside.   Next we moved on to the suadero tacos. They are wagyu brisket tacos that are packed with a ton of flavor. These two or three bite tacos were my absolute favorite item of the night. Honestly  worth every penny.   We also ordered the okra and shishito peppers which were really good but one of them cause my gf with a big bite of spice. We had to ask for milk cause it lit her up. She s from Iowa so not the best with spice.   For our main we sharing the Pollo Al Carbon which were pretty tasty. The corn pur e and the salsa were very tasty. There was also some nice caramels onions on there as well. The corn tortillas held up to the bite and didn t fall apart like the store bought kind. They were very good.   Finally for dessert we were gifted with the sherbet y chapulin  grasshoppers  for the spilled water and we also got the flan. This isn t like the flan you ve had at every box store Mexican restaurant. This is dense  deep caramel flavor with peach flavoring  some small diced pineapple and a sesame tuile  a round biscuit like texture . To call it just flan is an understatement. It s something special.   Overall I think it was all really great dinner but I don t know that I m motivated to go back anytime soon. I will say though I felt for the price the portions are pretty small. I felt like the service was a bit slow and not as organized as compared to other restaurants in that caliber of price.
Suerte,3,Suadero tacos. That s it. That s the reason you come here. These may be the best tacos I ve ever had. These tacos are brisket tacos with a nice avocado sauce on top. These are simple in presentation and look small  but the fattiness of the brisket and the spiciness of the sauce really fill you up. You get 4 small tacos but that s enough for one person.  We also got their fried sweet papas  sweet potatoes  which have an excellent lemon aioli base and a spicy  habanero oil on top. Absolutely delicious chunks of sweet potato   The tuna appetizer is really good. The giant crisp they put on top personally is a little overpowering from just how good the chunks of big eye tuna and avocado in a spicy and savory sauce.  Finally  make sure you get the barbacoa plate. This is beautifully cooked goat in a banana leaf with tortillas and toppings for tacos on the side. It s so flavorful and delicious   The meal was an incredible experience from start to finish and I highly recommend this for those in Austin.
Suerte,4,Favorite meal of our Austin trip  Suerte is a beautiful farm-to-table restaurant that serves up modern Mexican-inspired dishes with local ingredients. Definitely make reservations if possible - it can easily get crowded even on weekdays.  Every dish we tried was so flavorful  but if you have to choose at least one  the Suadero tacos are a MUST. The confit wagyu brisket is so incredibly juicy and tender  and it s topped with a fragrant  black magic oil   black sesame  garlic  chile oil mix   and a refreshing avocado crudo to balance it all out. Although a bit pricey  it was worth the hype   Service was friendly and helpful all around  and they even brought out a candle for a birthday dessert at our table. So sweet of them and the small gesture made our experience all the more memorable. Can t wait to return again to try their other seasonal dishes 
Suerte,5,Great spot to celebrate with good friends   Appetizer  The guacamole con macha verde is very simplistic in flavor  but I would recommend the eggplant silik pak over the guac  Both are phenomenal  but I enjoyed the eggplant a smidge more   Main   A MUST  Suadero taco  5 5   a must taco eat  It may not seem like too much food  but it is still quite filling  The beef is cooked extremely well and the tortilla is perfectly soft   Sweet papas  a nice appetizer-esque meal  A bit more heat than expected  but a great rendition of sweet potatoes   Conejo y segueza  first time having rabbit shoulder and it did not disappoint  Similar taste to chicken and very flavorful   Great environment  picture-esque   Tip well  The service is extremely kind    Cheers
Suerte,6,Suerte reminds me of Nixta  except if they didn t just do tacos. There s a non-traditional approach to the ingredients  and there s a bit of thought behind each dish.  I got the Suadero Tacos and the Tamal Verde. The Suadero is one of the most popular things to order. It s very good  you can distinctly taste each ingredient and the corn tortillas are quite hefty to boot  no falling apart on you at Suerte  no sir. Personally  I felt the dollop of avocado crudo was a bit too large a portion  it kind of overwhelmed the rest of the taco  but none-the-less very refreshing and doesn t  get old   especially since I had all 4 tacos to myself .  The Tamal Verde was very interesting. I would say the two words that come to mind are spicy and herbaceous. The basil pesto-yness really brings to mind a garden-freshness to it  I almost want to pair it against something unctuous  like pork belly. Definitely the most interesting tamal that I ve ever had.  I sat at the bar on a Tuesday  because despite walking in at 5 45pm  the wait for a table for just 1 person was still an hour  The bar s wait was 5 minutes. On a Tuesday  Wow. Service was good in the beginning but then it was really hard to get the attention of my waiter after I got both dishes. There s quite a lot of front-of-house staff and yet my waiter was balancing multiple roles and sometimes I d see other staff standing around chatting or checking their phone.  Prices are a bit high  and it seems service is hit or miss  but there s plenty on the menu to justify coming to Suerte again.
Suerte,7,Short hit  must try   Being half-Mexican  it s so refreshing to find a place that takes their masa seriously. While on the pricier side  everything here is fresh  deicious  and mostly authentic.   Beginning with their drinks  Suerte has an excellent cocktail program. I consider myself an accomplished  amateur mixologist  so I am admittedly hard to impress when it comes to drinks. I ordered the Rosa Peligrosa which was awesome   Food  regardless of what else you get  the table must get an order of the suadero tacos. Legit  some of the best tacos I ve ever had. Suadero is essentially brisket  and the meat just melts in your mouth. 10 10 dish. I ve sampled a couple of other dishes  and they have always come out flavorful and fresh.  Ambiance  modern and clearn. Great for date night or a business meal. True to its Austin roots  it s very laid back with an ecclectic clientale.   Value  as mentioned earlier  this is definitely on the higher side for Mexican food  but it s not overpriced  the price is commensurate to the quality.  Overall  this is definitely one of my must-try recommendations for anyone visiting Austin.
Suerte,8,Suerte- thank you  thank you  thank you  I wanted to take my CEO and his wife to a phenomenal restaurant in Austin and Suerte has been on my list and did not disappoint  It is challenging to get a reservation but come in before 6 and it ll be easier to get a table. Shoutout to our excellent server Rachel  You went above and beyond in treating us like VIP  Now  to the food...started with the Ceviche Suerte and Grilled Sweet Papas  then choose Suadero Tacos and goat Barbacoa. We ended with the delicious Tres Leches dessert. The cocktails were great. Everything just came together and it was a spectacular evening.
Suerte,9,Absolutely delicious dinner  Amazing gluten free and dairy free options- our server McKinsley  sorry if misspelled   was amazing at accommodating our needs  providing great suggestions  and blessing us with overall kind vibes     Quite literally every dish we had was so flavorful and tasty. Most dishes did have a bit of a kick but for us it just added to the full flavor. The Don Dario cocktail was also a tasty margarita with their house rim seasoning.  The patio seating was pleasant as you can do some people watching as you eat. Overall this was a very cute dinner spot in a bustling part of town and I d love to go back again.
Suerte,10,Wow.  I have been to Surete twice now and each time has been great.  The service  food  atmosphere  details.  They get it ALL right.  They have become one of my favorite restaurants in Austin.  It is easily at the top when people ask me   Where should I eat   here.  It s in a pretty busy part of east 6th in downtown.  They re always busy.  But even with that  I was able to get in with my group of 6 friends on a Saturday night.    We were sat at one of the round tables which made family sharing the plates so much easier.  Our server was amazing.  She gave recs where needed and was just attentive but not overbearing.  Her name was Arielle and I would ask for her again in a second.  We got so many items  too many to list here  but I ll say  get the guac and get the suadero tacos.  They are so damn good.  Everything is A1.  They even brought us a fourth free dessert which was so sweet.  I got an after dinner drink m y m  which was mezcal and Montenegro   wow.  It was so good.  I ll definitely be making that at home.  It s just a must.  You must go.  If there was one restaurant I was asked about in Austin right now  the answer would be Suerte.... and also their sister restaurant they just opened named Este.
Suerte,11,Came here last week and it s consistently delicious. Here s a few snapshots before we inhaled our food  Suarte is a must when you live in or visiting ATX.   Also I want to add the staff  is wonderful and accommodating-  our reservation was at 12 15  peak of brunch  and the place was slammed  we started out with a table for six and at check-in  amp  our party of six morphed into three adults and one kid within 5 mins time.. They were so understanding and got us seated and taken care of with out a problem and a smile on their face .
Suerte,12,Hands down some of the most amazing food I ve ever had. Every single dish we ordered was mouth watering and full of flavor. If I could give Suerte more than 5 stars I 100  would.  I recommend getting a reservation if you can. The Suadero tacos are a MUST.  You really can t go wrong with anything on the menu. Wait staff super friendly and helpful.  Will be back 1000000 
Suerte,13,Man I d give this place 10 stars if I could   We couldn t get a reservation  but we came at 5 pm when they opened and got sat immediately. For our appetizer  we ordered the pulpo tostada. The pulpo was cooked perfectly. Had the right amount of tenderness.   We weren t sure what to order  but we ended up getting the carne asada as our meal. Oh my goodness-everything on that plate was so good. It s an oaked grilled wagyu bavette with charred fresno butter  beef tallow black beans  pearl onions  and freshly made corn tortillas. These were the best corn tortillas I ve ever had. I layered on a spoonful of beans with some bavette and topped it off with the pearl onions and it was a flavor explosion in your mouth.   The table next to us ordered the suadero tacos  confit wagyu brisket  black magic oil  avocado crudo  onions and cilantro. We were worried we wouldn t be able to finish a full order  4 tacos  so our waiter said we could order a half order of 2 tacos  We ended up doing that and I m so glad we did cause it was another flavor explosion in your mouth  The brisket was so tender and with the black magic oil and avocado crudo...the umami was insane.   For dessert  we ordered the flan. It was so thick and was topped with a delicious peach topping and a sesame tuile.10 stars for the meal  The service was excellent and we would def come back here our next visit to Austin 
Suerte,14,Amazing experience  Everything we had was one of a kind taste  I wish I had their recipes.   The beet dish  such unique taste with caramel    The tacos  with the waygu meat and black truffle oil  I am sorry abeula  but you got some competition on the flan  their flan was so unique  I think it has rice honey  Really blew my mind.   Def earned the spot for best restaurant in Austin in my rankings 
Suerte,15,Lucky snag of a walk-in with about 10 minutes of wait  but a reservation would guarantee you a spot.  Menus are via QR code - which means you can view them on the website.  Great idea if you re looking to plan your meal in advance so you can get in and get eating.  They do like having all the ordering up front so they can help course it out.  Atmosphere was lively but it wasn t crazy loud. Seating is a mixture of tables and booths with bar height tables near the front of the restaurant.   Really enjoyed the food - but word of warning . . . so much masa   corn flavors throughout the whole night.  Even though some of the dishes may look a little light - everything is remarkably filling  so this really isn t a place for a light meal .    Here s what we tried   Beverages  Yaupon Spritz - light drink  vodka  strawberry  yaupon tea  aloe  cava .  Not terribly sweet and very refreshing.  This one is really easy to drink Carajito - boozy coffee   Food  Frijoles Envenenados - smoothly decadent refried beans with some chorizo bacon and a few semi whole beans for a contrast of flavor and texture  slight bit of spice on this one .  served with some house made corn chips about the size of your face.    Pulpo Tostada - blue corn    tostada about the size of a hand generously topped with cabbage a pineapple pico  an adobo roja and tender bites of grilled octopus.  Flavors are nice on this one without being overwhelming - a very nice starter.  Pachucos - two pork picadillo stuffed corn empanadas fried perfectly with some summer corn salsa.  These are roughly the size of a hand pie. The corn has a rich sweet taste.  Would love to have had a bit more flavor with the pork  but the corn salsa really ties this thing together.  I would think this would reheat well in an air fryer or toaster oven.  Suadero Tacos - housemade corn tortillas the size of a coaster and about the same thickness  like 2-3mm .  Has some great elasticity to it.  Topped with confit wagyu brisket  black magic oil and an avocado crudo onion cilantro mix.  Unctuously rich brisket really goes nicely with the crudo and onions  acidity cuts the fat nicely .  This sucker is a three bite.  We asked for a little of their habanero sauce to go with this  heat takes a tick to come in but it s got kick .    Pollo Al Carbon - smoked chicken thighs  toasted corn puree with a tomatillo salsa and housemade tortillas. This was the last dish of the night and though ready to toss in the towel  we still mustered enough strength to barrel through half the dish.  The corn puree added some nice sweetness against the smokiness of the chicken.  Seemingly a simple straightforward dish  but had just solid flavors.
Suerte,16,I had an amazing birthday dinner at Suerte. Reservations are a little hard to come by so make sure they are made well in advance. They are opened up 30 days in advance and fill up in a couple days. The service is impeccable. Our waiter San Juan was so helpful and descriptive when giving us recommendations. We loved how every dish was different than anything we ve ever had but the stand outs were the Eggplant Sikil Pak and the Beet Huarache. The ambiance was perfect. It wasn t too loud and the dividers between cubes offered enough privacy while still giving an open airy concept when standing.
Suerte,17,DANK MEAL. I am giving this place 5 stars solely for the ceviche. We got chips   guac   queso   salsa to share. the chips are gigantic and the experience of eating them together is better than the taste.  CEVICHE SUERTE  christ  this was bomb. very different than regular ceviche  larger cuts and less limey. 10 10 TUNA NEGRA TIRADITO  Good  but not as good as the ceviche  QUESADILLA CON CALABAZA  a nice quesadilla  overall  stellar service  good drinks  great atmosphere  and good food  
Suerte,18,Excellent service  relaxing and elegant ambiance  creative presentation and delicious food - what more can a birthday girl ask for   San Juan was our server but every person who brought out a dish for us was knowledgeable and friendly. San Juan had a particular passion for the food.   I m vegetarian and gluten-free - I enjoyed the coco y melon immensely. And the cucumber ceviche.   The empanada was excellent as well.   The earthiness of the decor created a relaxing brunch atmosphere.
Suerte,19,I m so impressed by Suerte. Hands down  the best restaurant I visited in Austin. It s in a cute area of East Austin  and the interiors are stunning. The lighting  the bar seating  the earthy tones  and flower decor. It was a whole experience just being in the restaurant. Our server recommended the concha which I m so glad he did because it was divine. The creamy and salted almond butter with the buttery dough and chai-flavored shell. Chefs kiss   Horchata is absolutely the BEST here. I ve had my fair share with horchatas but Suerte just does it right. The coconut milk flavor really comes through and the cinnamon adds that nice kick  It is so delightful and highly recommend. Food surpassed my expectations for Tex Mex food. The tortillas are the perfect texture and flavor and the beef on the Suadero tacos were SO juicy and tender. Portions are filling and worth the price 
Suerte,20,Was seated suuuuper late for my highly anticipated 8pm reservation. Drinks came late too. But I m giving stars for Ariel our server and for the tacos. Small portion but the brisket was delicious. I also really enjoyed the black magic oil and the sweet potatoes. I had a Tequila flight  or 2.....    I mean I couldn t help it- tequila and mezcal pours are half off on Mondays   
Suerte,21,Suerte  My Suerte experience was fantastic.  I came in on a Thursday evening  around 5 45pm. I didn t have a resy so I was prepared to wait but they were able to seat us right away.  The waitress walked us through the menu and provided some fantastic context around items that are seasonal and some that are unique as well. All recommendations were fantastic   The highlights  - Eggplant Sikil Pak - Molotes - Tres Leches  The rest  still amazing   - Suadero Tacos - Ceviche Suerte  Overall incredible - from the start to end of the meal the dishes kept hitting.  The eggplant Sikil Pak was such a unique and flavorful spread - must try. It was sooo good. The Tres Leches was massive  creamy  moist and to die for.  The molotes were super comforting and the  salad  that was paired with was light  spicy  and impeccable.  The suadero tacos were so good but they were very rich with flavor  almost a little too much  and heavy. I had two tacos and this was more then enough  the order comes with 4 tacos .  Can t wait to come back and try more of the menu   Cheers  
Suerte,22,Definitely check this place out. Be sure to make a reservation ahead of time because it fills up   My friends and I tried a few cocktails and thought they were pretty good  but not so outstanding. The food  however  was SO tasty  Although on the pricier side  I would definitely go back for the food  ideally for happy hour  lucky hour as they call it .  We tried the ceviche and that is a must if you life seafood. The suadero tacos are a must for EVERYONE. They come as 3 small tacos  so I recommend sharing so everyone gets a taste  I m excited to check out this place again and try other items on the menu  but I ll get the suadero tacos again in addition 
Suerte,23,So I ve been hearing about Suerte for a while and was finally able to secure a reservation.  It s definitely a high end restaurant where your glass is always filled and you actually have great service.  The food was good but maybe I m just not a fan of Mexican food cause I don t think it s that great.  I thought the brisket tacos and barbocoa was too salty for my taste.  The only flavor profile I seem to experience was salt.  The drinks I really enjoyed but this was not a cocktail bar so I can t judge it solely in cocktails.  The eggplant dip may actually taste better than the two taco dishes since there were more flavor profile than just salt.  Overall  I d say it s probably a great place if you like Mexican food and want to have an enjoyable dinner.  Also great place for a date.
Suerte,24,The dining experience at Suerte was top notch  Family style is a must  there s so many amazing dishes to try on the menu. We started off the meal with drinks. I got the pep talk which was very smoky  sweet with an almost savory edge. Next was the eggplant sikil pak  a delicious eggplant dip that was light and refreshing. I also tried the beet huarache  which was warm and hearty. I tried two of their taco dishes  the suadero tacos and the conejo y segueza. The meat was super tender for both  the conejo had just the right amount of spicy kick. The corn tortilla was super fresh as well. The service was absolutely amazing  our server described each dish in a way that made me anticipate the food even more. Overall a great place for an upscale dining experience 
Suerte,25,I m so happy I got to try suerte.   I was truly impressed with everything    The vibes - homey  clean and modern. Loved the decor   Service  STELLAR   The drinks - I had the Baja brr-o with the rum floater  and it had a wonderful passion fruit flavor. Normally I dont go for frozen drinks but this was the exception. I think the rum floater is needed though   We had the calabaza dip and oh my squash it was something that hummus could never. And I love hummus.  The saudero tacos 10 10 - it had all the flavor profiles I love  salt fat acid and heat    Pollo Al cabron - like I ve mentioned in other reviews  chicken isn t my fav protein but I was impressed with the char on the chicken and how it was still so juicy  The carne asada - tender  but I think the star of the plate was the black bean pur e. I ALMOST licked the plate but I was in front of coworkers   We felt we should have some veggies so we got the grilled zanahorias  carrots  and I was pretty impressed the way they prepared it. It was tender with a savory sweet flavor   We got the cascara for dessert and it was a perfect light accompaniment to finish off the night.  It s slightly more on the expensive side but I do believe it was worth it.
Suerte,26,Incredible  Simply Incredible. As a foodie this is a top 10. The Smoked Salmon Tostada was a fantastic collision of flavors   The Chilaquiles Verde was a top two ever for me.  Enjoy
Suerte,27,This place is fire. On the fancier side. A total vibe with a group of friends since everything is so shareable. Bummer that happy hours are not available on Fridays.
Suerte,28,Suerte  Meaning luck in spanish  and appropriately so. If you manage to land a reservation here for a party you certainly are lucky  and that luck is well spent. Top notch service and great food  this is a venture worth trying to go for.  Atmosphere  Contemporary Austin restaurant type vibe  meaning clean but hip  has a welcoming homely type which is perfect for get togethers with friends or even flying solo.  Food  Mexican food lovers rejoice  this is the great pilgrimage that you must undertake. Suerte prides themselves in their dishes made with Masa  which is essentially corn dough  but rightfully so because all their dishes that come with Masa are such standouts that you can really taste and appreciate the effort put into making them. Notable favorites being Frijoles Envenendaos  Suadero  and the quesadilla.  Frijoles Envenendaos  ironically meaning poisoned beans  but no poison here    is a great starter with a tasty twist to chips and bean dip. At first I was hesitant to get the Suadero given it s a taco with wagyu in it and I was afraid for the portion size  but all more worries were alleviated when the dish came out and there was plenty to share with my party  on top of course being a great take on a beef taco that was just melt in your mouth delicious.   Service  Ultra friendly and attentive. Our server Jonathan made sure that all our questions were answered and consistently made sure that our drinks were filled and that our plates were cleaned with each course. Small things like cleaning off the table after each meal really added to the charm of the service this place offered  ensuring that they really wanted you to enjoy the dish to it s fullest.   Easily one of the best places I ve had in Austin that really captures the vibe of the city and standouts amongst the crowd. Suerte again lives up to its namesake  and I cannot wait to return to try their other items.
Suerte,29,I can see why this is one of the best rated restaurants in Austin. Everything we tried was amazing. The eggplant dip is unlike any other. Smoky  and earthy with a hint of lime. The beet tacos was a burst of flavor. Smoky  spicy and herby. The pescado verde is fish wrapped in leaf. The flavors of the leaf and verde sauce go so well with the buttery fish. Finally the suadero tacos is a favorite. Perfect balance of tender meat and avocado on a soft corn taco. We ll be back to explore more items from their menu.
Suerte,30,It was a nice dinner   We came in on a Monday night  it was crowded but we were lucky to get a table right away.  The menu was not friendly for non-spanish speaking customers since we spent a long time googling every word and even then it was not telling much. The menu feels like they were trying too hard to make it seem authentic... I was a bit annoyed by it tbh.  Our server was super nice  so that was helpful.  Food was pretty good  I like the chips alot  It has spice in it so it tasted smoky. Fish was really good  but I think it could use more herbs to create more flavors. The tres leches was great  It has a malty taste to the cream so it was super comforting    Will recommend it for people who want to have a nice dinner.
Suerte,31,Excellent food  Service was great. We had some food restrictions and they are very accommodating. Our waitress recommended dishes that were delicious made with very fresh ingredients. We sat in the patio area on a cold day but their heaters did their magic.
Suerte,32,Suerte has been a bucket list restaurant for me for the last two years and I felt very fortunate to grab a last minute reservation for my birthday 5 days prior.   I just want to say this was one of the best meals of my entire life. Top 5 meals I ve ever had    We showed up for our 10 30pm reservation ready to go all in. Our waitress  I believe her name was Edna   was 5 star. She was super welcoming nice and patient and excited to guide us through the menu knowing we wanted pretty much everything lol. Bless her    The Pulpo Tostada was an excellent way to start. Chilled and perfectly cooked octopus on a homemade tostada paired with excellent sauces. The Molotes omg who knew a crispy potato dumpling filled with cheese and whitefish could taste so airy light and perfectly balanced. The Suadero tacos were the real reason why we were there and frankly for how unassuming they looked  easily hands down the best taco experience of my entire life. I ll die on this hill lol. But the leaf wrapped Barbacoa served with the perfect accoutrements might have also stolen the show  Our waitress suggested it was time to cleanse our palate  so she brought out the Peaches y Feta and omg it certainly was. Almost ice cold peaches with feta and a basil dressing  I was ready for round 2 after that  So now here s comes this smoky crispy grilled Pollo Al Carbon and I was just in hog heaven  And for the final course  the Pescado a la Veracruzana  monkfish  was just perfectly and exceptionally cooked in this refreshing tomato broth. Chef s kiss perfection.   I don t know how we had room in our bellies for dessert but we ordered the Tres Leches and this sleeper dessert called Cascara which was an omg seductive eyes rolling into the back of my head textural roller coaster experience. You have to order this dessert   All in all I will come back again and again and again til I die. Thank you Suerte for making my birthday super memorable 
Suerte,33,Dishes were hit or miss  very binary .The octopus was fantastic   The sweet potato felt like something I could find anywhere .   The Blondie with butternut squash dessert was incredible   The red snapper taquito was too oily and lacked something to make it memorable.    But overall  food does feel authentic.  Our server was uninterested and hardly even described the dishes until we forced him to .
Suerte,34,Calling all taco lovers  Saw this restaurant on Netflix as I was watching Taco chronicles all taco stands were in Mexico City except for Suerte. Highly recommended you taking a day trip to Austin TX be ready to indulge in mouth watering flavors as they explode in your mouth. Location has a parking lot  Indoor or outdoor seating  Ambiente is chill staff helping each other out. The music playing is all in Espa ol that was a plus for me ro   at and dine in my Culture.
Suerte,35,This was on my list of must-try restaurants while visiting Austin for work.  Suerte takes online reservations  however  when I checked the morning of the day we wanted to eat there  the earliest available for five was over a week out.  We decided to take a chance at walking in and arrived on a Monday night around 6 00 PM.  An outdoor table was available and we were promptly seated.  Our server  Lyle  came by shortly after to take drink orders and asked if it was our first time at the restaurant.  He was super cool and helpful with our menu selections.  I had the Nada Paloma cocktail and it was refreshing.  We decided to do family style with the menu and since many of the dishes came with four pieces  Lyle was kind enough to add an additional piece  for a slight surcharge  for each order.  Frijoles envenenados - bean dip with their homemade chips  Ceviche suerte - light and full of flavor Molotes - bite-sized dumplings Quesadilla de res - came in one large piece that we cut up  Suadero tacos - the best dish of the night  Tamal zurita - the tamale was perfect texture  the mole sauce was average  Desserts  cascara and fresas con cream - both were good and the ideal way to end the meal  Suerte has their own parking lot and there is some street parking available.  Will definitely return the next time I m in Austin 
Suerte,36,I am not a fan of Tex-Mex Food  and it is a struggle to find a nice just Mexican food. If you are like me  it is your lucky day because you found your place.   Suerte is Traditional Mexican cuisine with modern flair. It deserves a Michelin Star just for the their version of Suedero Tacos. It is a genius to use Wagyu. The oil on this taco is magical.   What makes it better their home made corn tortillas. If you close your eyes  you will think you are in Oaxaca.   What to order everything in the menu  but if it your first time  The Suedero tacos  You will thank me later 
Suerte,37,I love the creative and innovative strategies that this restaurant successfully pulls off.  On Tuesday  August 2  2022  Suerte hosted another in their  Taquero Takeover series.  This event featuring Chef Dylan Salisburyof Tatsu-Yu provided charitable proceeds directed to Austin Pets Alive.    This was a successful and fun event--the restaurant was packed and there was terrific energy in the house.   We enjoyed Pulpo Tostada  grilled octopus  adobo rojo  pineapple pico  cabbage and herb crema  and Guacamole Con Matcha Verde and Smoked Kalua Pork Tacos  smoked kalua pork  tiki XO  chicharron furikake  avocado salsa .  These dishes paired well together and were expertly conceived and executed.  What a fun evening.  Thank you  Suerte  for your creativity and risk-taking.
Suerte,38,We tried this place out for brunch and were not disappointed.  The service was great and the food was pretty good.  The serving sizes were kind of small for the price and we spent way more than we anticipated just to feel full.  Some of the dishes were definitely better than others  and I would say that the food is not everyone s cup of tea.  All in all the experience was good.   I would definitely like to check this place out for dinner.
Suerte,39,This place was phenomenal and the lentil bean dish alone made this place a 5 star in my book. Set on a great street where you can mosey down to drinks by walking less than 50 feet away or you can go up and down 6th street for more choices.   The interior was absolutely lovely with a rustic and neutral color that made it feel light and airy. The service was top notch. They did a great job describing the menu and their recommendations were all delicious.   We got delicious cocktails and the lentils again were a dish that I will lament not being able to eat daily  The wagyu tacos were delicious and so were the shared goat barbacoa tacos dish 
Suerte,40,Cute ambiance   deliciously fresh flavors   incredibly kind service  This is definitely a better place for a group for more opportunities to share plates and split the pricey options  but the farm-to-table creations are worth every penny. The flavors are fresh  light and yummy. Will definitely come back    As a vegetarian  there are less options but everything I had was still satisfying.
Suerte,41,Every dish was a winner for us. Awesome take on traditional Mexican food with amazing cocktails. Best of all the service was incomparable. From amazing recommendations to the attentiveness from the team. They even provided us with great  local approved  activities to check out while in town.   This is an absolute must visit while in Austin and I cannot wait to go back to try everything I didn t order.   Highly recommend  - Suadero Tacos - Aguachile - Tamales  - Refried Lentils - Flan
Suerte,42,I d like to start this review by HIGHLY suggesting that you make reservations. We waited 2 hours but it was beyond worth the wait.   We sat at the bar and I really wish I got our servers name because he was incredible   He had glasses and a bun  if you re reading this thank you again for your exceptional service.  He was so nice and patient enough to explain everything to us. Suerte is considered modern Mexican with farm to table and that s exactly what we got. I can t say enough good things.  Onto what we ate  drank   Don Dario  most popular drink on the menu . Their take on a margarita. It was 10 10 amazing. My boyfriend that rarely ever drinks tequila even loved it.   Frijoles Envenenados  comes with these giant house made chips. This was so good and gooey. The chips were so crunchy combined with the dip   best combination ever.   Suadero tacos  I m sorry but confit wagu brisket with house tortillas  Must I say more  The correct answer is no but I will anyways. The tortillas were the best I ve ever had  soft and fluffy. The brisket practically melted in your mouth with a bit of heat but nothing unbearable. And the avocado crudo and onions created the texture. This is also great to share but after having a bite you may not want to    Lastly our favorite thing of the night and if you re only going to order 1 thing this should be it  Au Poivre a la Mexicana  comes with tortillas and this insane crispy potatoes. Again the ribeye melted in your mouth and the sauce is comes in was outrages. We even told our server that this dish should be the only thing they serve because it was just that good. Compliments to the Chef   Hands down one of my favorite places and will definitely be returning. Just next time with a reservation 
Suerte,43,We walked in on a Friday night at 6 pm and were able to get seated immediately outside on the patio  rain was forecasted but held off which may explain the availability . Staff was awesome and attention to detail was 10 10  napkins folded every time we went to the bathroom  for ex .   The food   We got the lentil dip  pictured . This was my least fav thing because the chips seemed quite stale. The dip was delicious though.   The tacos.... Guys get the tacos  Amazing.   The chicken- fatty for my taste but my sig other loved it   The potatoes- delicious but some bites were super spicy   Drinks- i had the mezcal egg white drink  also pictured  which was really good- not TOO sweet. My sig other had the margarita and loved it    Overall great food and experience
Suerte,44,This place is awesome. They do the food family style and it tastes great. We got 4 dishes for four people and it was just enough.  We had the guacamole that had just the right amount of spice. We had  Quail  chicken thighs   Goat Barbacoa and carrots.
Suerte,45,Hands down some of the best food and drinks I ve ever had.  Pros  food  service  everything  Cons  I could see how this atmosphere may not appeal to everyone  Let me start with the cons because the pros are numerous. -The atmosphere is casual yet upscale  if there was a picture of gentrified Mexican Millenial opulence  this would be it -Obviously this means it s a pricey experience  I would budget  100 person for a good experience  -Portions are also diminished  but not to the extent where you will still be hungry or feel your money wasn t worth it  Onto the Pros We were in a group of six and needed to make a reservation a couple of weeks ahead of time. Strongly advise to do this.  When we got there  the hostesses were friendly and asked us to wait until our entire party arrived. A couple people got some drinks while we waited.  Once we were seated  we scanned the QR code for the menu and we were off on our food adventure.  For appetizers  we ordered   GUACAMOLE CON MACHA VERDE - incredibly smooth and was gone instantly  CALABAZA DIP - a pleasantly robust flavor that brought us back to our childhood as it reminded us of corn nuts  CEVICHE SUERTE - definitely not ceviche as I was expecting  more of sashimi with  pico  dish  but didn t make it any less delicious  We decided to share a couple main dishes  SUADERO TACOS - the STAR of Suerte. Personally  I have only experienced a dish like this one other time  and this gave me an emotional reaction to the epicness that is this taco. The meat was incredibly tender  yet had a some pieces charred  the fattiness of the meat was cut by the guacamole. Overall  an incredibly balanced bite of food with mind-blowing flavor.  I m salivating as I type this three days later   POLLO AL CARBON - a blackened chicken with some spice and zest. Very good  but was  relatively  a little tougher to eat  not as tender   ENSALADA DE EJOTE - this was the only dish that didn t stand out to me. It was good  but I personally don t enjoy long beans that seemed to be blanched.  Moving on to the drinks  Our party order multiples of the Soraya  Pep Talk  and Rosa Peligrosa. All delicious and would order again.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Couldn t give them any higher praise.  All in all  if you have the money to eat here  I highly recommend it.
Suerte,46,We sat at the bar  which is our favorite place to sit if it s just the two of us.  We started with delicious cocktails Nada Paloma  amp  the Don Dario  both were fabulous   Next we got the frijoles envenenados which was   chorizo-bacon fried pinto beans  guajiro chile  que sill o  and tostadas to eat it with.  omg it was amazing       We then ordered the ceviche de coco which was cured shrimp  spiced coconut milk  onion relish charred orange  avocado  amp  macadamia. Oh  and another don dario  goes down way to easy .  The care that went into making that dish was amazing     Lastly  we got the quesadilla de res which was a smoked wagyu short rib with cheese  rajas and a charred grapefruit salsa.  Holy cow it was fantastic     We were stuffed when we left  amp  our tummies were oh so happy   Hans the manager was awesome   They were really busy at the bar so he came over to start us until the bartender was able to take over.  I told him about my food allergy and he went and basically gave me my own special menu    Way to go above and beyond Hans      Mario was our bartender waiter  amp  he was awesome as well.  We highly recommend Suerte  When we re back in Austin  we will go back    
Suerte,47,Exceptional food that truly lives up to the hype. Please don t miss the shishito peppers and okra - it was our favorite dish next to the suadero tacos.
Suerte,48,O.M.G. The yogurt is 15 10. We were on the fence about the yogurt initially but the bartender said he s never tasted anything like it which was intriguing and after the first spoonful of the yogurt I cannot agree with him more - it s a delightful taste of summer with the richness from the roasted pistachios and the rum raisins plus the spike of flavor profile of mint and basil. The suadero tacos are the signature items and the portion is actually pretty decent for two people. We also ordered the quesadilla but it didn t meet the expectation in terms of presentation and taste unfortunately. Although we didn t order any cocktails but was able to sit at the bar and all the drinks looked super delicious and fun for brunch    
Suerte,49,If I were just rating the suedaro tacos it would be 5 stars -- best tacos outside of Mexico  We also really enjoyed the horchata -- super creamy texture.   The other dishes were good but not mind blowing -- got the tamales  frijole dip  and squash. I did not care for the squash but my husband did.   We came here around 6pm or so on a Friday night without a reservation. The wait was 45 minutes -- you put your name down and they text you when your table is ready. They sat us at the bar.
Suerte,50,Oh man real wagyu and not the fake stuff  We wanted to come here for awhile but after seeing Suerte featured on Netflix s Taco Chronicles and found out they used wagyu beef. We got the wagyu tacos and wagyu quesadilla if you had to choose one I would go with the quesadilla it was cheesy  fatty  more flavorful   Also recommended is the ceviche    Portion sizes were a bit small definitely can rack up the bill pretty easily here 
Suerte,51,This place reminds me of one of my old favorites back in LA. I had a simple dinner of the Suadero Tacos which are confit wagyu brisket  black magic oil  avocado crudo  and onion y cilantro  and a few of their Don Dario cocktails. The tacos were amazing  perfectly flavored and just the right portion with 4 small tacos. The drink is perfect as well -- flavorful  similar to a margarita. I highly recommend this place and will be back on my next visit.
Suerte,52,If you love meat and Mexican food  this is for you. There is street parking and they also have a private parking lot   on the left when facing the restaurant . The entrance is located by the private parking lot Place is nice although i do agree with some of the reviews that it is a little crowded. In general we loved our experience. They recommend about two plates  dish per person. For the cold plate we got the octopus or pulpo tostada. It has little heat so be careful if you are not a fan of spicy food. Octopus was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great. The suadero tacos was highly recommend. Per server that is the only part of the menu that has not changed. It is very flavorful. It s a little oily for me but the taste was worth all the fat  Au Poivre Mexicana is basically a steak dish. Sooo good. We were worried that it was going to be too much since it s just the two of us and we had some other food but it really wasn t. It comes with a yummy sauce  tortilla and crispy potatoes. We have a 5 year old with us so for her they prepared a plain cheese quesadilla with guacamole on the side.   Their cocktails are also good. We are not a fan of mezcal but for their cocktails  it works. My favorite is the Sano Poblano. It is very refreshing and perfect for the summertime
Suerte,53,FANSTASTACO    This is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants I ve ever been to.   It is very simple  because of the pandemic they have their menu so that it is connected with a QR code. So all you have to do is scan the QR code and you are on your way. The menu has a variety of items from small plates to full on meals. You will not be disappointed.   The atmosphere was outstanding. We sat outside. There is an outside patio with a tent. The tent is not your ordinary tent. It is set up so  there can be roughly 4 to 5 picnic style tables underneath it. It is very spread out so you won t be on top of another party if you choose to sit outside.   The inside was nice too. There was a full tequila bar and tons of tables. The decor is very chic. It looks very ritzy inside.   The food was exceptional. We decided to get three different thing and split then between three people. That was the way to go with this restaurant as the portion sizes can be big. We started with an appetizer of chips and guacamole. The chips were not normal chips you could find anywhere. They are big chips and you break them up to share with the people at your table. The guacamole was very good too it had a bit of a kick to it  so be warned.   As far as entrees go  We got the tostada  the Azul quesadilla and the signature tacos. All were delicious. The tostadas were covered with a blanco sauce. They had corn and other crunchy ingredients inside. And the top was sprinkled with black pepper which helped to bring out the flavors even more.   The signature tacos were very cute and the display of them was wonderful. The dish came with four small soft shelled tacos that were made in house. They had wagu beef in them as well as a spicy green sauce too. I was not prepared for the spicy kick and found myself sitting there with my tongue sweating.   Azul quesadilla was a very interesting concept. I have never sees a quesadilla blue in color. The inside was very appetizing there was cheese and some kind of poultry but I m not quite sure which it was but it was super delicious. The dish came with three different types of condiments. But like o said I m not the biggest fan of spice. So that was a no for me but I did squeeze some line on top of my half of the quesadilla and was happy as a clam.   The spritz beverage was very interesting as well. It had guava juice and vodka and cava too. As a virgin to the flavor of guava and cava  the flavors worked so well together and it had a carbonation in it too which made it a little easier in my opinion to drink. But it is definitely one of those drinks you don t expect to be that good and might over look it.   At the end of our meal we ordered the pink cake. The waiter told us that the cake came with house-made sprinkles. Sprinkles that take about 2-3 days to make. I have never heard of such thing. House made sprinkles  Who knew   The cake was moist and delicious. It had layers of strawberry filling between a few layers of white sponge like cake. On top there was a strawberry guava icing but the icing layer was very thin and then they topped it off with the homemade sprinkles. It was simply delectable.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes Mexican food with a bit of a twist. It was something that you do not see everywhere. Just be wary about the portion sizes of some of the bigger entrees. But I would definitely come back 
Suerte,54,High end Mexican dining experience at a local s favorite spot. Cocktails were amazing as well as their other dishes such as the ceviche and chocotaco which they have proudly served post the announcement of the childhood favorite discontinuing. The black oil short rib tacos are a crowd favorite -- they are definitely rich tacos served on the restaurants homemade masa tortillas. Overall  ingredients seem to be very fresh  wait staff is very knowledgeable and proud of the food they are serving. It s a good dining experience if you are looking for a fancier meal out in Austin and are tired of the standard Tex Mex heavier plates.
Suerte,55,The closet thing you ll find to Oaxaca in the states. Definitely worth the hype  I love their Mezcal selection and the food is outrageously good. Sad it was featured on a show on the show since res s have been increasingly hard to get.
Suerte,56,Upscale-ish home-style fare... Suerte sits in a bit of an uncomfortable intersection -  classic home-style fare  and  upscale . And the results are kinda visible in the menu - some of the items are really really good  but feel quite a bit too expensive for what they are  whilst others seem a bit too twee and overwrought. However  there are occasional surprises - the tamale for example - that manage to hit the intersection perfectly. Hence - 4 stars. The occasional surprise makes it the kinda place that you want to go back to 
Suerte,57,Don t get me wrong- the food here was excellent. But really there were too many people in the dining room  packed too tightly  while covid is still a thing.  Also  while the food was excellent  like I said  it was a bit pricey for what it was. We feel like we had better tacos from some of the much  much  much  cheaper taco trucks in Austin. Just sayin ...
Suerte,58,Enjoyed dining at this spot. Great Mexican cuisine.  The carne asada rib-eye was perfect. Well marinated seasoned  with a good sear and dialed in exactly at medium well.   The sides were also nice.  They were crowded on a Saturday night  but I was able to get seated by reaching out earlier that evening.
Suerte,59,Suerte is pure perfection from start to finish. I have been here about 5 or 6 times and have never been disappointed. Between the ambiance  service  and perfectly curated dishes - this is arguably one of the best restaurants in austin.   Throughout our visits  our favorites include the Suadero tacos  you have to try them   chorizo tacos  Cascara  dessert   and the Chocotaco  dessert . We order the suadero tacos every time  they are rich  salty  tangy  and spicy. It is the perfect combo   Our recent favorite was an ube concha during brunch. It was the best concha I ve ever had and I hope they bring it back again  The desserts are impeccable and I would honestly go JUST for the cascara or chocotaco  or both      The service is always great and they are very conscious about any food allergies or dietary restrictions. The servers are well versed on the menus and provide great details and suggestions to your meal.   Beware that parking can be difficult on busy nights. They have a small parking lot if you are lucky  otherwise you will have to find street parking.  Overall  Suerte is our go to place to impress our out of town guests and to enjoy an amazing meal. I recommend making a reservation to ensure that you get a table when you arrive    P.S. they have the cutest wallpaper in the bathroom 
Suerte,60,If you ve done any research on best places to eat in Austin  I guarantee that you ve heard of Suerte. I finally got to try out this hot spot  and was seated in the bar area immediately after showing up on Sunday at 5 30pm with a friend. I would recommend making a reservation  we got lucky and most other groups were facing at least an hour wait. Suerte happy hour has some great happy hour deals on drinks from 5-6 Sun-Thurs  including 25  off bottles of wine  I ordered the Rosa Peligrosa  which was a truly phenomenal mezcal cocktail that you must try if you re a fan of egg whites in your cocktails. The guacamole and Carrot Aguachile were delicious  but do not miss out on the Suadero Tacos. They are famous at Suerte for a reason  and are the best tacos I have ever tasted. The pictures can t do them justice  they are rich  flavorful  and very filling- do yourself a favor and try them out.
Suerte,61,This is a fancy  Mexican restaurant with somewhat small portions. I do think this restaurant is expensive but the meat and vegetables are all sourced locally so you are paying for the food quality there.   This restaurant was incredibly loud. It was very hard to hear while we were talking. We got a few things to share.   We tried the Guacamole Con Macha Verde. It was delicious. Very small portion for  17. There were 5 of us and I would argue that one order of this was not enough for the 5 of us to share.   The standout dish of the night was Suadero Tacos. By far some of the best tacos I have ever eaten. The Wagyu beef was cooked to perfection. The flavor of these was out of this world. So delicious    We also shared the Quesadilla de Res. It was good but probably not our favorite.   I would not rush back here but the service was great and the restaurant is very beautiful.
Suerte,62,The suadero tacos   Is no suadero the guarache to small no sour Mexican flavor and to expensive for the quality sorry that is No Mexican food Phil maybe make special food for you
Suerte,63,My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary and we absolutely were not disappointed. We couldn t get a reservation until 9 15pm  so we bar hopped a little around the area before and built up quite the appetite. Our very kind server  Kelly  had some amazing suggestions for us  including the yaupon spritz for a refreshing cocktail. For our entrees  we had pollo al carbon and the famous Suadero tacos which were both to die for. The items are on the pricier side  but so worth it especially for a celebration. We had some great conversations with our server as well- she is actually the lead singer of Darkbird which will be playing at ACL this year so check them out if you can  Thank you Kelly for entertaining my tipsy boyfriend and I     We did come on a Wednesday night and it was very busy so keep that in mind- definitely make a reservation if you can  If not  there is also a waiting area for patrons where you can enjoy some drinks while you wait. I definitely recommend Suerte for the delicious meals  tasty cocktails  and overall great vibes.
Suerte,64,Was grateful to walk in without a resy on a Sunday brunch and be seated relatively quickly. Had a michi and bloody while we waited  both delicious. The mix they use is uniquely flavorful.   Once sat we got the chips and guac  don t recall the exact name of it but it was fantastic. Their house masa chips were extra crispy and the guac was refreshing and creamy.   We all  3  of us shared the pupusa and tacos. The confit tacos had a deep flavor perfectly balanced by the verde sauce on top. The pupusa is also pretty magical  much denser than I originally imagined but man was it delicious. A generous portion of their house masa encompassing the boldy season meat. All sitting on top of a black bean pur e that had a decadence which is hard to describe  almost reminded me of a mole-esq flavor. And don t forget this is all covered in a creamy verde sauce. Well done.
Suerte,65,Went for their brunch. Suerte has a beautiful interior design with tons of light coming into both the dining and bar areas  illuminating your meal and highlighting their vivid plates. Definitely on the pricier side  but well worth it as the staff is attentive to refill your water and the quality of ingredients  most noticably their blue masa for some dishes. Styled as tapas to be shared among a group.   -Suadero tacos Crispy outer layer with a moist fatty interior. A must get -Quesdilla de res Tasty pairing with the mole -Chilaquilles verde o divorciado  A beautifully plated dish -Huevos Tostada  Nothing too memorable
Suerte,66,This review is long overdue for my go to  and favorite restaurant in Austin. I have been here a dozen times  and have been blown away every single time. Everything from the service  to the ambiance  to the happy hour  to the entire menu is 10 10 for me. Every box is checked for what I look for in dining out when I come here.   The drinks are phenomenal  I usually go during the lucky hour where you can enjoy 7  margaritas. They even have the lucky hour on Saturday and Sunday s 3-6. I usually sub the tequila for mezcal  which they do for no extra charge  Next is the chips and salsa and chips and guacamole.. which the price may seem steep. But in my opinion their homemade chips  variety of salsa  and uniqueness of the guacamole is well worth it for me.   The absolute must order for first timers  I order at least one order every visit  is the suadero tacos. These are suertes best thing on the menu in my opinion. These are their duck confit tacos with sauce  and a huge dollop of guacamole on top. And I cannot rave about them enough. The other stand out to me was the pork chop entree. They smoke the pork chop on the spot  and it was an extremely unique dish.  Lastly  the flan is unreal  I m usually not a flan fan  however this one is phenomenal. If you have room for dessert  this is hands down the order I d recommend
Suerte,67,I cannot express how much I love the brisket tacos. I could have eaten the entire 4  tiny  tacos by myself and probably ordered another plate because I didn t want them to be over. So worth the trip for these to me.   We also tried the guac and pork tostada. The guac is pretty basic and not worth the    see above and use it on the tacos  We wanted to try the Barbacoa but they had run out for the night. Will be back to try those.
Suerte,68,First time visit with friends for dinner and this place didn t disappoint. This spot is cozy with a lovely ambiance and decor. We ordered a variety of dishes and cocktails. Everything was spot on - even saved room for dessert - delicious  This place is worth the visit - can t wait to come back soon.
Suerte,69,We heard that the brisket tacos were so good they d leave you speechless and they did not disappoint   They were seriously some of the best tacos I ve ever had. The brisket tacos were topped with fresh onions and guacamole from their garden. The guacamole was so fresh and crisp. We also shared the colache which was kind of like taco challah bread. It had warm havarti  cilantro  onions  and beef picadillo inside. I don t even like ground meat but am still dreaming about it  Even if you re vegan or vegetarian  there are tons of delicious options at Suerte. Some of the food is expensive but it was SO worth it   The inside was super cute and trendy and the service was phenomenal as well  Our waiter gave us recommendations  answered our questions  and brought our items to us very quickly. Suerte is a MUST while in Austin 
Suerte,70,Honestly  everything we ordered was great. There are a couple of stand-outs but overall a very solid place with an amazing atmosphere and staff.  I went on a first date here  haha  and we came on a Thursday night. It was pretty busy  but we only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. We were able to order drinks at this little side table before they moved us to a seat at the bar. I love a cocktail with egg-white in it  so the Rosa Peligrosa was great. Had enough alcohol in it to keep my nerves in check  but it was also very palatable  and a pretty drink  I must add .  NOW THE FOOD  1. Lentils dip  The lentils were cooked with a good amount of flavor and the amount of oil they used was just right. Left a buttery feel on my mouth without feeling too greasy. Yogurt was a nice touch to add some dimension to the dish.  2. Hamachi Crudo. Melon broth was sooo refreshing. We got two shots of mezcal at this point  and I loved alternating between a sip of mezcal and some of the broth.  3. Huarache. My only qualm with this dish is I did not love that it felt a bit soggy    Usually love mushrooms but this dish just needed more texture.  4. Suadero Tacos. GET THESE. THEY ARE HYPED UP FOR A REASON. I can t even put into words how tasty they were.   5. Alambre. The goat was definitely good  but the Suadero tacos really overshadowed this dish for me.   The bartenders were so nice. I can only remember one of their names unfortunately  but we met a couple throughout the night. Thank you Miles    the others  for your help with mezcal picks. We started with the well mezcal and then a round of their choice of mezcal. We got the Tepeztate which was described as the funkier older sister and the Jabal   which is more of a basic beginner mezcal.  Not sure about a second date with the guy I was with  but I ll definitely make a second trip here by myself  
Suerte,71,All good is excellent  Real Mexican and real gourmet. I would definitely come back.  Love pollo and ceviche
Suerte,72,There were only three of us in our party but none of us liked our food. And it was very expensive for the food we received  on top of just not liking it.   Actually  none of us liked our mixed drinks either. So  double bad experience... I guess.   Guacamole con macha verde was the only this we all agreed was ok.   Quesadilla de res Goat barbacoa No bueno
Suerte,73,Hip elevated Mexican food.  Everything done well.  Brisket tacos was the group favorite.  Service was on point and food came quick.
Suerte,74,Ian  bartender  was our server  as we waited for seating at the bar  per other Yelp recommendations. Wow  We were so impressed  What a fun night  Thanks so much  Ian  for helping us with selecting food and drinks. We highly  highly  recommend this restaurant. Five stars plus.
Suerte,75,Have been dying to go to Suerte and snagged a reservation on our latest trip to Austin for our anniversary. Very interesting take on Mexican food  which was refreshing  We started with the guacamole that was absolutely to die for and tried the special  which was the grilled iceberg that was out of this world  So good and so thoughtful with the flavor profiles. Suadero tacos are a must.have. Like literally top 5 best things  best thing I have ever eaten   The downer was actually the quesadilla which we had heard so much about. The corn tortilla just had such an overpowering taste that you really couldn t taste anything else  which is a bummer considering there was wagyu short rib in it  Definitely will be adding Suerte into our Austin rotation.
Suerte,76,Honestly think it s my favorite spot to bring people when they visit austin. Always electric vibes  delicious  amp  authentic Mexican food  and good service and cocktails.   Don t miss out on the suadero tacos 
Suerte,77,Went here for Saturday brunch with a party of 6 and loved it  They were very accommodating when we had 1 more join our original reservation of 5. All of the drinks were delicious  the atmosphere was cute  and the food was yummy  We got guac for the table and my friend  amp  I shared the tacos and quesadilla. Will definitely be returning to check out the dinner menu 
Suerte,78,Please do not visit this place. I usually don t write reviews  but this place is the worst restaurant I have ever dined in. I order appetizers and some drinks. The EGGPLANT SIKIL PAK was the worst thing I have ever put in my mouth. When we finally got seated at our table  the waiter got bitter because I moved the table in a form that I could sit with my wife and enjoy eating our dinner next to each other. The disrespect and rudeness of the apparent manager were off the charts to the point that I decided to leave without eating. Management should consider training their employees on proper communicating with the customers and finding solutions instead of just saying no to everything. I will tell everyone I know not to visit this restaurant. If I could  I would give zero stars.
Suerte,79,I was not impressed when I came to visit this restaurant again on 7 24 22 . I live on the east side of Austin  so I frequent here regularly. This last time me and my boyfriend were going to go to have a drink at the bar and the hostess was being very off putting about us sitting there.  First we sat at the cocktail area and then we saw that you sit were available as soon as we try to keep up the seats the hostess stopped us.  She said we needed a reservation for the bar seats and I said for the bar and she said oh no never mind.  Then the bartender was also being offputting by saying did you check in for your reservation with the hostess. It s bar seating I ve never had to check in with the hostess or I ve had to make a reservation here.   We then got our water in the menu and did not get attended until some time had passed.  I was obviously not gonna give money to an establishment that has been rude and also doesn t acknowledges while we re at the bar trying to order drinks and food.  We went next-door instead and had a lovely drink.
Suerte,80,Have a reservation or come early knowing you ll have to wait  but soooo worth the wait   walkable brewery  coffee shops while you wait for your table. Come hungry  This is a must when visiting Austin. I need to come back for their weekend brunch  This restaurant is truly farm to table and they get produce from their own garden. The guacamole con macha verde is the only kind of guac I ever want. I was worried about the pistachios but it s a game changer. The carne asada was delicious  Save room for the tres leches   
Suerte,81,Y all. We ate ALL THE FOOD. We came here for my husband s bday. It s been on his list but we can never seem to get a reservation when we happen to be in Austin. We landed a 10 30 pm slot and proceeded to order more than half the menu...literally. Everything was absolutely delicious. They were great about bringing the food out in stages rather than all at once  let s be honest  it wouldn t have all fit on the table . The masa tortillas were incredible and unlike any other house made tortillas I ve had. This place really takes you on a journey of all regions of Mexico  and showcases the true culinary art of the country rather than dumbing it down to just street tacos  not that there s anything wrong with street tacos . MUST TRIES IMO  suadero tacos  molotes  barbacoa  the best I ve ever had   monkfish. If you want to throw something light and bright in there  the peaches with basil and feta was surprisingly special. And for dessert  look no further than the cascara. We also ordered the tres leches  it s a fave of mine   but the cascara was the star. Go on an empty stomach and enjoy 
Suerte,82,Suerte was so good.   We were told that the food is inspired by Mexican and Indigenous cooking. It was all so good.   I ordered the Pep Talk cocktail. It was delicious. Our bar tender was also very friendly and knowledgeable I let him choose my next drink. It was also very delicious.  We ordered  CEVICHE DE COCO which we really liked. It was beautiful and delicious.  TLAYUDA DE HONGOS which was kind of like a mushroom tostada pizza. It was so good. I love mushrooms.  SUADERO TACOS which were 4 small tacos with guac. It was very delicious.  It was pricy but worth it.
Suerte,83,I kept hearing amazing things about Suerte and I thought I d be let down because my expectations were too high. I was wrong. This place is soo good. Carne asada is a 10 10 and the potato fritters were amazing as well. Will definitely come back.
Suerte,84,My very favorite meal in Austin even if i couldn t province the name of the restaurant the entire time I was there.
Suerte,85,My husband and I ended up coming for dinner after having to reschedule from brunch.   If you are wanting to visit  make sure you make reservations at least a couple of weekends out.   The service was GREAT. Jonathan was our server and was almost perfect. The interior decor is very intentionally and just beautiful.  My husband ordered a margarita and I had a mock tail. Both were refreshing. We shared the ceviche  the one with white fish   it was ok for me  but my husband really enjoyed it.   I ordered the half Chicken for dinner and my husband ordered the wagyu brisket tacos. We asked for habanero sauce on the side. Both were amazing. Well cooked and flavorful.  My toddler became very difficult mid meal  so I wasn t able to grab a dinner photo  but our dishes were great. We will definitely plan to come back for date night.
Suerte,86,There were no reservations available  so I left work an hour early to see if we could nab a spot before the dinner rush.  It totally paid off. We got to the restaurant and we were seated at a table immediately. I already knew what I wanted   Suadero tacos Oxtail tacos  And some produce-- our server recommended the Peaches and Mango  I spied the table across from us and saw the massive chips  so we got some of that with the Snapper Ceviche  Everything was good  but the star of the show was the suadero tacos  with a touch of the goddess dressing from the peaches and mango. There was a hint of spice.  The don dario was a very tasty cocktails with a nice mellow tamarind flavor.  The snapper ceviche was so fresh  it was reminiscent of a caprese salad  with the tomato broth and basil bits.  I d been wanting to go here for months  but I live in San Antonio and I d have to haul over to get here for dinner. It was not easy  but luckily  my friend had a hotel room I could crash in after the food coma.
Suerte,87,My all time favorite restaurant in Austin. There isn t a ton of places in Austin to get upscale Mexican food  but this is one of them. The steak is life changing. They do a great job at keeping elements of traditional Mexican cooking while adding a creative twist.
Suerte,88,Suerte was one of the few upscale restaurants we tried in Austin  and it ended up being one of our favorites. You definitely need to make a reservation ahead of time -- we got lucky with a last minute reservation opening up. The interior ambience was bright and warm  and the service was great. We ordered the quesadilla and tacos. Both tasted great but the tacos were just amazing  Overall  a great date night spot or if you re feeling fancy Mexican food.
Suerte,89,Unbelievable flavors and top-notch service. Our group struggled to decide which dishes made the cut and enjoyed everything we ordered. The Suadero Tacos are a must and I wish I could have tried all of the ceviches  but I don t think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.
Suerte,90,In my opinion  it s hard to beat a Mexican brunch. This is an upscale contemporary Mexican restaurant with correspondingly pricy food. I would say it is definitely worth at least one visit while staying in Austin. The tostadas were delicious  as were the cocktails  loved the Medicina Latina . The service was very attentive and fun. I ll come back again to try the lucky hour.
Suerte,91,Excellent food with creative twist. Fabulous margarita  Have them recommend something for you.
Suerte,92,We have officially been here twice and both times were amazing. We ve only been for brunch lunch  but it was so good. The service is awesome. The staff has always been extremely helpful and friendly. Love the ambiance and the vibe of the restaurant  Great interiors. They have indoor seating  a little outdoor and a bar inside. Make a reservation if you can   Highly recommend the suadero tacos. We also love the enchiladas and the chilaquiles. Their cocktails are also to die for. Definitely worth a trip  
Suerte,93,Awesome  Great take on Mexican  good drinks  friendly service and everything came out quickly  Attentive service and delicious food is hard to find these days and Suerte nailed it.  We got the tiradito  tamal  and tacos and all were delicious and had their own non-traditional flair. Drop by if you re in the mood for a higher-end  amazing quality take on Mexican.  PS don t leave without getting the tacos 
Suerte,94,I dined here this week with two friends  one with significant food allergies. The waiter called in air support and a senior staffer came over  went through the entire menu with a pencil  and showed my friend what was edible  what was modifiable  and what was not safe to eat. That s some amazing service.  We ordered a variety of things and had a really good experience. The wagyu steak was of course delicious  but the sauce it was in was stunning. The scallop dish was an amazing contrast of soft perfectly cooked scallop with crunchy vegetables  and ceviche flounder was a table hit.  To finish it off  my friend smelled some really delicious coffee brewing at the end of our meal  and that was a perfect end to a delicious evening.
Suerte,95,This place is simply amazing  Reservations sell out quickly  so make sure you check their website way prior to wanting to dine in    When you first walk in  the ambience is perfect  The decorations  vibe and everything is spot on. The hostesses are very friendly  and everyone is greeted.  There were so many cocktails that caught my eye  but I decided to go with the Medicina Latina  frozen  which was probably THE best choice  The drink is blended to perfection and you re able to taste each ingredient in the drink. It s strong but not overwhelming  I should ve ordered another lol.   For dinner we ordered the Suadero tacos and the chicken entree  can t think of the name . The tacos...exceptional  Definitely get them  The tortilla is super fresh and soft  and the meat is tender and flavorful. My bf said the chicken dish was super tender  grilled to perfection and perfect inside of the tortillas they were served with.   For dessert we got the chocotaco and a complimentary ice cream dessert  SO good  for our anniversary. The chocotaco had the perfect crunch with the peanuts on the outside. Only thing is the dessert has frozen cinnamon mousse inside  so you will need a knife to cut it.   Our server was super nice and knowledgeable as well  we will definitely be back  
Suerte,96,Came here for my birthday as my partner really wanted to try suerte. We have to make our reservations one month in advance on resy  and even then we could only get an 8 45pm slot. They asked about any special celebrations on resy but they didn t really do anything for birthdays. So if you would like the restaurant to celebrate a special day  I would suggest other places like uchi  peaches tortilla  or the tatsuya restaurants. The place was extremely noisy  so not really a place to dine if you are trying to have a conversation. It s also pretty dimly lit  which is a nice ambience. There were a lot of staff compared to most other similar restaurants  and they were prompt in clearing empty dishes but it took some time to get their attention for a check. The food arrived in a good waiting time and was briefly explained by the servers. However I would recommend them adding a bit on how they recommend the dishes to be eaten. We ordered the lengua  quesadilla and the half chicken. Our favorite was the quesadilla. The flavor was savory and the salsa was delicious. The lengua was pretty good but it was difficult to figure how to eat it  as a taco  Or do we cut it up in small bites  . The chicken was a little too salty for my liking even though the flavor was good. But the meat was tender and a good portion. Overall  between the two of us  with me being a small eater  three dishes were too much food. Would recommend getting the smaller plates if you are a small eater.
Suerte,97,Overall great date spot or girls night out. Upscale casual  trendy   40 per person . Make a reservation. Tacos were the best item ordered- come in plates of 4 so easy to share.   Went on a double date here with no reservation. Walked in at 6pm and were told it would be a 45 min wait  so we went across the street for a drink. Table ended up being ready in 30 min but here s the catch- when they text you your table is ready reply 1 immediately and check in at the host stand within 10 minutes. We checked in a little later than 10 minutes and they had already re-seated our table- they are very strict on this time rule  and understand why given how crowded the place gets .  After waiting another 20-30 minutes for a table we were seated. The host stand still wiggled us in which was nice of them. The decor is interesting and trendy. Restaurant can get loud but you can still talk over the noise.  We ordered multiple things and did family style. Tacos come in 4- recommend the goat barbarcoa and waygu brisket tacos. Ceviche was good but not unique- I d spend my money on their meat dishes-and the roasted sweet potato was very Smokey but delicious as a side. Food was good  and came out to about  40 per person.
Suerte,98,Delicious and innovative. Masa incorporated dishes for starter  tuna tiradito   1st course  squash  and main  rabbit  as well as in the chocolate dessert. Wonderful flavors  substantial portions and excellent service made this a fantastic dining experience. Worth the detour to Austin 
Suerte,99,Everything I had hoped for and more.   You can tell they put a lot of attention and care into every item on the menu  even the drinks have the perfect amount of salt on the rim.  Refried lentils  5 5 Why don t more places use lentils in place of beans   So good and their house made masa chips are delicious. Not too thick.. not to thin and flimsy.. absolutely perfect.   7 during lucky hour   Chiltomate Almendrado  with nopales   5 5 Wish I could give it more stars. Is it bad that my favorite thing I ordered was an appetizer  It was delicious  I can t say anything more. Made from charred tomatoes and ground almond and whatever other magical ingredients and toppings  it was truly amazing.   7 during lucky hour   Suadero Tacos  5 5 Yes they really are as good as people are raving about. So much delicious brisket in each taco. The black magic sauce has fermented black bean  if you ve ever ordered black bean spare ribs at a Chinese restaurant  you ll recognize the flavor immediately . It s perfect with the avocado topping an onion- don t omit it   Chamorro Taquitos  5 5 Like mini deep fried tacos with pickled cauliflower  star anise flavored black bean  and their black magic sauce. Independently  each part of the dish is kinda funky  but together it s perfect.   Drinks- Don Dario  5 5  Best tequila drink ever   8 during lucky hour   Nada Paloma  5 5 Just when I thought this place couldn t get better  they hit me with this gem of a drink. Literally wanted to order 5 more but we all have limits.  Beer   mezcalito  lil babe of a half mezcal shot   It s a shot of mezcal with an alright beer  but for  8 during lucky hour.. totally worth.  Tepache  5 5 Wow. Better than my home brew tepache  also not a surprise    Dessert  because my stomach is a black hole  Carrot tres leches  4 5 It was veryyyy carrot-y. Austin has a surprising obsession with carrot cake. The cake was a traditional tres leches sponge  but part of the soaking liquid was definitely carrot juice and boy oh boy did that flavor come through. I got this to-go because I was getting full.
Suerte,100,The food was incredible and the restaurant itself it beautiful. We made a reservation but weren t seated until 30 minutes later. We had made a special birthday request for one of our friends but they brought out the cookie to the table next to to us so we were a little disappointed with the wait and miscommunication. They did acknowledge the long wait and gave us complimentary guacamole which was really delicious.   The standouts of our meal were the suadero tacos  frijoles envenenados and the quesadilla de res. Would order all of these again. We felt the portions were good and we left feeling satisfied.   Overall would come again. Make a reservation we made one a week in advance for dinner on a Monday 
Suerte,101,Suerte you were over the top good. Came in last minute for a birthday dinner for five people. Mario is so accommodating and gave us such a wonderful time. The food was beyond delicious. I think my favorite is the blue corn quesadilla. Your whole concept is super high-quality experience. Thank you for the best birthday dessert  sage ice cream   Can t wait to come back 
Suerte,102,Personally  I didn t really see the hype. It s mediocre food for a substantial price. The staff was attentive but did seat an extra chair off the side of our table which was in the way of everyone walking by even with a reservation well in advance.  There was plenty of parking on the bright side and the restaurant had a great ambiance though. It s definitely a great spot for a date night and less of a group in my opinion.
Suerte,103,Went for brunch with a group of 6 on a Sunday morning and it was packed  Parking was hard to find on the street since their parking lot was completely full. The waitress was super attentive and helpful to our group. Great atmosphere and the food was flavorful. The menu is pricey for traditional Mexican dishes  however it s a more upscale experience in the middle of Austin  so I m not surprised.
Suerte,104,We came here a bit on a whim after trying to go to a few other spots for lunch and I m so glad we did.   We got  Paloma on tap - Hell yes Margarita - Delicious Nixta Licor de Elote - Just had a taste but damn it was good Iced Tea - Comes unsweet but is served with agave syrup Elote - Such a great surprise  I could ve just eaten this and been happy Guacamole - Chips were earthy  like in a really good way and the guac was super fresh Pozole - Ordered because it was raining and cold but probably wouldn t get otherwise Pupusa - Never famous for having the most flavor  I thought this was delicious and the pickled veggies were a great touch Chilaquiles - So so so so so so so good. Did I say so good  They were so good.  Saturday lunch seems relatively busy without being overwhelming. Our server was absolutely delightful. Overall it s a great spot for a date and looks like it could be good for smaller groups of friends to share with. Will definitely be back.
Suerte,105,The food was amazing and so was the service   We sat at the bar and the bartender gave us the best recommendations and was very attentive. Will definitely be back soon 
Suerte,106,I lived in Mexico for 6mo and it s hard for me not to compare. Anyhow  here it goes   Overall everything is of excellent quality. However in Mexico the salsa game can make it break you. And that s where Suerte requires improvement. Aside from one dish  Tetela   not one dish came with any salsas and were crucially missing the flavor balance  zest and heat expected from great Mexican food. Details below   Tepache Mode  cocktail   excellent mezcal based drink. Smokey  perfectly balanced  just delicious  amp  great complement to the food that easily reminds me of the mezcalerias in CDMX.   Chamorro Taquito  not bold enough. Just beef and tasty crunchy taco dominate. Would love more spice  stronger flavor from more pickled cauliflower  which i barely tasted . Also feels overpriced at  14 for 2 small tacos  honestly.   Lentil Dip  excellent  very flavorful and the masa crisp it s served with is fantastic.   Braised greens tetela  very good primarily because of the strong vegetal notes from the collard greens and the excellent spicy green sauce served on the side. Again though  leans towards a bit overpriced. This isn t a fine dining in NYC. It s elevated tacos.   Suadero Taco  just ok. Think braised beef with plain avocado. Where s the spice  the lime or pickled onions or any of the bold flavors expected in Mexican food. Solid  good quality but the others above were better.   Quesadilla Roja  the best dish of the night again crucially missing some heat and great salsa to accompany. Served with butter    I love risk taking but butter added to fatty pork and melted cheese  Anyhow  order this   Overall i enjoyed Suerte and there s real talent in the kitchen. Just great salsas away from excellence.
Suerte,107,Since recently indulging in Suerte s Suadero tacos  I have been enamored. Enthralled. Perhaps even in awe. These tacos are my everything. The dish is so simple  yet so exquisite. So humble  yet brash. So recognizable  yet unique.   The beauty of the taco is it s composition at first glance seems so basic. Corn tortilla  hearty portions of brisket  topped with a dash of guacamole to get the taste buds moving. But don t be fooled  these master their places in the dish  as they dance smoothly en route to tie the entire experience together. While the rich and tender wagyu brisket confit provides a welcomed greeting to start each bite  the robust taste of the rightfully coined  black magic oil  is the conversation piece that keeps you there.    Thank you Suerte. I ll see you soon.
Suerte,108,I ve dined in banquet halls upon mountains and consumed specialty dishes from lands unseen by mortals  but these Suadero Tacos are the most delectable tacos I ve ever tasted. The meat is savory  the sauce is spicy  and it s all laid to rest to tortillas crafted right behind the counter.  My trusty Falcamera perched upon my broad shoulder and captured them for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy.
Suerte,109,Pluses and minuses  Loved the Suerte tacos for the flavor but they were so salty that we almost could rate anything else. 2 stars  Pork belly with masa tacos  this time I got to taste the masa  and the pork belly and apple and spices were very easy to identify and enjoy. 4 stars. Spicy though   If the salt level were taken back 50-100  on the suerte tacos  this place would have been much easier to enjoy at a 4-5 star level
Suerte,110,Delicious drinks and thoughtfully prepared tacos and chip dip combos. Suadero tacos were the standout star. Would definitely return.
Suerte,111,Sooooooo yummy and fresh and innovative. Service was first rate. Very cool vibe. Healthy portions. Great cocktails.
Suerte,112,This spot really hit all the marks for me   -Beautiful interior  -Delicious cocktails  -Top notch staff at every turn  -Delicious  fresh and beautifully presented food   Perfection all around 
Suerte,113,3.5 5  The dishes here are conceptually good. Great take on brunch. Eggs on some mexican style dishes.  The chefs here clearly know how to make good food. The meats were juicy and flavorful. The dough was fried perfectly. All the ingredients are also high quality. The issue is that all of the dishes here were really overly salty. It was so salty that you really craved tons of water and even something sour or sweet to counter it. It s a minor fix that would absolutely change this place from 3.5 to 5 stars.   The carrot tres leches was great though. It was an interesting take on the usual tres leches. The cake was moist and you taste the carrot infusion. I love the crispy carrot spirals on top as well. Lastly  the passionfruit sauce really tied it all in together and added the tanginess you needed. 10 10
Suerte,114,Their brisket tacos and guac are absolutely incredible  One of our favorite spots for a date night. The menu boasts lots of flavors- savory  spicy  and sweet  Drinks are great  staff is always wonderful  and their outdoor seating is lovely. Parking can be difficult since it s in the middle of the action  but they have a couple of rows to park and there s street parking around the block if all spots are taken. Highly recommend a reservation to ensure that you get a table 
Suerte,115,Lovely ambiance and delicious food  I m all about highlighting restaurants that take food allergies seriously given my partner s ordeal with them. They were excellent  Our waiter  JJ  was so attentive as was the Chef. They curated a menu for him    My favorites were the pulpo tostada  chicken pipiripau  and carrot aguachile. I don t think I ve ever had such a carrot-forward dish that wasn t just carrots taste so delicious. The tlayuda de hongos was my last favorite but I m big on texture so others may love it.   The cocktails were taste-bud appealing as well  The Lucky Hour is nice to partake in for lightening the load on the wallet.   Thanks for a scrumptious experience Suerte 
Suerte,116,I have to tell you that Suerte has been the best dining experience I have had in Austin.  I wrote to Suerte to let them know of my previous experience and they responded very quickly.  They were incredibly apologetic  and not only did they refund the price of the dish that was bad  but they also sent me a  50 gift card to use on our next visit.  Now I don t know if they had flagged my next reservation or what  but I will tell you  when we went back for our second visit  they were on it.  Our first visit was for dinner with no reservation  our second visit was for brunch with a reservation.    The service was excellent.  Before we even had a chance to order an appetizer  they dropped off a complimentary Empanada.  I have to tell you  this Empanada was probably the best empanada I have ever had.  It was the second best thing that we ate that day.  We let the server and a manager know how good it was  and they mentioned that they had actually sold out of them  so they were really glad we had a chance to taste it.  A few minutes later  a second Empanada arrived at our table.  It was a little  burst  so they weren t going to sell it  but they knew how much we enjoyed the first one the brought us  so they brought us this one too.  Talk about excellent service.  We ordered the Luna Sangre  non alcoholic beverage  and added Gin.  If you read me previous review  you will see that we ordered this previously as well and really loved it except that it was served in the wrong type of glass.  I again have to compliment the management team.  When the drinks were delivered this time  they were served in a larger glass  and the drinks were even more often.  It is really nice to know that management is so responsive to constructive criticism.  The food was good as always  but I will say  that at the end of the day  I think I will just stick with ordering the Suadero tacos.  It is nice to taste other items  but so far  nothing compares to the Suadero tacos.  They are amazing  and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The last highlight of the meal was the desert  which I have to say I was a bit nervous about it.  I grew up in South Texas and I was never a fan of Concha.  They were always kind of dry  and not very sweet  which isn t really my idea of a pastry.  Well the Concha at Suerte was amazing  like no Concha I have ever tasted.  It was so moist  almost like sponge cake.  It is served with a marshmellow fluff  and when you put the two together with the excellent coffee they serve  it is heaven.  My girlfriend hasn t stopped talking about it and can t wait to go back again just for the Concha.  I feel like service in Austin has always been a little suspect  even at the higher end places.  Well Suerte knocks it out of the park.  When you drop the kind of coin it takes to eat here  I can guarantee you that you will get a  quality product and service that lives up to the prices and the hype.  Wish that could be said about more of the establishments in Austin.  Go to Suerte    You will not be dissapointed.    Walk ins accepted but reservations recommended.
Suerte,117,We had a great dinner at Suerte  The dishes are meant to be shared and we ordered a bunch of different vegetarian and meat dishes for the table. All in all  we ordered  Goat Barbacoa  Tamal en Mole Blanco  Huarache  Sunchokes Y Beets  and Sweet Papas  all of these were delicious and are recommended. We each ordered an horchata to drink which was reaaaallly good  you absolutely must order it  For dessert  we went a little overboard and ordered all three desserts  Pastel Rosa  Chocotaco  and C scara. The Pastel Rosa was incredibly soft and perfectly sweet. The Chocotaco was definitely way better than expected  the description kind of sells it short. The C scara was interesting  but none of us at the table were big fans to be honest. Service was great throughout our dinner. Overall  highly recommended 
Suerte,118,Everything we had was delicious and the service was great  We had a group of 5 adults so ordered most of the menu  food and drinks  and everything was delicious  The guacamole  ceviche  and the beef cheek were our favorite food items. Highly recommend 
Suerte,119,Great gem of Austin. Warm  cozy and great ambiance. Friendly staff and great food. The food is a bit pricey with portions on the smaller side. They have a few good vegetarian options also - Huarache and Tamal. The Tamal was yummy but rather small in size. They have a good selection of cocktails also - we liked Nada Paloma  mezcal and tequila  and La Melena  bourbon . And do not miss their chips and guac - the guac was among the best ones I found in Austin.
Suerte,120,Delicious all around  We had a couple new dishes we had not experienced before and our server was outstanding. The standouts were the cerviche  it was like a citrusy explosion in the mouth and the brisket tacos. Normally a dessert for me is an after thought and I was hesitant to order the Cascara because I thought it would be more fruity and I m a chocolate girl. I ended up ordering the chocolate dessert but our server insisted and brought us a complimentary Cascara in addition. It is the best dessert I ve had to date. It s a shell that you crack open with all sorts of goodies. Butter pecan  cream  apples  it s the bomb   Highly recommend Suerte 
Suerte,121,Excellent first visit at Suerte  I d definitely recommend making a reservation as soon as you solidify plans  up to 1-2 weeks before won t hurt   especially if it s on a weekend and you re trying to catch happy hour   All of the food we had was excellent and perfect for sharing across our table of four- appetizers like chips and pistachio guacamole   16   ceviche   18   suadero tacos   18   and sweet papas   11  and the best entree was the barbacoa   38 .  Would definitely recommend stopping by here for a taste of authentic Mexican cuisine compared to the typical Tex-Mex around town  Look forward to visiting again with some additional friends and family.
Suerte,122,Yum. Yum. Yum.   From the moment you pull open the obnoxiously heavy door you realize you re in for a treat.   Wifey ordered the Baja Bree-o with a rum float and I had the Don Dario. Delicious and light. Let s be honest  we ordered a second. They were delicious.   We started with the guacamole con macha verde and garibaldi. The guac had multiple layers of flavor and there was a place for each note. The chips are large  thick corn tortillas which you break your chosen size from to the the guac in your mouth. The garibaldi was dense and spongy at the same time with a light strawberry  and the sugar crunch. I want to go back and have this with a press pot of coffee.   We shared the chilaquiles with both chile pequin and salsa verde - best of both worlds. I recommend the land of and. We also shared the empanada- the salsa was a wonderful smoky punch.   I love the minimalist atmosphere and how the acoustic art absorbed noise while adding to the ambiance. The restroom signs  although gender specific  are super cute           .   The only thing I m sad about - is my meal being over. Excited to go back 
Suerte,123,Great atmosphere  Margarita was incredible and the Carne Asada was awesome with the fresh homemade masa tortillas. Highly recommend 
Suerte,124,I never had a more disrespectful waitress in my life. In todays day and age if your a white male you are already hated and I ve never met a waitress that prejudge like we were some horrible white men. We treated her with the upmost respect and right from the start it was nothing but short remarks. After all that we still even tipped her over 20  and she couldn t even deliver us our bill. I grew up working in the service industry and contradictory to what I believe  I never let that get ahead of me because all guest deserve to have a great experience. That includes no matter who they are  what they look like  or what their gender is.  The waitress with the pink hair screams man hater. This restaurant wants to be progressive so bad  yet their employees have no clear manner of how to do it respectfully and properly.
Suerte,125,Loved up to the hype   Everything was so delicious. We had a party of 4 and did a walk-in. The wait was an hour but we ended up only waiting 20 mins because a reservation canceled. We are the lucky ones  our waitress was super kind. The food  of course  stole the show. The chicken was juicy  the suadero tacos were AMAZING. You must order them. We ordered two dishes. My drink  the baja brrr-o was so good especially with the added rum float.
Suerte,126,The host told me 1 hour wait  so I waited 1 hour and returned to the restaurant.  When I returned  he said I d have to wait another hour... unreal. The worst customer service I ve seen in hundreds of restaurants.  9 27 2022   6PM -10 Stars.
Suerte,127,Everything we tried here was amazing and the quality makes it worth the high price. We started with the guacamole and ceviche  both very good dishes that I would order again. Next  we had the pork chop and sweet papas  also both good. There was a nice kick of spice to the sweet papas which was a bit strong for me personally  but I still enjoyed it. The pork chop was decent and came with fresh corn tortillas on the side  but not sure if I would order it again. Overall  I loved this place and hope to dine here again  
Suerte,128,BF and I decided to come visit Suerte after learning about its owner through Taco Chronicles on Netflix.   They were decently busy on a Saturday evening  but managed to seat us in no time in their outside  patio . I say  patio  because it was about 4 picnic bench style tables under a pop-up canopy with a small fan in the corner. Our server was alright  not very attentive and failed to give us our receipt at the end  but he got the job done.  I ordered the suadero tacos and BF ordered the agua chile. You can tell that the ingredients are high quality and thoughtfully pieced together. The meat in the taco was so tender and succulent and of course the fresh tortilla was a nice touch. Unfortunately  it was just lacking that  something special . The flavors were kind of one note. Same with the agua chile. You could tell the ingredients were top notch  but the flavors came together in a very subtle way. For the price and the expectation  we wanted more from the experience.   BF ordered a special mezcal drink and I got their passion fruit tres leches cake  served with sweet potato crunchies on top and flower petals. Not sure how the drink tasted  but like everything else  it was pretty expensive for what it was. The dessert was yummy. Definitely a unique melding of flavors and textures. The cake was almost too mushy  but the crunchy sweet potato on top balanced out the texture.   Overall  I can appreciate what they re trying to do here with the quality of ingredients and the play on flavors and textures. However  I think it leaves something to be desired.
Suerte,129,I just wanted to give a shout-out to our server JORDAN     He was PHENOMENAL  1000 stars if that was possible    This was our first time dining at the restaurant and he made our experience memorable. He went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. He was very knowledgeable and had such an awesome sense of humor. Very friendly and personable. I would highly recommend this place because of the level of customer service.  The food was AMAZING too    MUST COME EAT HERE  Book your reservation if you haven t already and you won t be disappointed.   We had the Suadero tacos  that s a must.  I also really enjoyed the Refried Lentils y Crema and Bistec Y Huevos. The meat melted in my mouth. It was perfection.   BUEN PREVECHO.
Suerte,130,Came back in for my second dining experience here and everything fell in place to make for an exceptional meal. They really took care of my multiple food sensitivities by checking on any discrepancies with the chefs  and even took the initiative of marking up a personal menu with all available options for me.   On this visit  I ended up ordering the chiltomate almendrado  brisket tacos  and beef shank taquitos. I got the almendrado on my last visit as well  and if I m getting something again you can bet that it s great. It s creamy  spicy and packed with flavor -- good as a starter  but also acted great as a salsa for spicing up my other dishes as well.  The tacos were perfect -- tender brisket on their famously addictive nixta tortillas... seriously  tortillas so good that I even had to get an order of them to bring home . I had actually eaten many tacos this week already  and I honestly picked these up with a slight notion of  here we go again ....but when they first hit my mouth  they REALLY made an impact that instantly washed away any hints of experiencing anything less than the superior  unique and flavorful tacos before me that truly were an experience to be appreciative of.  The taquitos were also great. Beef shank stood up as an extremely tasty cut of meat for the dish  giving it a satisfactory meatiness in every crisp bite.  With how many menu items that were available to me even while avoiding gluten  dairy and eggs  I m very excited to be back for my next meal. Thank you for taking my dietary needs seriously and providing a safe spot for future date nights 
Suerte,131,This place deserves every last star  it s truly incredible. Normally  restaurants of this caliber are overly pretentious and excessively expensive. Not so with Suerte  although you should expect to wait weeks to get in. It s hard to snag a table and to my knowledge  there isn t really a reliable waitlist.  Starting with dessert first  because it was actually the most savory part of the meal   CARROT TRES LECHES Almost-savory style carrot cake drenched in a not-too-sweet passionfruit reduction. I particularly liked the garnish and cream-cheese icing.  5 5 -- but don t expect a traditional carrot cake   REFRIED LENTILS Y CREMA It s virtually against the house rules not to order the refried lentils. And it s not hard to see why  this dish is delicious. Not your regular chips and salsa   TAMAL EN MOLE BL ANCO As you will see in the photo  this is doused in a delicious sauce and every layer of the dish gets better from there  it has an almost  cake  like texture to it and incorporates crushed pine nuts.  GRILLED SWEET PAPAS Deliciously roasted soft sweet potato  seasoned with habanero garlic oil  that wasn t overpowering  with creamy aioli underneath.  Being vegetarian  we found some good options on the menu  it would be good if they developed a vegetarian indicator for the menu or expanded vegetarian dishes a little but  on the whole we were satisfied. The server brought out some taco tortillas for us to make some veggie tacos from the Cauliflower and Sweet Potato. I could literally eat the tortillas on their own they were so good.  On the drink side  the sparking wines are good  two to choose from   the cocktails are more on the classically-modern side with contemporary glassware adaptations.  Definitely would be back.
Suerte,132,Expect the unexpected with each morsel of deliciousness from the Peaches and Feta salad to the Goat Barbacoa wrapped in a banana leaf.  Each plate is thoughtful with the ingredients.  This is leveling up 
Suerte,133,Outstanding dinner  outstanding service. Everything was just wonderful   We sat at the bar and everyone that helped us was super friendly and super helpful.
Suerte,134,i discovered suerte on instagram and finally went over the weekend. my bf   i went for brunch and had a great time. the decor is very sleek but inviting at the same time. our server was wonderful and explained the menu well. i appreciate them experimenting and switching up the menu often.  the drinks were great  i really enjoyed the don dario. for food  we tried the pupusa  chilaquiles  pan de elote  and croissant. the savory dishes were delicious  you can tell the masa is fresh. my favorite part of the meal was definitely dessert. the croissant was outstanding  lots of flaky layers and a delicate  vanilla   filing. the corn cake was a lil heavy but was moist and flavorful.  i m sure i d be update to five stars with a few more visits. the desserts really stood out to me but i d love to try other savory dishes in the future. i noticed lots of people ordering tacos - i must go back soon 
Suerte,135,During my visit in Austin  a local said this place was a must try so my friends and I made reservations. Once we arrived  we were seated immediately but after that  there was nothing but waiting. The server came  she seemed tired and unhappy. The service was terrible and the food was garbage. The portions were tiny and lacked flavor. The drinks were sub par. Overall it was very disappointing.
Suerte,136,An amazing meal and overall curated experience.  Many thanks to the staff   including kitchen  garden food sourcing and front of house.
Suerte,137,If you are visiting here  you are only coming for the ambience. Portions are too small and vegetarian options are limited  food is bland so ending my dinner with Nashville hot tofu from velvet taco for a fraction of the price  some real Mexican with good veg options.
Suerte,138,We came here for brunch on a Saturday at 1 30  maybe it s more like lunch at that point  as a group of 3. We noticed right when we got there that the interior was very aesthetically pleasing  with big windows and a great ambiance.  We ordered the famous Suadero Tacos  Chilaquiles  recommended by waiter   Enchiladas with Sweet Potato and Corn  and the Guacamole. Overall  the food was tasty but every dish was a bit too salty for my taste. The Guacamole itself was good  but the chips it came with were really hard and tough to chew. My favorite was definitely the Suadero Tacos  as expected. The Chilaquiles also had a very tasty sauce  though I couldn t eat too much of it because of the saltiness.  I would order the Tacos and maybe the Chilaquiles again  but probably not the rest. Service was very quick and friendly.
Suerte,139,Definitely can customize this restaurant without any hesitation. The prawn sevich is the best I have - sour like most. Suerte tacos are amazing and a must try. The meringue desert is good - not the biggest fan of salty   sweet. The water is amazing and the service is amazing. The bartender is the most friendly.
Suerte,140,Great frozen drink specials during HH  Their frozen penicillin hit the spot.. great flavor  wasn t too sweet and no bitterness at all   Equally as good when it came to their food. Recommend checking out their tacos  salsa dips  homemade tortilla chips    Great vibe and several nearby bars  amp  restaurants to keep you busy  
Suerte,141,Amazing experience  Every bite was perfect  drinks are great. Highly recommended for special occasions or date night 
Suerte,142,So far have only been to brunch at Suerte but my goodness it sure lived up to the hype and more  I can t wait to come back for dinner  We had to start with a pastry because all their pastries and make fresh in house  We went with the apples and cinnamon empanada. Absolutely delicious. I wish I could just swing by for one of those to go on a weekday morning  The brisket tacos are some of the most delicious things I ve ever eaten. Their homemade tortillas take it over the top. I could have gotten two orders of those  The other star of the meal was the chilaquiles. Such great flavor and texture. We also tried the enmoladas because I love mole and they were sooo good. My mouth is water recalling this meal  As for drinks  don t know the nocturna- tequila and cold brew is actually a winning combination  And their Bloody Mary  Suerte Maria  is perfection. Suerte we love you 
Suerte,143,Went here on a recommendation from a colleague. Honestly  it was an okay experience  but not because of anything they could have done. I was just a fan of the menu  not my taste . The environment was great and service outstanding. Just not my style in food. Check it out and it may jive with you more 
Suerte,144,Love Suerte. Very different presentation of Mexican food  some well known dishes with a creative flair.
Suerte,145,The flavors are unique and creative. My favorite was the  suadero tacos. Everything tasted fresh. The Yaupon Spritz cocktail was quite tasty. We also tried the hamachi crudo and quesadilla azul  both were okay. The chocolate tacos for dessert were way to rich and creamy so I wouldn t order that again. The vibe was nice and the service was great.
Suerte,146,Everything about Suerte is perfect  Indoor space  outdoor space  food  service...even the restrooms are beautiful.  The food has so much flavor. Our entire group got something different and it was hard to choose a favorite.  Our waitress was very attentive and friendly.  5 star experience 
Suerte,147,Fantastic restaurant  Had to visit after hearing and reading so many good reviews  100  worth going to. The food is incredible  service is just as good. Don t look further than Suerte  you won t be disappointed. No matter what you pick from the menu  you ll have a good time 
Suerte,148,Went here for brunch with the girls and really enjoyed it. Yummy food and great service  We mentioned we were celebrating an engagement and they brought out a glass of champagne for each of us  Also they were able to split the checks 6 ways and I love when restaurants accommodate this   
Suerte,149,3 seems harsh here  but let me explain my rating system. 5 I love  4 I d go back  3 no complaints  2-1 I had issues. So we are in the  no complaints  camp here. My order rundown   -chips and salsa  4.5 10  chips   1  sauces   8 -pozole  4 10  not my thing  but fine -gnocchi  10 10 loved I will have dreams about -fish tacos  8.5 10 yum  spice from the habies -suadero tacos  7.5 10 rich  nice flavors   First off  let it be known my boyfriend and I had a legit fight about whether or not this was too much food. Our waitress said it was  it wasn t - minimal take home.  The chips were honestly so hard I was nervous I d break a tooth. It was like eating potpourri. My boyfriend said I was being harsh  but I think he d eat potpourri. The salsas and guac made it worth it  so yums.  The pozole I didn t love  but to be honest not my thing so I m a bad critic. Tacos were both yum  but the fish ones were just so crispy and hot - everything I need. My eyes widened when I ate those pillow-y gnocchis though  I loved them so much.  Tl dr nice atmosphere patio setting  true tapas feel with a rolling presentation of food items. Get the gnocchi  skip the chips.
Suerte,150,Best meal in Austin  I am still swooned by our visit here a few weeks ago. The service was phenomenal and the food was outstanding  Our server helped us order the appropriate amount of plates for our party of 2  5-6 plates . We can honestly say we re extremely happy with our selections. I am blown away at the flavor in every dish  every bite. Very authentic  fresh and creative Mexican cuisine. Drinks were good as well. My favorite was the goat barbacoa... it had the most flavor and was very unique and memorable. We ordered apple tart dessert to-go which was decadent. I don t think you can go wrong with any of their desserts or tapas    I didn t get pics of everything we had. I recommend you must try   Refried lentils  amp  yogurt dip  Suadero tacos Goat barbacoa  Pescado  fish  encacahuatado
Suerte,151,Food  mediocre at best.  Price  very high  mushroom flatbread  17 get the idea.  Service  great. Five stars   Come here for drinks most of the time. Sometimes order a couple side dishes and easily  80 for two cocktails and three side dishes. Way too pricy for the taste of food.
Suerte,152,Stumbled upon Suerte randomly when we first moved to ATX. It quickly evolved into a staple we bring visiting friends and families to  showing off a great representation of traditional central Mexican cuisine in classy ambience. Staff is knowledgeable and accommodating. Staple is the asadro tacos and have never been disappointed with anything new on rotation.
Suerte,153,When I want to treat myself to a nice meal and am also craving tacos - Suerte comes to mind. Here you ll find traditional Mexican cooking techniques with local Texas ingredients to create a unique and exciting dining experience.  They are famously known for their Suadero Tacos which are phenomenal. It s made with confit brisket   confit  is a technique used to preserve meats by slow-cooking them in their own fat  this gives it an extra layer of flavor that is to be tasted. Next  they add their Black Magic Oil which is their take on Salsa Macha  a nutty  smokey salsa . Next they put some avocado spread on top and garnish it with some onion and cilantro. Y all know I am team flour tortilla all day too  but these corn tortillas are fantastic  great flavor  great structural integrity.   18   I also asked the server what else was popular and he mentioned the Quesadilla Azul which is made up of chorizo verde  AKA Green Chorizo  this is a bit brighter in taste given it s mixed with tomatillos AKA little tomatoes   cheese  salsa dona  a creamy  herbal green salsa   pumpkin seeds  and pickled veggies all in a blue corn tortilla. Sure  this ain t your greasy  overly cheesey quesadilla  but this is just as good in it s own way. It s packed full of flavor and is a must try for any quesadilla fan     16   For dessert I had to get the Cascara  a dessert they re known for. This is burnt meringue filled with peach cream  peaches  and sweet potato. The contrast here was highly enjoyable because you have this crunchy  hard outside that has a smokey charred flavor and then on the inside  it s the opposite  It s creamy  sweet  refreshing. I highly suggest you try this  too    11   Last  but not least  can t be a nice meal without a nice drink to accompany. I got the Don Dario which has tequila reposado which gives a smooth oak flavor. They mix it with tamarind and sarsaparilla bitters which rounds out the drink. I don t often get tequila based drinks given the bubbly  bright flavor of it  but those 2 ingredients added make it a much more balanced and enjoyable drink.   13 or  8 during HH   Overall  here you ll find an array of complex  yet highly delicious items that are sure to satisfy. At first glance price can be a bit steep  but I assure you - you get what you pay for - not just in quality of the ingredient and cooking methods used  but also in the nice vibrant atmosphere and through great knowledgable service from staff. With that said  Suerte gets a strong 5 5 in my book 
Suerte,154,AMAZING dinner from start to finish. I ve been twice and have been so impressed each time. Drinks are fresh  flavorful  and substantial. The menu is small but full of a variety of options to please every palate. While the food is meant to be shared within your group  the portion are large enough to where you can order your own entree. My friends and I ordered the quesadilla  the brisket tacos  the sweet corn  the sweet potatoes  and the lentils -- no complaints  only praise. Everything was phenomenal. Great service too    It has more of an upscale vibe  so I would say it s a great place for date night or a fun night out with friends. I would suggest this place if you re looking for Mexican food but want something different and a little bit more upscale than the typical  tex-mex  you ll find in Austin and throughout Texas.
Suerte,155,Get the suadero tacos  You won t be disappointed  La michi was the perfect drink to go with them.
Suerte,156,Suerte is our go to when we have friends or family in town. The contemporary boho decor mixed with elevated Mexican cuisine always makes for a great night out. The brisket tacos are to die for  A must have  otherwise play around and try different things. You won t be disappointed.
Suerte,157,Always amazing but please have your staff remember happy hour prices please and thank you  It s kind of been a hassle reminding them each time.
Suerte,158,It was a wonderful experience. My husband and I had reservations for 6pm for outside seating but it was so hot that we got there at 5 00 to see if we could wait and get an inside table. They said yes  if we didn t mind sitting at the bar  so we agreed.   The bartender  Lyle  was amazing. I had a virgin Bloody Mary that was the absolute best  he said they made everything there  including the tomato juice from fresh tomatoes .  The guacamole was perfect and they were served with large tostada chips  yum. I had the tamal en mole blanco  vegetarian   and my husband had the ribeye  which was on their specials menu. Both were amazing.   One of the waitstaff  we had several  all very nice  told us they heard from the bartender that it was our anniversary  so they let us choose a free dessert  which was a great surprise. We chose the carrot tres leche. The top part with the cream cheese was yummy but the sponge cake was a little soggy. It still had a good flavor. It was pricey but worth it.
Suerte,159,To be honest it s not what it s looks. La comida s per cara y para colmo no est  tan rica que digamos. Solo por que sali  en Netflix se dan el lujo de cobrar as  de caro
Suerte,160,Had a lovely dinner. Called because there were no reservations online. The host ensured they keep a certain amount of tables for walk in customers and encouraged us to come over - as long as we didn t mind a little wait. We sat immediately on the patio  30 min wait for the dining room . Had a Rosa peligrosa cocktail  pictured . Chiltomate dip  short rib quesadilla  pan seared tile fish and the squash side. Such a lovely dinner and we would definitely return.
Suerte,161, I don t think I could ever hit that level of dopamine again  without using drugs  - my fianc  about the tacos.   We got the suerdo tacos  the guacamole  and the Don something margaritas.  Everything was so delish   My fianc  is in love with the place  been here numerous times  took me here tonight. So full but the food is so good I could have more.   Didn t wait long for a table at 10pm on a Saturday night.   Water is like room temp and I don t know why that was so refreshing.   Chill vibes. Delicious food.
Suerte,162,Definitely have to say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in Austin. You can t go wrong with the suadero tacos and the black magic oil that s put on top of it. Also loved their Lengua Hash. So flavorful and tender. I ve only gone during brunch but can t wait to try what s on their dinner menu.
Suerte,163,Incredible atmosphere  drinks  and food. Lines will be long for this eatery so come early and drop your name on the list. You can walk around East Austin while waiting for a great experience. My wife and I will be back to work our way down the menu   
Suerte,164,Suerte was enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was airy and light. We ordered a lot of food and everything came out quickly.   The food itself was delicious. We ordered the quesadilla  pupusa  tacos  and chilaquiles. It was a well crafted menu  and very unique.  However  the food was rather pricey with small portions. It tasted great  but everyone at the table left hungry.  I would recommend this place to out of towners looking for a unique bite who don t mind spending a little more on occasion.
Suerte,165,Let me preface this review by stating that I came here for the goat barbacoa and the carrot tres leches cake. I specifically chose to dine here because I ve never see those dishes being offered anywhere else and I seek out unique menu items when I pick which restaurants to go to.   Came early for dinner  around 5pm  to snag a table for two without a reservation and catch the last hour of  Lucky Hour . This place was packed  make a reservation ahead of time or come early. Ordered the Don Dario and Nada Paloma for drinks. Both great  Nada Paloma was sweet while the Don Dario was bitter tart. Food ordered off the lucky hour menu were Pollo Tacos and the Guacamole. Tacos were average  good but nothing amazing. Sauce was creamy and spicy. The guacamole really satisfied the appetizer craving. The fresh out of the fryer gigantic chips were amazing.   Goat barbacoa was so juicy and succulent. Crispy bits and fatty pieces intertwined. Best of both worlds. Imagine brisket but a but gamey. A bit greasy and messy to eat but worth it. Fresh masa tortillas paired with punchy sauces and a scoop of meat  perfection.   Carrot tres leches. As an adventurous dessert person  I loved the ingenuity of the dessert. Crisp carrot curls on top  tangy cream  tart drizzle  half soaked sponge with a slight savory element. One bite contained a whirlwind of flavors and textures. It was confusing all together but separating the cake from the cream made it as if it was two desserts. Sweet light milk soaked cake and tangy cream with crispy bits. I think the passionfruit drizzle was the one element that threw the overall flavor of the dessert off. Definitely takes an acquired taste to be enjoyed but excellent execution and very original dessert offering.
Suerte,166,Delicious food in an upbeat atmosphere. Great for dinner with friends or a romantic setting. Apps  main course  and dessert are amazing. Get them all. Service on top of everything is a notch above.
Suerte,167,I absolutely loved dining at Suerte   Very cool vibe  modern upscale but definitely not snobby. All the dishes we tried were great  the only thing we weren t wild about were the cocktails but maybe we just didn t order the right ones. Also the texture of the okra wasn t for me  very slimy inside  but my boyfriend loved them so so with that info what you will.  Our server went above and beyond in terms of service and it really made our experience all the better. Would definitely recommend.
Suerte,168,I ate at Suerte with a large group so we had a set menu with a little of everything on the menu. Every single dish from the guacamole and masa tortillas to the wagyu steak was so AMAZING    I highly recommend the short rib tacos  mushroom tacos  roasted sweet potato   amp  wagyu. Even the desserts were great 
Suerte,169,Best food in Austin so far  Given the quality of the food  the price is very affordable. There was no dish I didn t like. Every dish is beyond expectation 
Suerte,170,Omg the suadero tacos were so soooo good  I m definitely coming back for more  The quesadilla and the chilaquiles were also really good  10 10 food.
Suerte,171,This place was very confusing. I ordered Goat barbacoa which was okay. It was wrapped in like a green tamale husk. The reason I say confusing is because the menu was hard to understand. There weren t many choices. The drink with Mezcal was super delicious. My friends and I ordered guacamole which was good. It had nuts in it and it did have a good flavor. The tortillas were yummy.
Suerte,172,5 stars for food and drinks. 1 star for service. I ve never met a bunch of wait staff that was more pretentious and rude. We were not a difficult group and were made to feel totally overbearing and unwelcome. It s unfortunate because the food truly does shine. Hopefully they can get leadership in front of house that can help them check their over inflated egos.
Suerte,173,the food was outstanding as always  the manager Ian went above and beyond to correct something for us and it made the experience that much more memorable. looking forward to our next visit 
Suerte,174,There s been a lot of hype about this place  and getting a reservation is tough. But I have to say we weren t that impressed. The wagyu tacos were more like roast beef  the monkfish was fishy and the overpriced drinks were  ok.  They do have a ton of waitstaff who are very attentive  but otherwise we were underwhelmed.
Suerte,175,Absolutely incredible culinary experience. Super hip and upscale vibe with such a knowledgeable waitstaff. The cocktails are good but nothing to write home about.
Suerte,176,I will never forget this meal. I grew up in Mexico and have had some amazing Mexican food... and I think this might be the best Mexican food I have ever had in the US. The masa tortillas here are simple and perfect  the meat was tender and well seasoned  and the FLAVORS give homage to the classics and then push it juuust enough into being creative and different and beautiful. Yes  ok  this place is expensive  brunchy  trendy and all that jazz  but WOW this food is special.
Suerte,177,A great place to visit. Good has beautiful flavor and complexity  great service   We made a reservation a while back for brunch needed to add more people the day before and they accommodated us graciously. The wait staff was knowledgeable and made good recommendation. Service is prompt and smooth.  We tried the famous suadero tacos-- very good  The portion  the fresh tortilla  guac  really compliment the meat that is crispy and tender at the same time-  I d eat it again.  Este carpaccio was really good as well  refreshing and has many layers of flavors and texture  a good appetizer to get your juice goin  for da meat    Enchilada was pretty good  beef shank was alright. Didn t blow my mind but in general this is a great place to visit. I love the vibe and the decor.
Suerte,178,How good can taco be  Really  I mean... you would think there is some equality among the top tier. But  no. Suerte created a new tier. Each part of their taco is superb  mas masa  por favor   but it is the sum that makes it unforgettable. Add great service  great location  great ambience and decor to round out a truly 5 star experience.
Suerte,179,I am in Austin for business meetings and one my clients suggested my date and I dine at Suerte.  He also suggested that we make reservations fast as they tend to get busy during dinner hours.  I was able to make my reservations at 9 pm and before dinner we walked around and did a little bar hopping as we waited for the hostess text me to let me know our table was ready.  Chris our waiter was super cool and suggested our dining options for the night. For starters we had massive chips with guacamole and flight of salsas.  For dinner Cris suggested we share so we decided suadero tacos and pollo carbon.  The tacos shells are made in-house and were perfect street size tacos.  We sipped cava with our meals and I also had their house margarita which was perfect.  To round our a perfect evening we shared a house made choco taco which was amazing.  Chris service and suggestions were on point and made it a great evening.  After dinner we went on an adventure of finding the speak easy  and was only allowed in if we provide them the password.
Suerte,180,Food is good. Atmosphere is swanky casual. Upscale Mexican. Menu is difficult to figure out  but everything tasted great.  Margaritas are also on point. Guac is from your dreams.
Suerte,181,Excellent experience and attention to detail. The food tastes of high quality and the dishes are arranged with interesting flavor combinations.   I tried the guacamole dip for starters which came with corn chips. This dip was to die for and will be my last meal should I ever end up having to choose one. The tamales and brisket tacos also rocked    I tried a couple of the cocktails - both of which were also memorable. The Caskey Sour and the El Viejo were my poison. The El Viejo is most decidedly the love child of an Old Fashioned and a Negroni. The Caskey Sour just watched.
Suerte,182,Setting  2 people  indoor seating  9 pm on a Friday  Atmosphere  hip atmosphere  you can tell it s going to be delicious when you enter  lots of small groups of adults sharing tapas  spread out tables so conversations are easy  service is great and helpful  Beverages  we got a few of these and loved all of ours  my favorite was their version of a margarita   Food  We ordered many different dishes and shared  we got   5 items and we were super hungry before  4 probably would have been sufficient for 2 people. Between the two of us we got Fish Tacos  4 5   brisket Tacos  5 5  these are incredibly flavorful  yet simple   tuna tostada  4 5   and sweet potatoes  5 5  would give 6 5 if possible  this was truly a unique tasting  wonderfully done sweet potato  the lime juice on it was absolute perfection and an interesting combination I hadn t had before   and one more thing off the snack menu which I don t recall the name of    Overall  5 stars not only for the delicious food and tasty drinks but I loved the atmosphere  would be great for a date or small groups  just make sure it s a group that you don t mind sharing food with as that s the funnest part is trying a bit of everything. Definitely will come again next time I m in Austin     pro tip books out early  make reservations a few weeks out if possible
Suerte,183,I had a great time here when I was visiting my friends. The servers and staff were really helpful with recommending suggestions on what dishes to choose and being overall friendly. Portions are generally smaller and meant to be shared  so think tapas. I would come back here again.
Suerte,184,AMAZING LITTLE PLACE. Our waiter  Ryan  was fantastic   Friendly  knowledgeable  and very attentive...  We got the lengua hash and the verde chilequiles-  both were equally amazing. The dishes were flavorful and fresh and the portions were a good size  leaving plenty of room for a delightful strawberry empanada with a ginger-pi a glaze.  The restaurant itself was very urban and modern and not at all what you would expect from the outside  the street it is on is a little sketchy  but i absolutely loved the vibe. We will definitely be back if we re ever in Austin again 
Suerte,185,Great upscale Mexican place on the east side. Service was excellent  great wine list  interesting menu. We had the calabaza dip  goat barbacoa   amp  suadero tacos... all delicious. Also was impressed with how well they handled allergies  very gluten-free friendly.
Suerte,186,I was expecting a bit more from this place. The masa was delicious but the rest was a bit too greasy missing something acid to balance out. Our server told us to order many dishes as they were  small  plates according to him. Don t do it. One plate per person is more than enough since it was pretty heavy.
Suerte,187,Enjoyed a Saturday lunch session here. The authentic Mexican menu items really set this place apart. Certainly not your average Mexican spot - in terms of food and price. We ordered guacamole and chips with an additional small tomatillo sauce and found later that we were charged  5 for it... expect to pay a premium for the fresher ingredients  their price points are above average for the food quantity   quality.
Suerte,188,Had to check out this place after watching the Netflix  taco show  The famous Suadero tacos was so good  it looks small but has hefty amount of meat and guacamole and it was very satisfying. The menu looks smaller but seems like the chefs got new things coming so it s worth checking out time to time to see what s new 
Suerte,189,Great food and even better service. A total gem. We will be back. The dining experience was very nice  we shared a great dinner.
Suerte,190,My husband and I were in town for the long weekend and had dinner at Suerte on Sunday night. Ambiance of the restaurant is cool and very laid back and our server was very nice and super helpful with ordering suggestions. We ordered the calabaza dip  quesadilla de res  suadero tacos  chicken pipiripau and the peaches y feta. The only dish that we didn t love was the quesadilla. The tortilla tasted burned and the cheese texture was almost grainy. That was the only dish that we were not impressed by though. The suadero tacos are insane  there is a reason that every review talks about them   I also highly recommend the peaches and feta  the dish was so so fresh and delicious. My only regret was that they came last and I was too full to finish them. Loved this restaurant and wish they would open shop in Houston 
Suerte,191,Suerte is excellent- fresh dishes  cordial waitstaff  and an understated aesthetic.   As many have said  the suadero tacos are very tasty  but I usually find something else on the menu that I end up enjoying even more. The fish tacos and aguachile are two standouts.   Will continue to return 
Suerte,192,Updating this to say that it is still as delicious as the first time. Major kudos to our server Johnathan for being one of the best waiters I ve ever had and for making my birthday dinner so special 
Suerte,193,If there were more stars we would give it even higher. Cocktails were excellent. Service was great. Our appetizer was a little slow coming out so the server took it off the tab. Not necessary at all but this place holds itself to a high bar.  The food was fantastic.  Specifically the barbacoa was one of the best meals we have ever eaten.  Highly recommend.  Great atmosphere. We will be back.
Suerte,194,We do like to visit Suerte for happy hour. Drinks are refreshing and the appetizers are a good bargain  Beef Chamorro Taquitos . This time  my husband ordered the Suadero tacos  actually  again. 4 mini corn tortilla tacos with tender morsels of beef and that black magic oil. I had the Huarrache chicken dish. Imagine a corn mass flatbread with smoked chicken garnished with salsa Verde and basil. Service is good. My main complaint is their over use of salt. Everything was overdone with salt. Each time we have come  I have noticed that salt is prominent in their dishes  should perhaps remake the restaurant   Suerte con Sal  .
Suerte,195,Suerte is dining perfection from the flavors to the plating of dishes including the overall vibe and the soundtrack of music   Pete was an exceptional server during yesterday s brunch on the patio  weaving the description of each dish we considered into a story of flavor and sensation  then pacing their delivery to meet our relaxed schedule and heightened palate. There s a reason we have eaten here during every visit to town since the first month they opened. Hopefully a pandemic won t keep us away as long. See you soon Suerte 
Suerte,196,FOOD gets a 5 star review. My 1 star is based on the service I received tonight with my mom and sister. Our waitress was EDNA. She was VERY unprofessional. The staff that brought out our drinks and food were wonderful they were smiling and actually displayed amazing customer service. I noticed how Edna actually took the time to talk to the tables near us and asked if it was their first time etc and never even tried to make conversation with my family and I. Very rude and distasteful. Unfortunately  I do not think I will be returning.
Suerte,197,Nada Paloma  5 5    12  Smokey Vodka Grapefruit. Tasty and strong. Money s worth. El Burro  5 5    12  Spicy Moscow Mule Drink. Creative  tasty  and strong. Also money s worth here.  Suadero  5 5    14  4 small tortilla piled sky high with amazing brisket that was good ratio of fat  and awesome flavors.  Avocado crudo  was a cute name for basically chunky guacamole. Definitely order this. Campechano  4 5    12  4 small tortillas with carnitas mixed with chorizo. Good flavor and probably would have been rated higher if we ate this one first. The suadero just set the bar extremely high. Coctel Verde  2.5 5    15  I think this was their attempt at a ceviche. Shrimp is chopped up and poached as opposed to vinegar cooked. The flavor was on the bitter side  maybe the celery   and not quite what I was looking for. It was pretty  but that was about it.  Tres Leches  4.5 5    8  What I would expect in a tres leches cake. The cream on top was actually my favorite part. The cake itself was a tad bit too sweet for me but still would order again. Still thinking about that cream.  tl dr  Great drinks  and phenomenal suadero tacos. Little disappointed by their take on ceviche but their tres leches was a strong save. Service was good and the prices fair. Recommend 
Suerte,198,Wow  this place was great  We made our reservation weeks ahead  which was necessary. People just walking in were told there s a 2 1 2 hour wait. And that was a weeknight.  The food was all fantastic. There was a sunchoke special that was amazing. The potato chorizo appetizer and tuna tostada appetizer both delicious. Quesadilla awesome. Brisket tacos and fish tacos also sooo good  but beware  those fish tacos have a habenero oil on them and they are HOT  Flan for dessert was one the best flans I ve ever had. The only thing we all were a bit disappointed with was the guacamole. It was ok   especially because their chips are great  but just nothing special. But overall  a great food night. Go with a few people and share. Would absolutely return.
Suerte,199,THE BEST BRISKET TACO I VE HAD  Do yourself a favor and order the suadero tacos and the goat barbacoa. The they are both very tenderly cooked and super tasty. The drinks are good too. I had a mezcal Paloma that was sweet and smoky and just plain good. And don t skip dessert  The cascara is a must.
Suerte,200,From the moment we walked in and snagged the last two open spots at the bar  we were in the hands of food experience aficionados - and well taken care of.  Despite the bar being slammed  the bartender was attentive  friendly  and totally top notch. Drinks to die for  same goes for the food. The place was hopping and high energy. Great experience. Can t wait to get back.
Suerte,201,They are known for those tacos for a reason  So good. Our service was great and the food was amazing. There were out of about 4 menu items but our waiter let us know before we ordered.
Suerte,202,Absolutely blown away by this meal. We are  foodies  and have been privileged to visit some of the greatest restaurants. Suerte is a new one towards the top of our list. From the ambience  specialized service  cocktails  and food  it was a divine experience.   All of the flavor profiles were layered  amp  experimental but made sense and just worked. Highly recommend the brisket tacos  gauc  the ceviche  chicken finished off with the cascara.   We joked  but in all seriousness  we d come back to Austin just to visit Suerte again   
Suerte,203,This place is incredible. Love how the menu changes so frequently  and the staff is so knowledgeable. Any of their fish dishes are incredible  and the Suaderos tacos are a must  the only menu item they always keep .
Suerte,204,Good food  not good service. Our server was very rude and made very passive aggressive remarks. We wanted dessert and he dropped off the check without even asking if we were interested in dessert. Mind you  dessert is on their menu. We would ve loved to tip high as we were in town for a work trip and all come from customer service. The only polite person we had was the girl with shaved sides and pink hair. Loved her. Food was good but mood was off thanks to our server.
Suerte,205,Suerte had a great ambiance and the food was just as good. As an upscale spot  the portions are quite small and pricey  but the food is still great You most likely have to order about 2 entrees and an appetizer to really leave satisfied. Suerte also has an extensive selection of alcohol  with a specialty in Mezcal Tequila. I got a 3oz poor of mezcal - pretty strong but great stuff.   If you happen to eat here  I would suggest the Mezcal  Guacamole Con Macha Verde  and Grilled Pork Chop 
Suerte,206,We sat outside on the front patio and it was an absolute joy on a sunny day. They went above and beyond to look up a gift card I d received from work but lost the email record. The manager ended up finding it after searching by email  name  date  and sender.   We had several beverages  both alcoholic and not  all were fantastic. The salsas  chips  tortillas and basically all masa-based food items were delectable. I cannot wait to return to such a wonderful restaurant.
Suerte,207,Atmosphere was 10 10. Our waiter Jonathan was so sweet and fun and had great recommendations for the menu. Everything we got was so good and very unique. It s not just a normal Mexican restaurant which is so fun. Def would recommend 
Suerte,208,I ll admit I wasn t a huge fan when a big group of us dined here and sampled a variety of appetizers and entrees. For me  most was just okay.  However  a friend  amp  I just ordered their brisket taco dinner and margarita kit to go  and that experience was fantastic  They provided a video link for how to prepare the meal as well as drink recipe instructions  and both cane out great  and neither of us are experienced cooks .  Highly recommend ordering the brisket tacos  kale salad  and beans through their current dine-at-home kit  and once normal restaurant hours life resumes  I ll dine in again just for those tacos 
Suerte,209,Avoid this joint.  The handful folks that follow my reviews already know I maintain a 2-1 positive to negative review ratio.  So  only my worst experiences get 3 or below.  If I could give negative stars  then I would.   The food needs less work than the staff  but the food needs a lot of work.  As for the staff  well  they need to shut the place down and retrain.  When one has such a bad experience with staff you might also think there are leadership issues.  I live downtown and I walk to most places.  So  I guess my khakis and collared golf shirts  work for comfort in the Texas heat  don t fit Suerte s image of their ideal customer.  The Suerte team is incredibly rude if you do not fit the mold -- not a recipe for success in Austin  or in life .  So  please avoid if you are part of a marginalized class  because Suerte will remind you.
Suerte,210,Came here for brunch dinner. Thought the food was just ok but the tres leches dessert was delicious.   Food  Salmon tostada - ok Tacos - ok  Tres leches - delish Churros - ok
Suerte,211,JJ is a knowledgeable  attentive  and humorous server  The food was amazing but I would come back just for JJ 
Suerte,212,This restaurant lives up to the hype 100 . We ve had Mexican food from all over  and it s obvious this food is cooked with passion for beauty  authenticity  and above all- FLAVOR  So palette pleasing. The food and service are superbly satisfying. Also the peach dessert we had is something I still think about. I don t think about desserts often but this one was truly unique. Like a creme br l e but with meringue as the hard shell. Didn t get a pic of it because it was my birthday and I was too busy enjoying it. Highly recommend 
Suerte,213,If you re going to sample some modern Mexican flair  it might as well be in Austin. Enter Suerte - which reminded me of a less pretentious Cosme back in NYC. As modern Mexican goes  it s a bit pricey  but damn tasty and well-executed.  As it was just me and my bud  we ended up sharing an app and 2 entrees. And those were   Suadero Tacos  confit brisket  black magic oil  avocado salsa cruda - brisket  avocado salsa...sign me up any day  4 plump  mini-tacos to a serving  amply coated avocado goodness   Goat Barbacoa with green garlic salsa  pico  chile cascabel salsa  bean pur e  tortillas - wow. Succulent goat served up in a banana leaf with an assortment salsa and plenty of tortillas to assist with getting that rich meaty goodness to your belly.  Duck Breast Y Mole  served with fennel masa dumplings  crispy duck skin  and tortillas. Succulent duck  perfectly crispy skin  a deep  intense mole...and more torillas for plate to face assistance. Glorious.  With solid day s worth of indulgence at St. Elmo s and Jester King  we opted to forego dessert  but I hope there s a next time for that. And I would have to say that  throughout the meal  the service was solid and attentive.  Suerte can be considered a little pricey  but the ingredients  attention to detail  and execution make it all worth while.
Suerte,214,It was ok. Upscale Mexican. Nothing to write home about. Service was decent but there were times we were wanting a drink refill and had to wait a little. No biggie. It was all decent.
Suerte,215,Came here with some friends when in Austin for ACL  we unanimously agreed that the food was excellent. The beef tacos are absolute winners. We ate some other things that were all excellent but I can t remember what they were  we opened a few bottles of champagne at the AirBnB before going for brunch and my memory was slightly impaired . We also had drinks  I can t really remember the name of what we had  some pink cocktails  but they were also really good. I m adding this place to my Austin collection
Suerte,216,The waiter introduced the restaurant as a traditional mexican fare. I probably wouldn t call it that. This place had a wide variety of choices along with awesome flavors. Service was great  The suadero tacos are excellent with perfectly cooked meat. My favorites were the black bean and the goat dish. Great place to take vegans 
Suerte,217,Two words. Suadero Tacos   These are probably the best tacos I have had in my life. They cook this beef in tallo and the outside is crispy and the inside is like butter. I am not usually a huge taco fan but I loved this place. The trio of salsas was fantastic. The chips that you break off is such a nice touch. This was an amazing Austin dining experience for me and I cannot wait to go back to try some other items.  So I suggest you stop what you are doing right now and go to Suerte and get the Suadero Tacos 
Suerte,218,From drinks to food  everything is fantastic  such yumminess  I will definitely be returning to try something different. The tacos are perfect  The appetizer was described as a Mexican hummus and it is soooo delicious 
Suerte,219,I m glad I stopped here for my first dinner in Austin. I highly recommend stopping by here as the food and service are excellent. In addition  this restaurant offers outdoor seating which is a plus given Covid. I was a solo diner who ordered the hibiscus snapper crudo  suadero tacos and one of the specials  pozole. While this place is pricey  I def recommend stopping by 
Suerte,220,Suerte was my favorite meal in my recent trip to Austin. Every dish features masa  which they make in house. We ordered about 10 dishes between four people  and we probably could have ordered more  but calories  ya know.  Dishes we ordered  - chips w refried lentils  amp  yogurt - chorizo molotes w avocado crema - suadero tacos  fav dish  - tostada mixta  a hit amongst the table  - chamorro taquitos  other big hit  - quesadilla  - tlacoyo - duck breast y mole - grilled sweet potatos - grilled veggies   My top three favorites were the suadero tacos w confit brisket and black magic oil  it s crack   the tostada mixta  bf s fav    amp  the chamorro taquitos  smoked beef shank . Yea  there s a lot of beef. I don t typically eat beef but this meal was beyond delicious.  The best part of the meal was when we told our server we were going to skip dessert to go on a mission for bananarchy  a food truck that serves frozen bananas   he was like   you re going all the way over there for a banana    Everyone cracked up.  If you come to Austin  you must visit Suerte.
Suerte,221,Absolutely adorable inside  You can tell that this place has Mexican and Peruvian flair once you step inside. It is very modern  yet it has culture of the Mexican patterns framed on the wall. We had a reservation  it was very late because that is all they had  but we took it. We sat down and were greeted promptly by our server and some water. We ordered the tamarind margarita  called the Don Dario.   It was absolutely delicious  We ordered chorizo for appetizers  empanadas   and the brisket tacos as well as the sweet potato. For dessert  we ordered of the Choco loco. This desert is a not to miss  It has sesame seeds inside which you would not even imagine would go with chocolate. It gave a slightly salty flavor and a crunch.   Overall  I probably would not come back here because the menu is not very large but if they change the menu I would come back a second time. I think that this place is a don t miss though  it is a great ambience and the food was very yummy  Unfortunately  I do not like goat or duck  so that really limited the menu for me. I would say make the reservation And go see for yourself 
Suerte,222,My boyfriend and I had the best experience at Suerte. Our server San Juan was awesome and took great care of us  We ordered the Rainbow Concha  Smoked Salmon Tostada  and the Suadero Tacos. Everything was delicious we definitely recommend.
Suerte,223,I was so looking forward to my post-race brunch here and it did NOT disappoint   My brother and I ran a half marathon this morning and he made a brunch res here for us after as he had always wanted to try this place.   Though we were over 20min late  they were so accommodating for us and still seated us right away. The restaurant is sizable and so cutely decorated  it was clear right away that this is a popular spot as it was packed at 11 30. Our server was amazing and constantly filled our waters  provided amazing recommendations  and was just so warm and friendly throughout.   After much deliberation  we ordered the spritzes for our cocktails  which were super refreshing after our long runs  We then ordered the peach coffee cake and strawberry queso roll which were both so unique and delicious. We started off with the winter greens salad  the  grilled doblano  quesadilla  carnitas tacos  duck confit flautas  and pozole. I absolutely loved the flautas  the mole was absolutely amazIng. The doblano was delicIous as well  and every dish had their amazing tortillas in them. Their tortillas are definitely different and very unique  not sure how they made them  but their texture  thickness  and flavor were amazing. Every dish was seasoned to perfection and I loved the spice in the quesadilla  whcih sounds like a basic dish  but literally every dish of theirs has a unique twist that makes this place the modern Mexican place it aims to be   Everything was absolutely amazing and worth getting. Everything was brought out quickly and was super fresh as they source everything locally. Highly recommend a brunch visit 
Suerte,224,Suerte was PHENOMENAL   We highly recommend. We got the brisket tacos and the gnocchi. The brisket was delicious and the gnocchi was unique. We are happy we ordered both. Friends got the tuna tostado and said it  was very fresh and flavorful. They also highly recommended the chips. One note  we got palomas and don dario drinks. No one at the table liked either of the drinks. The palomas tasted like cucumber and the don Dario was not what we were expecting when we asked our waiter what was most similar to a house marg. I would try different drinks  or not drink at all  but the food was definitely worth going back. I understand why it s considered one of the best restaurants in Austin 
Suerte,225,Come here for the suaderos tacos and the gorgeous space.   I was immediately blown away by the interior when I stepped in - I love the airy  bright design  and the greenery outside - it almost makes you forget you re in Austin rather than Southern California.  Food wise we got   Squash tacos - Solid tacos  but the real star here is the salsa which is refreshing and flavorful.   Suadero tacos - They re known for this for a reason. Really tender beef and creamy avocado  paired with their signature corn tortilla. The corn tortilla is thicker than a normal corn tortilla  and all made in house  but it works really well with the suadero tacos by balancing against the rich beef. My friend who s not usually a fan of corn tortillas remarked how much she liked this tortilla.  Carrot cake tres leches - It s not on their brunch menu but if you ask  they can make it for you. Don t sleep on this - love the dried carrot shaving topping paired with the cream cheese and carrot cake.   We also got the pupusa  well executed and a big fan of the sauce  although a bit heavy for me with all the other dishes   salmon tostada  tasty with a bit of spice   and kolache  not a huge fan of this type of pastry I think . Overall a lovely brunch experience and worth seeking out.
Suerte,226,SWEET NECTAR OF THE GODS  I am not ashamed to admit the alarming frequency that the suadero tacos show up in my dreams. I desperately wish slow motion existed in real life so I could savor each bite even more. Midway through dinner we felt it necessary to call the fire department and alert them of the continuous explosion of flavor in our mouths. It was both dangerous and delicious.   Let s move onto the margaritas. They re JUST like a four loco  except 3 million times less shitty. Absolutely tantalizing. Even the glasses the margaritas were in were awesome. We thought about stealing one  but knew we couldn t disrespect the house of the suadero tacos like that.   If you have not yet been to Suerte  please call us and we will book you a flight to Austin and make a reservation  then feed you the tacos ourselves. Seriously go there immediately.
Suerte,227,Best high end Tex Mex in town. Their Suadero brisket  tacos are some of the best I ve ever had. They also have great options for takeout  like  Tacos by the Pint   which comes with a pint of taco meat of your choice  their handmade corn tortillas and salsa.   If like Tequila and or Mezcal  this place also has an amazing selection of both  and if you go during Happy Hour  4pm-5 39pm daily   you get 25  off.   It might be a little pricey to go to regularly  but if you get a chance to visit  I highly recommend it 
Suerte,228,Vegetarian review -- We saw this restaurant on Taco Chronicles and decided to go for my boyfriends birthday last night. So FREAKING good.   I ate     REFRIED LENTILS Y YOGURT - perfectly salty and delicious. We tore through this with the giant tortilla chips.   MUSHROOM CASUELITA - the mole is divine    The tortillas are so fluffy and perfect.   Cocktails were authentic and food is all so good. You won t regret a night here
Suerte,229,This is a fun spot perfect for old friends or a dinner date with a young but not obnoxious crowd. The food is light  refreshing  and delicious. I was also introduced to some new flavors from your standard Mexican fare. For two people we ordered   AGUACHILE  16 royal red prawns  coconut lime broth  avocado  red onion  TOSTADA MIXTA  15 poached shrimp  octopus  amp  mussels  avocado  chile cascabel salsa  aioli  jalape os  SUADERO TACOS  17 confit brisket  black magic oil  avocado salsa cruda  The first two  Frio  amp  Raw  dishes had some similar ingredients although different flavors. I probably would just pick one if I returned. The citrus in the tostada mixta reminded me of the perfect ceviche. Notably the aguachile has raw prawns while the shrimp in the tostada are cooked. Finally the suadero taco was a delicious 2-biter. You can really tell they make the tortillas in house. I tried to get the black magic oil recipe from the waiter but all he would disclose were fermented Chinese black beans  For drinks I got a local beer - the Rosa  a raspberry sour from St. Elmo Brewing. It paired well with the seafood and fruity flavors.   I highly recommend making reservations as it was crowded. Free valet parking. Don t forget to tip 
Suerte,230,I love Suerte. The food  the service  the vibe. It s always great and the menu is always exciting. These guys know how to run a restaurant and give you a great experience. I came just before the New Year  2022 . Our server was the best  he gave us free tequila shots  Lalo  before we left and took care of us with excellent recommendations. You definitely have to book in advance  this place is highly coveted
Suerte,231,Another excellent experience at Suerte  Our server  Sanjuan  was phenomenal  He truly made the dining experience enjoyable with his expertise about the food and his superb recommendations and food descriptions. He worked with the kitchen to customize a menu for my husband and me based on our food allergies  and went above and beyond in all aspects of our experience   I highly recommend the tlayuda de hongos  which is one of the most decadent and perfectly-balanced dishes I ve ever tasted  The quesadilla de res was also one of my favorite dishes at Suerte. I was also pleasantly surprised by the addition of several mezcal house cocktails to the menu. Out of all the times we ve dined at Suerte  this has by far been my favorite. I can t wait to go back for my birthday next month.
Suerte,232,Great vibe with excellent service. The food was remarkably good. We loved the Suadero Tacos -- must have. Cocktails also right on point. Would definitely come back if we visit austin again.
Suerte,233,Disclaimer--My  first visit to Suerte was due to a generous gift card from friends who appreciate my and my husband s love of all things food. The courses are meant to be shared  so a great place to go with friends to sample several things on the menu. My favorite dish of the evening was for sure the Suadero Tacos.  The brisket was amazing in every way.  If you are not a big red meat person  which I m not  but when in Rome   then I also highly recommend the Fish a la Devil.   Parking  they do have a complimentary valet  so don t  spend your time aimlessly searching for parking or wasting money on meters or the parking garage across the street.  Sappy note  This was our first sit-down restaurant of the decade  so it will always have a special place in our hearts.
Suerte,234,While staying at ARRIVE we were given a list of popular places near our hotel and Suerte was one of the restaurants on the list. So  we gave it a try and actually ate here twice while in Austin. Walking distance  Suerte was maybe 2 minutes from our hotel which was awesome  We didn t have a reservation so the wait time was pretty long but worth the wait. We ordered   Suadero tacos Guacamole  Goat barbacoa Don Dario  cocktail   Excellent restaurant vibes  friendly service  and GREAT food  Definitely hope to come back 
Suerte,235,We dined at Suerte on a Sunday evening and absolutely loved our experience. Our server Ian was very knowledgeable and offered suggestions for shareable dishes  which was just what we were looking for  and everything we ate was better than the last. Highly recommend 
Suerte,236,I had been here for drinks and dessert before  but somehow hadn t made it for dinner. It s been bookmarked for a year  but there never seems to be enough time to hit up every place I want to go. I m glad I finally made the time. I decided to take my boyfriend here for his birthday. He s not a fancy type  but hey  if I m paying  we are going to have a great food experience.   We started with the crispy potatoes and the mixed seafood tostada. The seafood was abundant   Octopus  mussels  shrimp  and some veggies in a tomato based  sauce. Fantastic   The potatoes were fluffy  with crisped skin and served over a tasty sauce  romesco    and seasoned well and had a generous dusting of cheese.   The braised brisket tacos were a must try and my favorite dish of the evening. Que sabor   You get four with each order and the avocado based salsa rounds out the flavors. Next up  we shared the green Chile tamal. I can t rave enough about the masa here   The perfect texture and flavor and  while this wasn t a traditional tamal  it was fantastic  spicy  flavorful and amazingly good.   Our final course  which we couldn t finish because we were stuffed  was the red fish. Served with tortillas  onions  salsa and veggies  it was delicious  even eaten cold the next day.   I highly recommend Suerte and am eager to go back and try a few new things. Bravo 
Suerte,237,Good food  wonderful service  not all that I thought it would be.   Maybe I ordered wrong but there was way too much guacamole on everything.  The famous tacos seemed overwhelmed by the citrus in the guacamole  overall I was a little disappointed but just because there are so many other really great food choices in Austin.  I m glad we tried it  won t be back
Suerte,238,Definitely pricey  but the happy hour made it better. They had half priced drinks and 25  off wine by the bottle. We had the guacamole  the brisket tacos  the white mole  the ceviche  and the sweet potatoes. The tacos with the magic oil were phenomenal  You can buy the magic oil to take home  and I wish I had. Really  everything was super delicious  even the sweet potatoes. The white mole tamale was creamy and cake like  which was unexpected. Plates are small and for the price tag  probably won t be in the regular rotation  but definitely will be back at some point.
Suerte,239,Delicious food  allergy friendly options  beautiful environment  and great service.  The suadero tacos and salmon tostada were our favorites.
Suerte,240,I really think we did a bad job of ordering. We didn t make reservations at first on a Saturday night then didn t end up eating till 8 00pm and only got drinks and two appetizers to share . Their sweet potato fries is sweet potato not fries with habenero oil all over and the aioli is supposed to help with the heat. But way too hot  It s overpowering or maybe ours just was and I like heat . Then their shrimp tostado was raw like wasn t expecting that. I have never had raw shrimp and it was too slimy. What I will say is server was a nice man and saw we were both in shock with sweet potato so he took that off our bill. Oh and my martini was in the smallest martini glass I have ever had a martini in. Hah  Inside was nice atmosphere
Suerte,241,Given how snazzy it is  this place is very reasonably priced. Service was great and prepared a menu in advance for one of us with dietary restrictions - they had marked down everything he could have and where they could make adjustments to existing items to fit his needs.  Go ahead and get multiple orders of the suadero tacos - they were the standout dish. The black magic oil  which tastes similar to laoganma  is a really unique combination with tacos and something I had never had before - but definitely will have again    Compared to the carne asada  the tacos are the real winner here.
Suerte,242,Super cool  hip joint that serves some impressive food  tamal .  We ordered that tamal and tacos de lengua and our bellies thanked us. The Masa is made fresh and I swear  perfect-enough salt and chile that the cooked dough is so flavorful that you can eat it be itself  sans filling even. The tacos were presented two ways fried and not fried. The lengua was exquisite and so rich.  The only drawback  of you don t mind the prices  is the parking  which can be a challenge.  Want to go back 
Suerte,243,Omg      So delicious    Must try  Everything is so flavorful  Sudadero tacos  al pastor quesadilla  their desserts are amazing  
Suerte,244,Super high price point for  trendy  food that was not even just ok. Guess it may have been better at one point to get the place on TV. Pros   Nice restaurant Excellent plating on food items Good drinks Cons  Salty food 16 dollar mini tacos More salty food Food that doesn t taste as good as it looks  Recommend a pass and maybe hit up a taco truck in the area.
Suerte,245,This is probably the best service I have ever received in any restaurant anywhere. All staff was super attentive to our table  but our main staff member was super knowledgeable telling us all about what went into every dish. The food was incredible. The guacamole was a little different  but delicious. The beef tacos where excellent  out of this world  and so were the chicken thighs and goat. We also tried some different desserts and they were really great as well. The staff s knowledge on mezcal was also super fun. We are from Minnesota and it was really an experiencing learning about mezcal and trying different drinks and types of it  Would highly  highly recommend making a reservation and making this place a stop as part of any Austin trip 
Suerte,246,I think this place is very overrated. The location is great and the restaurant is decorated perfectly but that s where it all stops for me. It s upscale Latin Mexican food which is already hard for me to get behind because the best Latin foods come from food trucks but I was very unsatisfied leaving dinner. The hamachi crudo was the best item I had on the menu. The Suadero tacos were small  not filling  and boring. For the price  the quantity and taste weren t there. This place is always packed though so maybe it was an off day...
Suerte,247,Mexican from LA here so I know what s up. Portions are extremely small and very expensive and everything was below average in my opinion aside from their tacos de asada. We were 5 people and somehow racked up a 215 dollar bill for some literal street food. Pretty much only white people in the restaurant which makes sense because they re the only ones who have no clue lol. Don t believe me  then go drop a rack and feel like an idiot. Disgrace to my culture tbh.
Suerte,248,Probably my favorite restaurant in Austin. Knocks it out of the park every single time. Love the chilaquiles on the brunch menu. Some of my other favorites are the happy hour tacos and the brisket tacos. Lentils with chips are surprisingly great. Always end it with the tres leches carrot cake -- a dream. Only critique would be the cocktails. Margarita is a little bland  and I love mezcal palomas but I m not a huge fan of their grapefruit soda. Love this place  would highly recommend.
Suerte,249,Absolutely adore Suerte  Everything on the menu is spectacular and the cocktails are the bomb. The suadero tacos might just be the best thing you ve ever tasted. Plus the service is always perfect. I live in California but make a point of going here every time I visit Austin.
Suerte,250,Suerte is one of the best culinary experiences I ve had in my life. I spent 25 years of my life in Mexico  ate at hundreds of taquerias  and Suerte s Suadero Brisket Tacos are on the top 5 tacos I ve had. Love the place. I m confident you will love it too.  By the way  I never write reviews on Yelp but this place deserves all the recognition.
Suerte,251,The drinks are phenomenal. Don Dario was excellent. The bean dip we ordered was pretty meh for the  17 price  really heavy on the cheese. Ordered the tacos and the chicken  the inhouse made corn tortillas are pretty good but I ve had tastier and cheaper tortillas made by Mexican Grandmothers my entire life.  Something that bothered both of us  there were no greens to speak of. The chicken came with a pureed bean thing with some creme and maybe 3 thinly sliced radishes. The tacos were a hunk of overly soft meat with a disgusting guac that tasted more like creme and again no cilantro tomatos anything that requires the use of molars. In general the food was weirdly soft and heavy - with the exception of the tortillas the restaurant leaned more on American barbeque than Mexican cuisine.  I m from SoCal this was tragic and absolutely not worth the price except for the pretty good Margarita. The waiter was also a pompous prick.
Suerte,252,I mean it definitely lives up to the hype. Thar sa dero taco is pretty damn epic  No wonder it s all over TV. That beef is just too damn divine. And on top of it the avocado crudo is just heavenly.   The star though is a the Masa flour for their tortillas.  Even the crispy chips in the beginning are so damn good because it s literally house made as if some magical abuelita was behind the scenes pouring her magic potion over the recipes.   The tortillas alone are just SO GOOD. Next time I m combining the filling from two tacos into one and eating the one  tortilla solo.  So much to do. So little time.   Anyway we also  tried the flan which was delicious  The drinks are spectacular and overal the vibe of this spot is Austin at its best mixed with high end cooking techniques.    Must try.
Suerte,253,I finally found what I ve been missing in my quest for unique and more authentic Mexican cuisine experience.. I m sad they don t have one of these in Dallas where I live. The vibe  the service  the food all are exactly what I appreciate. The drinks were on another level. My cocktail with red rhubarb in it was one of the most delicious things I ve ever drank. At the end I wanted a smooth shot of tequila  my server suggested G4. Wow. And he heard it was my birthday so he made it extra special with some lovely Masa ice cream and a candle  A must try place when in Austin.
Suerte,254,Pretentious and overpriced. We had Wagyu brisket tacos and goat barbacoa.  The restaurant  had over an hour wait so we were seated in a tent in the parking lot.  To be fair we saw this and were hungry so we agreed to it but with the flies and heat it was barley a one star environment.  The food trucks nearby would have been a much better choice.  The drinks were good but at 16  per little glass  I mean come on.  They do not even serve beer. The Brisket tacos were pretty good but at 5 per little tiny taco it was a little much.  By the way if you know how to cook brisket prime is just as good as Wagyu  so really just an added waste for the restaurant.  The goat was ok  but very expensive  there was not much and I would not call this barbacoa.  It was wrapped in a banana leaf which made for a nice presentation  but the leaves were hotter than the meat.  There is a certain Smokey  earthy flavor that you expect from Barbados and this had none of that.  Should called have called this stewedgoat  reheated with steam.  The goat was an eye popping 40 .  We will not be returning customers.
Suerte,255,Came here for a New Year s tasting menu. They only accept reservations for New Years. The interior is very nice  no dress code but definitely don t come in looking like a bum. They served everyone at the same time.   The food was very unique  consisted of things that you normally won t be able to find normally. Overall  the food was yummy  the wagyu was a little disappointing  but everything else was solid . It was a great way to ring in the new year. They even had New Years hats and beads for people to take 
Suerte,256,I was most excited to try out this place on our first visit to Austin  but it fell short on expectations. Ambiance  amp  service - 4 5 Our server was very sweet. Food - 2 5 we got the aguachile shrimp  roasted beets  fish a la talla  grilled pompano   and the suadero tacos. The shrimp had a slightly slimy texture to it which we were not used to  definitely not ceviche like  but had a tasty dressing. Roasted beets meh. The fish was cooked well except the middle was underdone and chewy. The tacos were very good  quite decadent but served to us at the very last so felt a bit heavy. The masa tortillas were amazing - soft and fresh off the stove   Cocktails - 3 5 nothing wow to write about I ll try my luck elsewhere in ATX   
Suerte,257,Amazing food  bad service.  Everything we ordered from drinks to food was delicious. My favorites were the chips  amp  dip  don t know what it was called  it s no longer on their online menu. Something with almonds  dark brown red in color  with pico on top  and the suadero tacos. Tacos were amazing and a must try. Boyfriends fav was the hamachi crudo. We also got the goat barbacoa and quesadilla  which were yummy as well but less stand out.   After we arrived and got seated the waitress said she d be right back to take our order. We waited 15 minutes before she returned. I kept looking around for her and she was nowhere to be found. When she finally returned  she immediately went to the table right next to us  who were seated a good 5-6 minutes after us and took their order first. As such  their food and drinks came out well before ours  so even more waiting around for us and I was haaangryy. They ordered the same appetizers as us so it wasn t that our food took longer  she simply put in our order after theirs. Not cool  lady.
Suerte,258,I would this place serves modern and eclectic cuisine with a Mexican flare. Pork quesadilla  beef street tacos and guacamole all worked amazing well. The menu is definitely different but the food was delish. All the salsa had a different taste but worked somehow and hands down best homemade corn tortillas I ve ever had. Mole plate was pricey and not as authentic Mexican as I like it to be and fish tacos definitely lit a fire in your mouth  Spivey but good taste  but overall all I kept thinking was when I d be visiting this place once again 
Suerte,259,Holy moly. INCREDIBLE    Literally everything was amazing  the ambiance  the food  decor  cocktails down to the best tres leches cake I ve ever had the pleasure of having. Chris was our server and educated us about Mezcal Monday which prompted us to try the WaWaMelon for the first time  it s just as delicious as everything else we ordered. Will be back 
Suerte,260,Amazing service  amazing food  a must do when in Austin  We ordered the barbacoa goat tacos  quesadilla  my fav   hamachi  tamale  and for dessert the chocotaco. All were phenomenal  Can t wait to come back and visit. 5 stars  
Suerte,261,We got kicked out for parking in their to-go parking. Literally. The other parking stories are 100  true.  About  40 into our dinner  before ordering entrees  and the guy in charge says I have to move because I m affecting their takeout business.  I wasn t able to park on the street and couldn t fit into their non-takeout spots because of the size of my truck. They d rather have 5 empty takeout spots than a dine-in customer park in a takeout spot.  I mean  they can do whatever they want - it s just that alienating your paying customers in exchange for maintaining empty spots is an interesting business model.  Edit to respond to reply  Hostesses knew we parked there  as we told them when being seated just in case it was an issue. Was pretty much getting kicked out since there wasn t really an option to stay... lol
Suerte,262,Apparently this is going to be a hot take but I truly don t know how this place has 4.5 stars.   Firstly-- we ordered the guac and drinks to start. To be clear  if you re charging me  14 for guac  it better be the best guac I ve ever had. It was certainly not. No tomatoes  cilantro  onions or anything to be seen in this. It looks like it was scooped from the HEB container to the bowl. And also-- who in the world charges for extra chips  What kind of place is this    Additionally as an app we got the Mackerel Crudo which was very good  but very expensive for what it was.   For dinner we split the masa gnocchi which I would recommend-- very good. Two sets of tacos -- Fish tacos  amp  suadero. These were both good  but also hard to mess up tacos. So again  for the price  I wasn t blown away. Additionally we split the pollo a la lena which the waiter highly recommended. However  I just wasn t blown away but maybe I m just not a mole negro person and it was a bit lost on me. We got the cauliflower to round out dinner which was very good  but what cauliflower isn t    Finally we got the tres leche cake which was good. I really appreciated the flavors in this dish-- I would give it a 6.5 10. Good but not great.   Overall  i d say if you re looking to overpay  for cute ambiance  and  average food-- this is your spot 
Suerte,263,Out of all the restaurants I have tried  I have never experienced this much professionalism and care. I decided to give this restaurant another shot and it was probably the best decision I have made.  The aguachile was delicious and fresh. The Suadero tacos were tender and not tough as the first time I have tried them. I will order them every time I come here. Lastly  the best part was the Carne Asada. Although the wait was a bit longer for the main  it was definitely worth the wait  The meat was full of flavor and I love the fried mushrooms. Overall  it was a great experience and the staff  especially Jillian  were kind and made the experience even better. I can t wait to come back and try out different items on their menu.
Suerte,264,I stopped in for a quick try of this masterpiece.  The tamal was amazing.  It is a vegetarian meal bursting with flavor.  The atmosphere is deluxe and crowd is sophisticated.  Check them out 
Suerte,265,Absolute goto place in Austin. I could sit here and have a michilada with street tacos any day. Tostada is killer. The elotes is a must have.  The menu is always changing so if you don t see these specific items  trust me...you can t go wrong. You could also go for happy hour and order a little of everything 
Suerte,266,Went here for the second time on Feb. 8  and it was just as mind-blowingly delicious as the first time. Favorite dish this time was the ceviche  It was the perfect balance of flavors and textures.  I was a little disappointed by the chorizo beans we had to start... I definitely expected more flavor  and it reminded me of a bland chile con carne. The pork belly was phenomenal  and a big dish. Honestly  you can t go wrong with almost anything on the menu and it s so hard to choose  FOMO  . We did splurge for desert and got the lemon cake with preserves and guava cream cheese. The  only  thing that could have made it better was some sort of not-crazy-sweet ice cream. The cocktails we got were decent  but in retrospect I don t think they were necessary. Our tummies were plenty happy with the food itself  and I m always amazed by the creativity and care taken to design each dish. The ingredients speak for themselves in everything we ve ordered.
Suerte,267,The food was good but the service was the worst I have ever had.  Our server was extremely unhelpful and rude.  It was very windy which is out their control  so we inquired if we could move inside.  The manager was somewhat helpful but moving was not an option.  This is not the reason for the poor rating.  While he was speaking to us one of the support staff delivered our drinks. He literally dropped the drink on the table and it spilled all over me.  He profusely apologized and I told him that accidents happened.  We said a shot for the 4 us would be appreciated. He said he would get it for us.  When we got the check he charged us for a very expensive Tequila.  The dinner was  500 for 4 people.  Enough said  stay away from this place.
Suerte,268,Tried several dishes from weekend brunch menu. They were all delicious  First time tried smoked lengua which was absolutely yummy   Would like to go back and try more from dinner menu 
Suerte,269,Sorry suerte but yelp is my free place where I can be real to people about how restaurants actually are. I ve always found suerte so amusing because they serve food at small portion sizes that aren t much better than what you get at taquerias in Mexico or on the border but charge     for less. So what made suerte so hyped  SOCIAL MEDIA. They invited a bunch of trendy bloggers and people who convinced every one it was the best new restaurant ever. Ask any blogger real talk and they ll tell you they thought suerte was just OKAY. on to the food. We got the suadera tacos  17 dollars  the ceviche  16  and the carne asada  50 dollars  note that it looks like they modified the carne asada  the one I had came with beans. We also had this elote in a cup thing that was 9 dollars that is no longer on the menu.   The food  my favorite was the suadero tacos  they re delicious but not the best tacos I ve ever had  I prefer discada. The tacos here were probably the size of my palm. Really small street tacos and you get 4 for 17. Everything else wasn t really worth it. The carne asada looked like sliced steak on a pile of black beans which isn t really attractive. And made my stomach hurt.   The service  we were taking photos of the food and the server told us to stop. Which was kind of embarrassing. I guess unless you re a approved bloggers no photos  For the rest of the night service just felt awkward and we felt like pests.   Ambience  it s really dark and you can t see anything but hey that s hip nowadays.  Overall  overhyped  overpriced  and not worth checking out IMO. people just check it out because it s super hyped. For good carne asada check out the local taquerias. Best tacos I ve ever had was discada and rositas al pastor. Also check out velvet taco for your elote fix.
Suerte,270,Food was great  but customer service was very disappointing. Previously attended a work event here so I was looking forward to similar service.
Suerte,271,Awesome dinner waiter Johnathan was exceptional.  Food and drinks above par and so delicious.  Only hiccup was hostess who was lackluster and was like you missed your reservation by 2 minutes and we had to cancel but we still got a table no need to school us.
Suerte,272,Been here a several times.  - Drinks  DON DARIO can be great  but have noticed that it doesn t taste the same during happy hour. Idk if they make a large batch of the pre-mixed drink for happy hours  but when I have paid the full price after happy hour I have noticed that it has been shaken and you get a layer of foam on top with well balanced flavors. But during happy hour it lacks these things and tastes like mixer bottle and tequila on ice. - Food  I always get a side of the SUADERO Tacos. When they are fresh  and the corn tortillas is warm hot it is much more aromatic and flavorful. The last time we went  they were cold  and its not the same. I have really loved the SOPES in the past  but they stopped making them. I recently tried the PORK BELLY EN OTONO which was actually pretty unique and flavorful. I think because its a newer dish  they put more TLC into it.  Usually I order 4-5 food items. Usually I really enjoy 1-2  think another 1-2 are unique but ok  and 1-2 that I wouldn t order again.
Suerte,273,Took a while to get seating on a busy weekend night  but it was all worth it  Great food and great service. I walked away to use the restroom  came back to my napkin nicely folded. Attention to detail is amazing.
Suerte,274,Top class Mexican food. A little different than your regular Mexican joints. This place is unique  I  can t recommend the brisket tacos enough. You have to try them. The starters and specials that we got were great and the drinks just as tasty.  Social distancing is adhered too and it s very clean. Definitely recommend.
Suerte,275,I very much enjoying my dining experience at Suerte. The food was truly top-notch. Tastes and flavors and textures were all exquisite. The service was really great. The guy who took care of us was kind and easy going - really made the experience special for me and my wife.   We had their salad  one of the best salads I ve ever eaten - the dressing and textures were perfect   the barbacoa tacos  an ejote tostada  a blueberry paleta  and the chaco taco. I can only say good things about every dish. They were different in all the right ways  while still grounded in good-ole-cooking. The meats were perfectly cooked  tortillas - literally - magical  didn t fall apart like most tortillas  kinda thick but in a good way   desserts superb  the paleta was sweetened perfectly with fruit  and the chaco taco was a mad mix of caramel and mouse    and nuts and ice cream . Great meal all around.   I also love the ambiance. Everything s classy and beautiful. I came here before COVID and it was buzzing with energy. It s still energetic and fun  but of course with appropriate spacing and distancing. I can t wait to come back when things settle down and enjoy the jam-packed buzz again   
Suerte,276,not your typical mexican food... elevated  amp  modern cuisine and it still tastes authentic
Suerte,277,9 10 - We were walking around  East 6th  as a local taught me  and we found Suerte. Kind of unnoticeably hidden compared to everywhere else and it was a great find. Amazing service  and our chips and guacamole cremosa.....
Suerte,278,So much to say    My friend and I just had a lovely sit down dinner inside for the first time ever for us both at Suerte  We have heard from everyone about their tacos and chocolate taco   We ordered all 3 for happy hour  2 tacos of your choice for  5     They have squash  chicken and pork .. the famous brisket ones are not on the HH menu. We ordered 4 beef anyway- WORTH IT. Brisket mini street tacos are so flavorful  what is the marinade they use... I don t know but it s magic  and super tender and smothered in guac and topped with raw white onion on a corn tortilla . All their tacos are tiny    2-3 bites each so order accordingly  The street corn with Gouda cheese foam   It s perfect serving for 2 people. We each had a cocktail  I had the El Burro with shishito infused vodka  ginger and lime  . Their lentils dip and giant blue masa chips  their version of chips and dip   is addictive. Then we finished with the chocotaco  Caramel Cinnamon mousse sooo fun and tasty  Not just for looks. Can definitely share one as it s not tiny like the other street tacos .  I will be back to try all the things   Such a REFRESHING inventive take on fresh Mexican cuisine. A true East austin gem . Thank you Yoshi from Otoko for recommending    
Suerte,279,Update time  My wife and I ordered the brisket taco meal   Don Dario with tequila  lemon cheesecake cookies  and a hat  The meal is fantastic and comes with super simple instructions. It s accessible regardless of your experience level in the kitchen. The meal includes a kale salad  charro beans  fideo seco  brisket  black magic oil  and plenty of killer tortillas. I just figured out what is in the black magic oil  and Chef is a damn genius. This meal was just what I needed. If it s available next week  I m ordering again. The cookies are later  and I can t wait. Thank you  Suerte.
Suerte,280,Looking for amazing tacos  tostada chips and salsa that is socially distanced  You ve found your place  Decided to try this spot after reading a Texas Monthly article and seeing it featured on Taco Chronicles streaming on Netflix. Let me tell  it did not disappoint  the only disappointing part was eating too many of my Suadero tacos and not saving room for dessert  The tostada chips and salsa trio was amazing  the green sauce was my favorite. The Suadero tacos were tender  perfectly spicy  and just the right size.
Suerte,281,Amazing atmosphere  strong drinks and pretty wallpaper. Unfortunately that s about all this place has to offer. Bland overpriced tapas belong in Silverlake  I d take your money elsewhere and enjoy Mexican food at the hundreds of other authentic Austin spots. Buena suerte with this restaurant.  They did comp our burnt chicken so that was a plus 
Suerte,282,This place is great the vibe is super casual yet comfy seating  drinks and food are great they have some variety like never seen
Suerte,283,We sat out on the patio  and our server was attentive and knowledgeable  specifically about gluten free items. The food was outstanding. The Suadero Tacos were the clear favorite  Cocktails and beer were great with the Nada Paloma loved by all.  First dining experience in Austin and would highly recommend.
Suerte,284,I REALLY wanted to love this place  but the food just fell short. We walked in and the place is really cool looking  super friendly staff greeting you on arrival who seated us off to the side on a high top while we waited for our table. We ordered a cocktail from the happy hour menu and it was delicious.   Once seated our waitress arrived and was very friendly and fun  We ordered the quesadilla and tacos. Based on the experience so far we thought we were in for a real treat and excited  Unfortunately the food just didn t live up to the hype and quite honestly  just wasn t very good. Quesadilla was bland and the tacos were mediocre at best - pale in comparison to most food trucks in Austin.   Despite this - we may go back to try something else  based on the atmosphere  staff and cocktails. But if you need great Mexican food and are in town for a trip - there s a bunch of better options IMO.
Suerte,285,Great dinner  Friendly service from hostess to waiter everyone we encountered even valet attendant was lovely. We met another couple for dinner and ended up staying at restaurant for almost three hours and never once felt rushed to get out of restaurant.  Food was amazing ordered several different dishes for the table to share and all were enjoyed. Favorites were the corn dish  peaches and mango dish  tacos  and tres leche. Highly recommend 
Suerte,286,Here s what not to do at Suerte  make a meal of ordering everything on the  masa and mas  menu as my party did the other night. A bunch of offbeat ingredients  eg sunchokes  which are novel but not particularly distinctive in taste  in small bites with the unifying principle being that tostadas or tortillas are present in some form. Other than the Suadero Tacos  brisket tacos  there s not a thing I would order again.  There is a Michelin-starred restaurant in Orange County  CA called Taco Maria I guess I thought this might emulate. There  the tacos are dipped in crema then griddled or rolled in flavored oil. They become a fascinating foundation for a novel eating experience instead of an afterthought as they are here that doesn t really contribute anything.  I would not put up a review like this  negative and based on one visit and a small portion of the menu  if there were not so many other positive reviews. But if you ve been wondering if there are some weak spots in the menu  here s one person s opinion.
Suerte,287,This is not your cheap street food Mexican food. If you re looking for no-fuss  quality  straight to the point tacos  come to Suerte  The salsa sampler  add guac  is the perfect start to the meal. The chips are large fried corn tortillas allowing you to break off your own pieces. All the salsas were unique and highly flavorful  We ordered the Calabazas tacos and the Pollo. Both extremely flavorful and filling  10 10 recommend. BOMB 
Suerte,288,Amazing   We came here for my birthday dinner. no free dessert though. guess that only comes with  250 meals downtown. lol.   We had the best meal but my only complaint was with the goat meat plate  it literally had a tablespoon of beans. really  come on for  20-30 bucks you could at least have put a cup of beans on there.   But the flavors in everthing we had were phenomenal. esp. the blondie dessert. butternut squash ice cream. what  delish  It was jam packed on a Tuesday night... felt like Saturday at 8 pm up in there. gentrification has hit and it is here to stay. ill miss the parking here to go to Whisler s but it was a great place to dine  i ll admit.
Suerte,289,Really enjoyed the ambience and food here. We got an assortment of things and they all were delicious. I would recommend the tuna tostada and brisket tacos. The tortillas are made fresh to order. You can t beat that 
Suerte,290,Recommendation from a friend who saw Suerte in a popular Instagram post. Amazing food and service  The tostadas and salsas appetizer was really good  Be sure to get a cocktail. Expensive.
Suerte,291,Past dinner experiences have averaged 4 stars. Brunch however is a definite two stars so need to drop this down to 3 stars overall.  If I could describe the brunch experience in one word it would be  flavorless. Everything was so bland and I haven t been back since  it was many months ago . And the price for the portion  quality and lack of flavor felt like a poor value too.  I hate how often I come across restaurants in Austin who start off really well  but can t maintain a level of consistency or in this case  flavor. I hope that is not the case here  but I m uncertain if I will be back to find out. I m not opposed to it  the brunch experience just left a poor taste or lack there of.
Suerte,292,Wow  wow  wow   Just an amazing experience   food  service   atmosphere   Decided to head to Austin before the kids go back to school beginning with dinner at Suerte which was simply amazing   We began with a couple of appetizers - the roasted papas y quesillo papas and burrata with beans - both absolutely delicious    Then we had three raw fish dishes  Aguachili  tostada mixta and ceviche Suerte which were all delicious  Followed by the mushroom tlacoyo and a corn dish  All out of this world.  The food was as delicious  novel and perfect portions  all with perfect service is in a really cool location. Would return again in a heartbeat 
Suerte,293,The dishes are creative and generally I enjoyed everything I tried  although nothing blew me away.  The chips salsa gouda appetizer was set on top of giant chips which made it difficult to break apart for sharing.  The chips were spicy and the toppings were tasty.  The Suadero confit brisket tacos were good  although some of the brisket pieces were very fatty and inedible.  The tortillas were tasty and the avocado salsa nice  but it felt like something was missing.  The carne asada main course was pricey  considering a large portion of the dish was beans  but the meat was good quality.    I ll be back to give it another try and order different things.
Suerte,294,Loved the veggie selections  eggplant  tempura green beans  fried lentils. Guacamole was very tasty.
Suerte,295,My mom and I came here for dinner when we were walking around sixth street. We didn t have a reservation but the place was very cute so we decided to go in. Lucky for us they were able to seat us right away. Once we sat we began to look at the menu. There was many options and they all seemed enticing. We started with the aguachile. This was probably my favorite thing we got. It was just spicy enough and the shrimp was not at all fishy tasting. Next we got the masa gnocchi. I was very interested by this dish but it wasn t all that i expected. It was very salty  possibly because of the cheese on top but it was overwhelming. The flavor of the gnocchi itself was good but the texture was a bit too mushy for me. After our gnocchi came out it took quite a while for our final dish to come. Our waiter was nice but not too attentive to us. Finally our swordfish came out and it was pretty disappointing. This  again  was overly salty and the other flavors were overpowered by that aspect of the dish. The nuts on top of the fish also tasted burnt. The texture of the fish itself was nice but I wasn t a huge fan of the dish overall. However  it came with tortillas that were so good and very fresh. After that dish we decided against dessert and left. This restaurant looked interesting and the dishes had a lot of potential but in reality I didn t enjoy my experience here that much.
Suerte,296,Absolutely amazing food  service and atmosphere. Our server Quentin was attentive  knowledgeable and extremely welcoming. He made our experience perfect 
Suerte,297,This is a really good restaurant that gets quite a lot of it right.  A few highlights  1. Complimentary valet parking 2. Outstanding service from end-to-end  calling in with questions  staging the courses based on what you order  on-going attentiveness during the meal  3. Happy Hour Cocktails  Don Dario    6 is too good to pass up  4. Some all-star dishes  the Goat Barbacoa is a MUST  Reason for 4 stars is consistency on the food. Given how outstanding some of the dishes are  Nachos  Suerde Tacos  and relatively light selection on the menu  you d expect everything to equally as good as the service.  For one  the el taquito taco on happy hour is a rotation  but our pork loin tacos  small tacos  roughly 2 medium sized bites  had several bits of tough cartilage that made it difficult to eat. I have no issues with cartilage or bones as long as they re part of the dish  i.e. whole fish  bone-in steaks  etc.   but for bite-sized tacos  the expectation shouldn t be having to pick out tough chunks from your teeth. Another overwhelming disappointing dish was the Duck Breast y Mole Negro especially compared next to another entre  the goat barbacoa we had.  Suerte is definitely a restaurant worth checking out in Austin  but the inconsistency in calibre of dishes is wildly noticeable given the otherwise 5-star performance.
Suerte,298,The food is fantastic and the atmosphere is also great. The drinks were wonderful too. We had ceviche  guacamole  brisket tacos  fish tacos and it was all delicious. It is an expensive restaurant  but it made for a really fun night with friends. Great for work dinners and girls night out.
Suerte,299,Best d mn tacos I ve ever had in my life. Delicious cocktails. Hand-blown glassware. Staff that is super friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. I came to Austin on a work trip and was only there for a week  but hit up Suerte 3 times because it was THAT good.

Suerte,301,Let s get right to it   Grapefruit curd donut - donut was fine but curd was nonexistent  barely tasted like grapefruit.  El Governator  snapper  tacos  quesillos  folded over and fried  - oily and burnt and the fish flavor was completely lost. And the sauce on the side was super bitter.  Lengua tacos - tiny but loaded with meat  pretty good. Fresh and tasty corn tortillas.  Duck flautas with mole - filling was delicious and the sauce was beautifully smoky  loved these.  Pork shoulder tamale and roasted tomato onion garlic sauce - the meat was lost in the tamale  but the sauce was a knockout and I m thinking I need to try making it on my own.  Pork y huevo - pork and sauce both were very much like what I put in my guisada at home  fall apart shoulder and a chile-based sauce  very nicely done. But the sweet potato chips and pickled onions - especially the pickled onions - were out of place and not necessary.  The service was super attentive and knowledgeable. Also loved the interior space. But it s too  try hard  and while I appreciate creativity  there were too many poorly executed ideas. And  as is a common complaint with me  too expensive for small portions of those poorly executed ideas.  So  all in all  not terrible  not great. Another place I won t seek out again when I return to Austin.
Suerte,302,We Loved every bite of every thing we tried. We went for brunch on Saturday. They d only been open an hour and were already sold out of one of the specials.  Then  we had the classic suerte tacos. So spicy and so good  The place was hoppin  at noon. A 20 minute wait for a table so we just ate at the bar.  This place is well worth a visit
Suerte,303,Came for the NYE 7 course tasting menu with drink pairings and it was amazing. The service was impeccable  at one point my boyfriend used his napkin to wipe up a little bit of water on the table and seconds later someone brought him a new napkin  every member of the staff helped our table at one point. The food was amazing  for a 7 course menu the portions were massive though  I kept trying to not finish plates so I could make it through all the courses  they easily could have been half the size but it was super generous and the food was outstanding so it was hard to stop. It was an expensive meal but totally worth it  we re already wanting to go back.
Suerte,304,Food was over priced and flavorless. The flounder civeche was gross  the best thing was the guac. No one checked on us  even after we noticeably had not eaten the fish -- no ask on how everything tasted and poor service  amp  angry server. Over hyped
Suerte,305,This is the type of place that says  we don t have salsa  we have tomato pur e.  Food is pretty good though.
Suerte,306,Unbelievable. I had a reservation and still had to wait over an hour. The hostess said we would be seated  next . Well low and behold 5 parties seated later. I cleared my bar bill and left. Unacceptable.
Suerte,307,We came here while visiting Austin for a conference and am so happy we came. They are known for their masa which is made in house and is like a sturdier version of a tortilla chip. We started off with the guacamole  a lentil  dip  ceviche and then transitioned to their beef tacos  roasted eggplant  fluke  steak and my favorite the tamal with white mole. For dessert we tried one of everything and by fair my favorite was the charred meringue with Texas peach on the inside followed by the Chaco taco. Not to mention their drinks were fantastic  The mezcal was perfect with the meal. Definitely would recommend if you re looking for an authentic Mexican Austin experience.
Suerte,308,Flew in on a short business trip over the weekend and decided to come here to meet my sister and her new husband.  I ve never been to Austin so I questioned anyone s food knowledge based on the fact if they pronounced it-- Queso or KAY-SO.   I was skeptical.  Luckily  this was did not disappoint.  I will say that the portion sizes were a tad bit small for the price. Example  the chilaquiles were maybe a handful of chips  Idk.   This place was really good that I visited twice. Prob spent like  500 in one day
Suerte,309,My love took me during off menu week in Austin and I didn t realize we could still order from on the menu. We ordered so. Much. Food. Y all.   The ambience was quiet loud but I guess that s just what it is. It was packed on Thursday at 8 30.   Unfortunately some of the plates we ordered were delivered to the table next to even though they had just sat down so the timing of our dishes was disappointing but the waitress apologized once she realized and comped those plates.   The highlights for me were the things pictured- tiny little tacos  the ceviche  and my carne asada... like it was so amazing. Would definitely come back just for it.
Suerte,310,Fantastic atmosphere at Suerte and amazing food. The chefs here cook up great tasting Oaxacan inspired cuisine. I wouldn t have known about this spot if it wasn t for a bartender at a different restaurant. Upon entering  you ll see a very dimly lit restaurant but it s bustling with chatter. It really is a great spot to just hang out and talk over Mexican food.   On my last night in Austin  I decided to come here and give it a shot. Since I visited alone  I was able to find seating by the chef s counter very easily. What I ve noticed during my 5 day stay here is that alot of restaurants in Austin have an open kitchen and I love having that experience to sit close to the kitchen and watch the chefs do their magic. It gives you  the customer a real experience how the kitchen works in synergy and how your dish is prepared and inspected before landing in front of you.   Since I wasn t too hungry  I only tried two of their dishes  quesadilla tetemada and suadero tacos. Both were spectacular with Mexican herbs  spices and flavor. What I did notice was that the dishes were a bit on the salty side but I wasn t sure if it s just me or a Texas thing. All the food I ve had during my stay was always on the saltier side. To pair the dishes  I ordered their horchata  which is mixed with sweet potato. It gives it more of a creamier taste and the color of the horchata looks more like milk tea. If you re ever in town  definitely visit Suerte and try out the rest of their menu. I wish I could ve tried more but those two dishes filled me up.
Suerte,311,DAMN   THE HYPE IS LEGITIMATE    As the year winds down it seems pretty unlikely that another meal will knock my dinner at this new-ATX classic from its title as  Best meal of 2019 .  Everything I sampled was delicious but the star of the show for me without a doubt were the much lauded  Suadero  brisket tacos  which may damn well have been nothing short of the best tacos I have ever had anywhere  period.  I would have thought it would have been damn near impossible for a brisket to blow my mind in this town at this point  having visited here often for the greater part of a decade now  but wow these bad boys managed to.  The description of  brisket confit  was deliciously accurate  as whatever ingenious cooking technique they deploy here result in the both the consistency and flavor we ve come to love so in brisket being amplified by at least a good couple of 1000 percent.  It s also absorbed in an equally deliciously-apt named  black magic oil .  Again I have no idea what that actually is or the technique involved in its preparation  but it results in not only added deliciousness but also imbues the brisket with a striking and beautiful black color as dark as night.          Those tacos are topping freshly made tortillas fashioned with the house made masa  the restaurants signature calling card and point of pride.  They re delicious as are the many other forms you are likely to encounter the masa in here  which for us included delicious masa dumplings served along side a rich dark mole sauce accompanying perfectly prepared and gorgeous medium rare duck breast  as well as a basket of some additional light as air fresh tortillas served on the side for good measure  because hey you really should get as much of this places masa in your stomach if you have a chance to.  While masa is king here everything tasted with or without it was uniformly excellent  including a zesty and and spicy yet effervescent shrimp ceviche tostada to start of the meal  and a decadently rich and delicious mind blower of a dessert with the monicker of Chocoloco   Stone ground chocolate mousse with candy sesame seed...wowow.         These were all washed down with deliciously smokey mezcal drinks that complemented the food  and its updated and highly designed chic setting wonderfully   as did the service by a lovely guy who struck the perfect yet rarely achieved balance of cool  engaged and extremely helpful yet without one iota of pretension or condescension in the equation.  It seems pretty difficult to secure a table or seat here but I suggest you make every attempt to  get one if you re in ATX because it really is that damn amazing.
Suerte,312,Just to let y all know the water boil issue hasn t affected the restaurant and the food. As detailed by the server upon us asking  apparently they have been boiling all there water within the massive containers they use to prepare the masa for dinner service.  As per usual I take in the atmosphere and the architecture of the space that I m in and this place is beautiful. The usual door picture is in order just because...so go get that Instagram worthy door pic   As for food I think we ordered almost everything  well one of everything. The octopus tostada  aguachile  suadero tacos  chicken roulade  fish a la devil  and the roasted acorn squash. Everything was delicious  My favorite though was the chicken roulade and the roasted acorn squash  we topped off the night chocolate puddin cake and the persimmon ice cream. The persimmon ice cream doesn t taste like persimmon. Just an fyi  another great girls night in the books 
Suerte,313,The drinks were delicious the food was superb. I will say I wish they had more options because the food was so good 
Suerte,314,Aye yo. Best dam Mexican food in the city. Expensive but open your wallet and your heart to this culinary experience. Worth every penny and the servers are extremely knowledgeable and Erica was awesome.
Suerte,315,Not impressed with this place. Wait staff was rude and no one picks up the phone. The waiter up upsold us into ordering way too much food which was overpriced and fine.
Suerte,316,I was hosting a group of colleagues from China  and wanted to pick someplace that would impress them with Austin cuisine.  Suerte did the trick     The ordering model of Suerte is ideal for a group  in that Suerte encourages you to order several plates to share with the table.  This is great for getting to sample a lot of different dishes.  Our table really enjoyed this approach. The only slight drawback was that share plates were not automatically provided or refreshed.  We had to ask for them throughout the meal.  While our group was comfortable sharing  they were definitely not comfortable eating off of the same plates.  The food was spectacular as it has been on my previous visits.  Service was very friendly and efficient.  And the noise level  while not quiet  was much better than my earliest visits.  Suerte has invested in sound absorbing materials  and it is working.  During and after the dinner my colleagues continued to comment about how wonderful  fresh and healthy the food was.  They had no idea that Mexican food could be this diverse. Mission accomplished in that I recommended a great spot to my colleagues proving a meal to remember in all the best ways.
Suerte,317,Whenever a spot blows up and wins tons of awards  there s always the question - is this place going to live up to the hype  Suerte definitely delivers.  I ordered a few dishes for take out and was worried how the tacos would stand up to the drive home  but Suerte packages everything separately so you can assemble fresh at home. A call out to the corn tortillas - tender and delicious. I used to be a flour tortilla type of gal  but so many places  nod to Cuantros as well  are delivering amazing tortillas  it s easy to make the switch   Suadero Tacos  The star of the restaurant and for good reason. Succulent and tender brisket  with the sharp citrus creamy combo of guacamole  what s not to love  I could eat just this dish and be happy.   Barbacoa Tacos  Another hit  with the rich meat  cut with a slightly smoky salsa roja.   Campechano Quesadilla  A mix of carnitas and chorizo sealed in corn tortilla with gouda cheese paired with an amazing tomatillo salsa  this may have beat out the barbacoa tacos as my second favorite.    One note- I saw a bunch of reviews mentioning portion size. I split the suadero and barbacoa tacos  4 each  along with cutting the quesadilla in half with my husband and was plenty satisfied. The tacos are small  but so loaded with flavor  I don t think most would be disappointed with their size.   All in all  I can t wait to come back and see they are selling tacos by the pint. Don t miss out - the suadero are 100  worth the splurge 
Suerte,318,Met a friend here for brunch and it was divine  We were immediately seated on their patio and were greeted right away. I had a margarita  it was everything I wanted it to be and more  We started off with their morning roll which was the highlight of the meal  It was huge  Perfect for sharing and definitely satisfied our sweet craving  I ordered the chilaquiles and they were absolutely delicious  So much flavor  Service was fantastic  I m so excited to go back to try their dinner menu 
Suerte,319,Suuuuper great brisket tacos and watermelon sangria  on tap    . Ambiance was nice  even though we had to sit outside  we didn t make a reservation  - but they have misters  I freakin  love misters. Are they even called that  Probs not. I m not talking about humans of the gentlemen version. Not that kinda misters. The cool spritz of water on your sticky mosquito bite covered body- those kinda misters. Although technically there were both kinds.  Ahem. Anyway. Our server was amazing and I also loved the ceviche  Awesome date spot   
Suerte,320,Suerte is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin. The menu is carefully curated to include fresh ingredients that are in season  so it is frequently changing. I love the tlacoyo. It is my favorite fish here. The lentil appetizer is also delicious. The fish a la devil is a great option if looking for a main course. I have yet to make it for lucky hour or mezcal Monday s  but it is on my to do list 
Suerte,321,Ordered Suadero tacos because of taco chronicles  who wouldn t love brisket confit    Turns out  me  I really wanted to but the best part about the taco was the tortilla. They were super salty and the guacamole topping was over powering with the extra heavy bitter lime. The chicken tacos were asada style and the chicken wasn t any better than something you d get at an asada chicken food truck. I don t mind paying for delicious food but I m sure I could ve gotten something better off Lamar. The tortillas were really good though  Michilada was okay at best but only  6 so I ran with it. Unfortunately this is probably a one and done for me  the ambiance is nice and the staff was super friendly and attentive.
Suerte,322,Dining in or for takeout - the suadero tacos are hands down the best suadero tacos I ve had since having been in Mexico city.   The other tacos are also tasty  but don t miss out on the Suadero. Chef Fermin is a genius for having perfected this taco. The flan is also perfection   If you re dining in  the ambiance is ideal for a date or a evening with friends.  Highly recommend 
Suerte,323,If you carry a hip  amp  cool meter with you  you ll definitely get your money s worth out of this place. On a Monday night it was loud  amp  packed  and every buzzword was in play  Trendy  Vibrant  Millennial  It s easy to see why Suerte is on most top ten lists  and I m a fanboy of impeccable service  complimentary valet  and community seating for walk-ins. All the traits of my favorite Austin restaurants.  I just wasn t in awe of the food. There wasn t anything bad  but nothing that made me want to stand  amp  proclaim  I LL BE BACK FOR MORE OF THAT   Know what I mean  At this particular price point in Austin  you expect colorful combinations and IG-worthy picture plating. But for me at this particular price point there s got be a tiny bit of  OMG  IT S A PARTY IN MY MOUTH   kind of feeling. That just didn t happen here.   I won t dispute it may be partially my fault  because I don t drink and I was told their  Sargento Pepper  along with a glass of Envinate Albahra during dinner would have made all the difference. Probably. But until that time  I m perfectly content to tag along if you want to check it out. And whip out your own hip  amp  cool meter.
Suerte,324,Can t go to Austin without having Mexican food once right  RIGHT  Suerte is the currently hot  amp  new place to dine at so naturally I found myself there on a Saturday evening around 830PM. Bonus is there is complimentary valet however also street parking if needed. I was told there was a wait of 45 mins to upwards of 1 hour but we actually probably only waited 35 mins  which was awesome. During your wait  a lovely staff member does offer a drink menu   brings em  to you  BONUS.   I did start with a watermelon rose sangria  which was delicious. Its super refreshing and light.    2 2 - Food 1. We started with the aquachile prawns  and the ceviche. The aquachile prawns were out of this world. The prawns were fresh  and the chili sauce was full of flavor and depth. Next  the ceviche was good but it wasn t anything to write home about. The sauce was mild and did not overpower the fish which was lovely  it was more modern ceviche versus your yams   corn one. Our entrees included the  green chorizo tlayuda  white bean refrito  quesillo  almond  pumpkin seeds  and the suadero tacos  confit brisket  black magic oil  avocado salsa cruda . The tlayuda   tacos were MAGICAL. The tlayuda was crispy  refreshing with all the greens. The brisket was soft  tender kickin  with flavor.   0.5 1 - Value  Everything was priced appropriately however I felt that a  16 ceviche deserved more than 4-6 pieces of fish. While the ceviche was ok  I would skip out on it for the price point.   2 2- Service  Service was phenomenal. The hostess did seem a bit overwhelmed with the amount of people coming in for a table though. Our server  Jackie  cute as a clam  gave the best recommendations. After our apps  we ended up waiting approximately 20-30 mins for our food  which is quite long. Jackie handled it  and the manager  Aaron  came over and spoke to me about it. He ended up comping our entrees  which to me went above and beyond.   Overall  it was just a positive experience. 100  one of the best restaurants I ve been to in Austin  and I ll definitely be back again.   Happy eatings 
Suerte,325,This place tries too hard to be fancy Mexican and just misses its mark. Don t get me wrong  nothing tasted bad but it just wasn t what we wanted or expected.  This place was very crowded on a Wednesday night so I recommend calling ahead. We got sat and started searching the menu. A lot of their menu items are fairly regular but their description is complicated  making you second guess exactly what it is. We got chips and salsa and it turns out it was nacho style with this extremely spicy salsa. I love spice but this stuff was overwhelming and absolutely overpowered your taste buds. I had to drink a ton of water and wish we could have controlled the spice by dipping chips into salsa instead of not being able to avoid it.  For our mains we got the goat tacos  zucchini quesadilla  and the mushroom something  I say it like that because I absolutely could not figure out how it was a mushroom. It looked like a big fried cauliflower with calamari like branches with a slight taste of mushroom. As I mentioned before  it was just way too confusing and unnecessary. The quesadilla was good and I enjoyed the true Mexican style cheese. My friend liked his goat tacos as it was styled like barbacoa and the tortillas were amazing.  At the end of the day  these  tapas  are super expensive and to get a good sized meal you have to spend a bit much  by Austin standards. The food itself is OK but if they stuck with just being truly good  upscale Mexican I would respect it more than this.
Suerte,326,Delicious small plates and cocktails  Staff was very friendly  and the bar manager even came over at one point to help walk me through their mezcal menu when I was uncertain which to choose.
Suerte,327,My friends have been raging over this place for me to try. So I was finally able to get a table for 3 since Suerte is always packed. I have to say the hype was really high compared to the food. The plates were overly priced for the very small portions. I ordered the chamorro tacos and only 2 tacos came with very acidic salsa for  26  Not worth it. My friends got the suadero tacos and huarache which was again super small in portion but pretty good. I was not full from getting just two tacos so I ordered additionally a chicken mole and the azul quesadilla for my friends. It took 5 plates for us to have a real dinner full meal. The drinks were delicious though  The hibiscus tea and their tequila is pretty good. All in all I think Suerte has great scenery to enjoy some drinks and a food style appetizer based on their small dishes but I don t think the price resonates with the portions. Maybe I ll give it another try in the future but I wasn t impressed. There s other Mexican style food places out there that are just as delicious with better portions and price.
Suerte,328,Beautiful space and amazing service. Cocktails were delicious. As well as the Colimita beer which I ve never seen or had before. One of the best Mexican beers I ve had. Food was delicious but definitely on the pricier side of things. The Aguachile and the brisket tacos were stand outs. The charred beets were terrible dried out  with over powering bad flavor . Would recommend for nice night out but believe there is probably better Mexican food in town for a better price depending what you are looking for.
Suerte,329,Where do I even start    HOLY MOLY. I went here for my birthday  made a reservation cause of covid. They are only serving tacos and quesadillas right now. I ordered the salsa and guacamole appetizer and suedero tacos. Not to mention they ground fresh corn every morning for their chips and tortillas    I can t even articulate the flavor. It s so damn good. And their dessert     I ordered the tree leches cake and it did NOT disappoint. I can t wait to go back and hopefully they expand their menu so I can try other dishes    Seriously cannot wait to come back.
Suerte,330,Amazing vibe and food  I ve been wanting to try this place out because a lot of ppl recommmended me that this is the best tex mex place in Austin. I recommend making reservations because it does get full pretty quickly.   My friend and I ordered cocktails from the happy hour menu - they run daily 5-6pm. I don t remember seeing food menu on the happy hour menu.  We also got ceviche as appetizer and duck breast and quesadilla to share. Ceviche was amazing  fresh  and juicy. The duck breast and the quesadillas were not in the forms that I imagined but they were still awesome. I really liked the crispy tortilla.   Overall I do recommend this place because they have good service and pretty interior but I prefer ATX Cocina  a place often compared with Suerte   mostly because ATX has a bit more variety of food  but these two are almost equally good 
Suerte,331,great atmosphere. bland food. slowish service  agua chili has no chili flavor even though it s supposed to be made with habaneros   tacos are not better than most food trucks  cocktail service way too slow  cinnamon is the main flavor of the chocolate taco   meh especially when paying this much
Suerte,332,After seeing the taco chronicles volume 2 episode 1 on Netflix  my husband and I decided to try their suadero tacos to see what the hype was about and OH MY GOD... they are absolutely delicious    Everyone has got to try them  I come from California and I had not found a decent taco place anywhere in Texas until I came here. I understand this isn t your typical taqueria but the suadero tacos are like a piece of heaven. They are so good and full of flavor. I can t say the same for the other entrees on their menu. When we come here we ONLY come for the tacos. So far I ve taken all my friends here to try them. Also you need to try their flan  it s so creamy and delicious  You need to try it when peaches are in season  absolute favorite place to grab lunch in Texas so far 
Suerte,333,Overpriced for not good service ...the menu is definitely not for vegetarian although Yelp has that option .. the food was bland and over processed with cheese   the server basically had no recommendations and felt he was doing favor bringing food for us on table
Suerte,334,What wonderful celebrations of masa lie behind the colorful door to Suerte. The place has put a focus on an integral ingredient of Mexican cuisine that is often overlooked or treated as just a vehicle for other foods and nothing else. These guys have put a beautiful focus on a versatile product that does have unique flavor when treated correctly.  We came here for my birthday during their happy hour  which is from 5-6  and started with some drinks like the Don Dario  which was strangely sweet due to the tamarind  followed by a shot of mezcal paired with their house suerte lager. The classic margarita  draft paloma and draft rose sangria.   We shared plates of the chorizo molotes  which were my favorites  though they did not look appetizing. They are black masa filled with chorizo and topped with a gribiche  egg salad sauce . The chips and salsa came out like an intimidating tower  each individual thick corn chip soaked in spicy salsa hiding under a snowstorm of shredded cheese and pickled vegetables. I love this dish for its textural variance  the pop of acid from the vegetables and the texture and thickness of the tortilla chips. We tried the taco of the day which was some meat with a pecan sauce which were really nice  though they were really tiny and came 2 to an order. Finally we split up the blue masa quesadilla filled with onions and basil and other things that I can t quite remember.  For my birthday they brought out hot  fresh churros with chocolate sauce. They were awesome  Not too doughy or heavy and the perfect tiny size and amount to finish off a good dinner with friends. I honestly cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu.
Suerte,335,Ok So since I m back in Texas for a well deserved vacation I made some time to take a quick Roadtrip to Austin after watching the Taco Chronicles on Netflix. Went on Tuesday. Ok so from the start the experience this place offers and sells it s very top notch on my opinion. The hostess was very charming and seat me promptly I must add that since I read this place can get packed I went there at 4pm right when they opened for the evening so I didn t have to wait or make a reservation since it was just me. Also for all that people like still cares and have some concerns yes they do space out the tables inside the restaurant and have outdoor seating too and the whole place was really clean and neat and they had sanitizer handy and it was required to wear your mask if you had to get up and leave your table  Nice   My waitress who I forgot her name but she was super nice and new her stuff good informed about that Tuesday the have the Taco Tuesday specials and the special of the day was a collaboration with a chef from Sour Duck Market and it was called Cheesy Gordita Cronch and it was good but not mind blowing IMHO the flour tortilla could have been better and as well could have used more meat I felt like the onions ratio kinda overpowered the Taco and as well the corn tostada was super good I still think it was an interesting creation the piqu n sauce was what I enjoyed the most but since I also hear it was for a good cause and to support local business it passes on my book. Also before I forget since I haven t read about it on the reviews the courtesy bottle of water they use that s Awesome to me that set them apart from other restaurants  yes it s good water and it s slightly carbonated  and I also got me the El Berto Lager I ve been disconnected from the Texas craft beer scene for a while so I m trying to get back on track and I can tell you the beer it s super good pairs perfectly with the tacos and of course they also have a wide variety of drinks and wine and Mezcal  If I had a designated driver I would have tried it for sure  but next time . So then of course I had to order the Suadero Tacos and yes they are good. Believe the hype now yes granted it s not the best taco in the world that I ve tried but I can tell you this is easy one of the best tacos in the USA and for people that complains about the price come on guys sometimes you pay about 3 to 5 dlls for a potatoe and egg or Carme guisada with cheese so you get what you pay here and then some. The meat was super good and I don t know if you can do it but what I would suggest so you can enjoy it better  This is just my opinion  I would order one plain Taco just the meat then one with meat and onion and cilantro and then 2 all the way that s so you can enjoy everything better  optional of course  my only regret was not having room to enjoy dessert the flan looked delicious but that s for the next time for sure definitely they have something special going on at this place and I m glad somebody from Mexico it s being successful and making stuff his own way that another thing that it s a big plus for me. This it s an excellent place for a meal before going somewhere else nice spot for something nice and romantic  business related as well and to go on your own or with the family. Hands down it s a must if you are always looking for the awesome taco experience. And can t wait to go back as soon as I can pref with a DD. Cheers and Keep Austin Weird 
Suerte,336,Let s start with the good. The ambiance of Suerte is lovely. Service is good too. The drinks were probably the best thing about coming here. I had the Uruacoco cocktail which was tropical and smooth made with sugar rum and coconut  The prices were overwhelming  I feel like the prices are similar to LA or London and it s a bit crazy for Austin the south. For dinner I had the Campechano  14  Suadero  14 tacos and the side dish Esquites  12. Each taco order come with 4 mini tacos. Tacos were dry. The portions were just too small. I would consider this meal an appetizer for anyone with an normal appetite this will not do.  the side of Esquites was highly underwhelming and weird. I hated it. There was melted Gouda on the Esquites   not very appetizing. The waiter compared it to Elote which it was NOT. It tasted like creamed corn and a sprinkle of pepper. I m not impressed and would not return for a meal only drinks at happg hour since the prices are awful.
Suerte,337,This place was super delicious  like every bite was the most tasty bite ever.  The staff was very attentive and super helpful. The place was very pretty and chic  inviting. I got the sopes  the lentils and the tacos   Which again everything made me super happy. . The only downside was the portion sizes were small but I guess that s what you get when you are fine dinning. So It was super good but I was still hungry an hour after lol and I spent a pretty penny .  . But great place for date night or bites before more food lol  I could just be an over eater
Suerte,338,Finally managed to get in here on a Saturday at lunch time. Place was full on the inside  but the hostess quickly got us a seat at the bar.  The bartenders were great  explained the menu concept to us  and gave us some recommendations on drinks.  The michelada is exactly what you want  my only nit was that it would have been nice to have a dark beer option like negra modelo  but the lager draft and mix were perfect - spicy  tart  and cool.. My wife liked the Mexican martini but enjoyed the custom tiki cocktails they made for her as well.  It was a brunch menu since it was before 3. We started with the guac  which was impossibly rich. They are using magic avocados or doctoring it with an oil which is seamless but completely elevates the dish. The crispy masa was a step above any basic tortilla or chip.  The longaniza kolache was a surprise. The filling was super rich  with a lot of breading. The surprise was the crispy garlic that set off the filling in a delightful way. It was very good.  The suadero tacos were just a stunning dish. The tortillas are light but hold together great. The black magic oil brings the suadero together in a completely unexpected way with more of that amazing guacamole. I was just embarrassed by how much I enjoyed them.  The beef shank rancheros were fantastic. Egg perfectly fried  broke open to cover the dish  which I would have sworn were short ribs. The black salsa and pickled onions were perfect contrasts.  Somehow we still had room for a little dessert  they were out of the tarta  but got us the carrot tres leches off the dinner menu. It was rich but not overly sweet  the fried shaved carrots showing a master of mixing textures in unexpected ways.  It was a perfect afternoon. Easy parking on the street  they also have a small lot   quick seating  a place that could easily be snooty had an excellent staff who took service seriously  insanely good food. Chef Nunez was there and running food.   I can t wait to go back.
Suerte,339,I ve been twice and I love that Suerte doesn t conform to pairing traditional ingredients. There s actually chef-ing  totally a word  going on  which is a thrill to be a part of. And yes  the portions are on the smaller side  but that s what makes it more of a tasting than a gluttonous meal   Sad they took the chips and salsa off the menu since my first visit but apparently too many folks sent it back  because it was unique...like a tower stack vs a bowl . I d like to start a campaign to bring them back...I m pretty sure I can get both sides of the aisle to come together on this one  It s a nonpartisan issue  for sure.  Outside of that  I love the environment. The service is phenomenal...they must work off a CRM Salesforce style customer POS because every notation  dietary restrictions  reason for celebration  etc  is made available to every staff member who is running food or beverages to the table. Outstanding touch that really makes you feel more like a guest than a customer.   The burrata bean dip is their sophisticated take on queso and as a bonafide burrata inhaler  I approve. A great way to start off the meal.  The brisket tacos come as a pack of 4 and while some of my party thought they were a tad bit salty  I dig all the sodium  so I loved them. Someone also asked for salsa so they brought out two of their hottest ones  and that was a smart move  so do that  too.  The mushroom tlacoyo was a repeat from my first visit and while I would never order it based on the description alone  it s my favorite thing on the menu. The flavors blend so well together and everyone seemed to be a fan.   I almost forgot about the sweet corn  Another fave of the table...the corn is served off the cob and is sweet  but when mixed with the corn dumpling  charred shishito peppers  and the cheese  looks like carrots but was a hard  aged cheddar-like fromage  it cut the sweetness and made for a more savory dish.  The fish a la devil didn t look like the rest of the photos I ve seen of it  so I think the presentation has either evolved over the year and or it really just depends on what is available fresh that day. It was a solid entree  but I d recommend going for something a little more adventurous.  The dessert was a bust  but we forced ourselves to order it because we were there  so I think we could have ended with the savory and been supremely satisfied.  They were very kind and took it off our bill even though it had nothing to do with execution and more to do with personal taste.   I went with wine during this visit and wasn t blown away by their red choices  tried three   but I ve been during happy hour before and their cocktails are concocted with as much care as their food menu  so I d recommend going that route.    Lucky Hour  is every day from 5-6 PM  featuring  5 Snackcidents and  6 cocktails.   They also just started Mezcal Mondays  featuring half-priced mezcal copitas  plus familia pours from featured producers.
Suerte,340,Cute spot on the east side  We came for their happy hour and sat at some communal  first come first serve tables near the bar. We only ordered the food off the happy hour menu.  Overall the food was decent  and the taco of the day was quite tasty. Half of the HH dishes were chips in some form. The corn appetizer was really good too but seemed tricky to share. One of the dishes had fish in it but something tasted a little off.  Service was really nice  Our waitress was pretty cool and seemed happy to serve us. Next time I ll have to try some dishes on the regular menu 
Suerte,341,Had a reservation for 4 on NYE this year at 8 15pm and we weren t called to be seated until 8 55pm  Keep in mind it was a holiday with a preset  prepaid meal. We basically were asked to hover waiting by the hostess awkwardly the entire time. By the time we made it to the last course it was almost 11 30pm and we had to ask for our dessert to be wrapped up to go because of how long everything was taking - we had midnight plans because duh NYE. The price   150 per person    90 servers fee  wouldn t have been much of an issue if everything wasn t so unorganized and sloooow. Hopefully they can improve this moving forward because the food was delicious.
Suerte,342,I must admit  I am not the biggest fan of Mexican food. But Suerte has clearly changed mind.  I had no idea what to expect upon walking in. But it was happy hour  and when they started playing old school hiphop as background music  I knew I was in good hands.   Highly recommend  Beef Tartare Sopes  Chile Chilhuacle - incredibly tasty. This HH special set the tone for the rest of the dining experience.  Taco del Dia - shrimp and eggplant on corn tortilla.    Tostada Mixta - similar to ceviche  but not too tart. Had various types of seafood  with a spicy kick from the jalape os.  Unimpressed  Duck Breast Y Mole Negro - not sure if it was because it was the last dish to arrive  and we were just about full.. but this missed the mark for me. While the duck was tender  the mole sauce lacked flavor.
Suerte,343,Delicious food  friendly staff  beautiful space.  I had some taquitos - wonderful tortillas  made in-house   delicious chicken and chorizo  beautiful salsas. Then  the seafood  coctel  - with a spicy sauce and radishes - so fresh and good  with crispy tostadas on the side.  Oh  and the Don Dario  is that the name   was a delicious margarita - went so well with the food.
Suerte,344,Came for brunch . 2 people had the shrimp avocado toast . Amazing  I had the pork huevos - was so delicious . I would love to come back for lunch and dinner. The lemon Meyer curd stuffed donut is to die for 
Suerte,345,Suerte is just the best.  Suadero. Mole. Cokteles. Mezcal. Tacos. People. Ambiance.  Giant damajuanq chandelier. CHOCO TACO GUEY  come eat here or fuck you
Suerte,346,Suerte is good  but is it  4 taco good   Now this one was legitimately interesting  as the wife and I diverged quite a bit in our opinions. But first  a protip...  Pro-tip  Don t use Suerte s online booking. It rarely shows any availability. Act like human contact doesn t scare you and pick up the phone. Not only were we easily able to get a table on a Friday night  but there were 3 or 4 vacant tables around us as we ate. It s a hot restaurant  but not that hot  apparently.   Onto the food. The suadero tacos are good. Really good. But so are the duck tacos. Personally I thought the nice punch of citrus put the duck tacos in the lead  but my wife felt like the duck was still too rich.  We were again split on the tetela. The wife found it to be incredibly well flavored  while I felt like it was a bit bland. Disclaimer  I had this immediately after the suadero tacos  so my definition of  rich  might have been badly skewed.  We all agreed that the chips with lentils yogurt was a bit of a disaster. Not enough chips  and the ones that were provided were fragile and snapped off before you could get any condiments.   Now credit where credit is due  Suerte doesn t lean on the  drown it in cheese  ethos that a lot of  4 taco places do. They really seek balance in each dish  like the chile watermelon broth in the ceviche  but if I m honest   it doesn t always work.   Speaking of balanced  I thought the drinks  Nada Paloma and the Don Dario  were very well executed  but the wife found them to be incredibly sweet.   Now  culinarily speaking  there s nothing wrong with swinging for the fences and missing. But the trip really nose dived with our server. Our group of 7 was there for three hours  and the last hour it was readily apparent that they were trying to boot us out. I get it  prime time on a Friday  but there were two empty tables to either side of us. When we reviewed the bill  there were a few extra drinks on the tab that no one ordered. Boo.  How was it overall  asi asi There were some highs and some lows. The  lucky hour  really is a good value though  and I think some service at the counter  a taco and a drink or two might prove to be a much better experience.
Suerte,347,Hit all the right notes. The brisket tacos are the stuff dreams are made of  as were the sashimi dishes  - truly. The outdoor seating options and service were a little hit or miss  but the bathroom wallpaper made up for it.
Suerte,348,After seeing this place on Netflix s Taco Chronicles  we decided to try out Suerte during a recent trip to Austin. Due to Covid  we decided to take our food to instead of eating in  perhaps that played some part in my experience  I had very high expectations but was left disappointed and unsatisfied.  The tostada with tomatillo salsa was flat. I didn t find anything interesting about the  house heirloom corn tostada.  The zing was in the tomatillo sauce but not worth the  12. Even my 4 year old who normally loves tortilla chips was unimpressed.   Open to eating healthier  we had the calabaza tacos. I wasn t sure what to expect but was happily surprised. The squash was perfectly grilled and complemented well by the feta. By far  the best thing we ordered.  Suadero tacos  this was the reason why I was here.  Netflix made it look and sound so intriguing - black magic oil  confit brisket - that  I had to try it. The brisket was cooked to perfection and ultimate tenderness but the black magic oil is just a slight of hand. Overall  the taco was just ok and on the salty side. I m no stranger to fermented black beans and know they can be salty  but the trick in using them is knowing how to balance their impact with softer flavors for maximum taste. The black magic oil is just a trick and definitely no treat.  Lastly  the dorman and hostesses were top notch and provided great customer service.
Suerte,349,This restaurant always delivers   Before COVID and during all stages of changes they have adapted to everything gracefully. The staff is super knowledgeable about mezcal  and the food is to die for. The flavor profile of all the dishes makes each plate well balanced.  We first had the Chicken Mole when it was on special a month ago  and we were excited it was back on the regular menu last night. The special entree of the day  fish durade with caper relish  was excellent.  While Suerte had run out of the mezcal flight that initially brought us to dinner yesterday  we were pleased with the alternate option they provided.  Pictured flight of Cinco Sentidos is from August  I would also like to mention the waiter  Lyle  provided the best customer service and was accommodating in every way possible.  We will definitely be going back for another Mezcal Monday soon  - If you are new to mezcal  this is a great way to dive right in 
Suerte,350,Where do I start  Let s start with drinks  Nada Paloma is a perfect blend of 2 Tequilas  YES 2  Holy Moly this is good  We ordered the appetizer chorizo papas little cups of heaven    The Suadero tacos sealed the deal  Thank you  Suerte for making our date night so special  Blessings to you and your business  Great attentive service 
Suerte,351,I echo the previous comments. The  craft  take on Mexican cuisine is there but not worth a 16  tamal. Food is  good  but nothing that another authentic Mexican mom and pop can top. If you like fancy pants atmosphere and the creative drinks  This may be a place to go. Other than that  prepare for a large tab haha
Suerte,352,I got the suaredo tacos - I didn t have a chance to take a photo because I ate them so fast. Quite possibly the best tacos I ve had in Austin. Will be bringing my friends back  definitely a new favorite spot  Need to go back for happy hour specials.
Suerte,353,Quickly becoming one of my fave Austin restaurants  I ve had 4-5 different menu options and really enjoyed them all  Cocktails are on point and the staff is genuinely kind and interested in what they are doing    Great place when you wanna impress or just enjoy some food prepare with love 
Suerte,354,I didn t not like their version of tacos de suadero. We did like guac and the chips. The margarita that i had  the  signature  just to bland for me
Suerte,355,This is a very nice place  has the  fancy  restaurant  bar feel but it s Mexican food. The suadero tacos May look small but they very filling and the flavor is on point. The horchata is probably one of the best I ve had  not watered down at all. I was feeling the atmosphere too  very welcoming and it s good vibes with a mixed crowd. Definitely recommend.
Suerte,356,Food was delicious. But ridiculously over priced everything. Go to the taco truck  amp  save yourself some    . Good food doesn t have to be expensive. It s just a trendy place.
Suerte,357,I really liked the vibe of Suerte  great service  great drinks  we had a couple of the house margaritas that have a very unique taste . Unfortunately we started with with the tuna toastada which was not good. To be fair  anything on top of the toastada was good BUT the actual toastada was SO HARD I could barely chew on it. I was afraid to break a tooth so I had a bite or two and set it aside. Luckily everything that followed was delicious. I don t remember the names of all the dishes as we ordered a lot of them to share  but most of them are displayed in my pictures. I would highly recommend to come here and just avoid that one dish.
Suerte,358,Oh my SO good on every level.  We had a reservation  showed up on time and were seated immediately at a nice table for two. Our server was super friendly  positive and on top of it.  They were fairly quick with our drinks - spicy margs - which is such a clutch move and we always appreciate when restaurants nail this  get cocktails out quickly and chances are the table is gonna be happy for a while... buys the server some time .  The drinks were great  the app was fantastic -- refried lentils and chips  also guac and chips  wow loved it. Fish tacos were to die for so good.  Complemented the server on her positive presence and ended the night having a really nice conversation with her about relationships  acting  career  etc.  What a great experience - highly recommend.
Suerte,359,Food was amazing  our waiter  Ian  was terrific and got our very hangry children fed so fast we were able to enjoy our tuna tostada  gnocchi  and waygu beef tacos. The choco taco was made of my dreams and I would eat ten of them. I ve had better tres leches but my husband enjoyed it.
Suerte,360,Great set up despite the restrictions of COVID. We had long wait that was shorter that was shorter than they advised  always better to undersell and over deliver . The hostess served cocktails while we waited enjoyed the outdoor seating. We then had a meal at a covered picnic table. Service was excellent. Food was very good  but not mind blowing. The fresh made chips were exceptional as were the tacos. I recommend trying Suerte anytime.
Suerte,361,Un.Real. Went here with a friend and split the tuna tostada  suadero tacos  and the mushroom casuelita. EVERYTHING was awesome BUT the suadero tacos are easily the best I ve ever had. Like not even close. There s something special in that black magic oil. The don dario was really great as well. Went with tres leches for desert and again was top 3 deserts I ve ever had. The staff was great too  you can tell they love this place and are passionate about giving you a great experience. The whole experience was legendary--can t recommend this place enough.
Suerte,362,This place is beautiful and the service was fantastic. We started with the lentil dip with tortilla chips  it was fantastic. For dinner we got the carne asada and brisket tacos. We loved both however the carne asada was very overpriced for the amount we got. It didn t come with a side  just tortillas to make into tacos. We got deserts and they were very rich  I loved it. All the drinks were great. My favorite was the Don Dario because it went with all the food. Would definitely go back but I would stay away from the carne asada unless they lower the price significantly  paid  70  .
Suerte,363,This was incredible. I had had this place bookmarked for months before our Austin trip  and it easily exceeded the hype. We got the chips and salsa  the suadero tacos  the green chorizo tlayuda  and the goat barbacoa. Gun to my head  the suadero tacos were my favorite dish of the night -- they don t look like that much  but they just explode in your mouth. I don t know if it s the  black magic oil  or something they do to the brisket itself  but these were truly amazing.  The chips and salsa were probably next  for me -- unlike any other variations of  chips and salsa  you ll see  and all the ingredients  from the chips to the salsa to the cheese  were really fantastic.  We loved the goat barbacoa too -- this was probably my wife s favorite dish of the night. The fact that it s third out of four for me is more a statement on the other dishes than on this one. It comes in a similar style as the barbacoa   duck carnitas at Cosme in NYC  with some hot tortillas that you fill yourself. The barbacoa itself was excellent  as were the accompanying sauces. Next time around  I d be torn on getting this again  just because there are so many other awesome-looking items on the menu  but I m sure my wife would want to.  Last out of the four was the tlayuda  which  again  I really liked  but it just wasn t as incredible as the other three.   Overall  amazing food and really great service. We really loved this place.
Suerte,364,I really never write yelp reviews  unless I m dying to offer some praise to a business. And Suerte is my absolute favorite restaurant in Austin.  My boyfriend and I first went to Suerte to celebrate our sixth anniversary. We wound up going back to celebrate his 34th birthday too. I could talk about some of my favorite dishes and drinks- I loved the prawn crudo  the tlacoyo  the chips con lentils  the goat barbacoa  the quesadilla- but I m gonna focus on the curbside menu they re currently offering.  This month we were supposed to get married  but had to postpone due to the pandemic. So we ordered some meal kits from Suerte to mark the occasion. The suadero taco kit is a ton of food  and it s so incredibly delicious- the suadero is insanely flavorful  and it comes with a wonderful kale salad and some sides too. We also got the dewberry clafoutis kit  and the Don Dario margarita kit- all wonderful.   In addition to the meal kits  they re also selling ready-to-eat taco plates and quesadillas. They re curbside only  and their staff just place them in your backseat or trunk for you.  They re about  12-14 per order  so it s pretty affordable  especially considering the fine dining quality of the food.  Seeing so many local businesses reopen with practices that are unsafe for their staff as well as their patrons has been disheartening- which is why I really appreciate places like Suerte that have totally changed what they do to keep their people safe.
Suerte,365,I think it s frustrating that people can t see Mexican food as elevated. If you see the three dollar signs and still complain about the price  then I don t see how that s the restaurants issue. You can taste the freshness and the quality of every ingredient in every bite. Not only that but I love how creative they get with their dishes  My favorite was the peaches and mango with the green sauce and cheese. Overall I enjoyed the food and the experience for my dinner. Everything is served tapas style. The waiter was very attentive and really helpful. I would also like to say that this  reminded me of home. It was nice to have a Mexican meal since I feel like that s hard to find in the Tex Mex capital. This was a great experience and to me was worth every penny.   Oh and the drinks are fantastic 
Suerte,366,We ordered   Beef tongue triangle  Sweet Corn with masa dumplings Brisket tacos Mango and peach  Ceviche  Duck with mole  Everything was so good. My favorite is the beef tongue triangle thingie. The beef tongue was super tender and the flavor was tame. I liked the textures. The brisket tacos were either tied for best or second only because it was a bit salty unless the spice just made it seem saltier than it really is. Ideally  I would put the brisket meat on the beef tongue triangle.     The sweet corn was really good as well. I could definitely eat a huge bowl of it. Duck mole is pretty darn good. I m not a fan of super sweet mole. And I ve had really bad bitter mole. This one was quite perfect.     I m literally drooling writing this review. This place is hands down way better than Fonda San Miguel.
Suerte,367,This was a very hard review for stars because I would have to say that is is probably one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in Austin  but it is WAY too expensive... Maybe it is because we have been to Mexico City quite a bit and it is delicious there and WAY cheaper  we are talking  2 for one of the best tostadas you have had where at Suerte it is  13... for ONE tostada...   Ambiance Service  Yes  I can definitely say that the ambiance and service are extremely good here. It is a fun vibe spot  super modern  upscale  and the service was on it.   Food Drinks  Both the food and drinks were very good. My only disappointment was the cost. I just can t get around the fact that a small taco or a tostada would be over  6  it just blows my mind. I had a tequila cocktail which was also very good. There were 3 of us for brunch and we had 2 drinks each  an 2 appetizers to share and one course each and we spent just shy of  200...   I just really hope another restaurant comes around with authentic Mexican food  but for a reasonable price.   Unfortunately  because it is good and I occasionally need to get my fix  I will probably be back.
Suerte,368,I was really excited to try Suerte because I know so many people who have been and loved it. It really was a beautiful ambience  I love the interior. I wouldn t normally be adventurous with what I order but I have heard such good things I figured I couldn t go wrong with anything. One of the dishes I got was something with beef tongue and cream cheese  I personally just did not like the beef tongue. My margarita was absolutely amazing  and we loved the chips and salsa. Everything else we ordered was great  I just don t know if I would ever crave this meal again. But I will probably be back 
Suerte,369,BRUNCH Review  No trip to Austin is complete without a visit to Suerte for brunch and my most recent trip was no exception. The place is always packed when I go and for good reason-the food is exceptional.   Most dishes are pretty small and ideal for sharing and leaves you plenty of room to taste several different dishes and tacos. On this trip I tried for the first time the El Governator taco. Usually I m not a huge fish fan but I was feeling adventurous and I m so glad I was. The quesillo sauce served as perfect accompaniment to the fish  and it didnt have a fishy flavor at all  . My go-to  however  is the lengua taco which never disappoints. Honestly  I could 10 of them alone and be happy. The meat is cooked to tender perfection and the simple ingredients of tomatoes  refried beans  and corn tortillas combine together for flavor perfection. Speaking of the corn tortillas they are the best I ve ever had  I usually am not a fan but I don t know what it is about the tortillas at Suerte but I eat them by the basket when I m there. To finish out the meal  I ordered the pork y huevos dish. Another go-to of mine  this dish reminds me of down-home cooking at its finest. What s not to love about slow-roasted pork  potatoes  a delicious broth and a side of those delicious corn tortillas to wrap it all in. I firmly believe that there isn t a bad or mediocre dish on the menu at Suerte and I can only imagine how delicious the lunch and dinner offerings are. Do yourself a favor and add this place to your brunch rotation in Austin.  Pro-tips  ALWAYS make a reservation so that you aren t stuck waiting forever for a table and make sure to take advantage of the complimentary valet parking on-site.
Suerte,370,This new restaurant reminds me a bit of Uchi  but with elevated Mexican fare. Small shared plates is the style here  so I recommend you try this place with a few friends   The service we received was impeccable. Attentive staff helped explain the menu  saw to our drinks  and even cleaned our table of loose crumbs after a course.  As a table of two  we were satiated with the chicken mole  pork belly carnitas  and flan dessert. The chicken mole was incredibly juicy  with bits of crispy skin to die for. It did have more fat on it than I expected. But I was really impressed with how they cooked this chicken. The sauce paired with it didn t really taste of mole to me  and was more mild.  The pork belly carnitas had a nice sear  and the black fried corn on the bottom was to die for  In this dish  we were most impressed with the refried beans - creamy and well-presented. It definitely tasted more luxurious than any refried beans we ve ever had.  The flan was a beautiful texture  perfectly creamy. You can eat it with the crispy molasses topping for a rich and multi-faceted taste with a slightly bittersweet finish from the crisp. Or you can eat it with the mango sorbet for a light  refreshing bite.
Suerte,371,Pros  Delicious and unique spin on their food. Amazing wait staff.   Cons  There reservations fill up fast  and you may need to line up before they open to get a table  which just   they re sooo good    We ate here to celebrate our anniversary. Delicious delicious food  Can t wait to eat there again 
Suerte,372,Holy sh t get the suadero tacos ...thank me later . Best Mexican restaurant I ve ever been to.
Suerte,373,Had Sunday brunch at Suerte. A wonderful space with delicious and unique dishes inspired by Mexican classics.  Quality  I was impressed by the modern twists to Mexican cuisine served up by Suerte. Our meal started with cocktails  I went with a Almita Swizzle  with sotol  blueberry lemon oleo  chile pequin  and thai basil  while also having a few sips of Mango No. 5  with mezcal  Texas mango  hoja santa  lime  and egg white. Both tasty and refreshing. For appetizers we had the delightful Shrimp Tostada  which came with a kick  and the tender Lengua Taco. For our mains we had the Quesadilla De Aguacate  was my least favorite dish  I felt it came out too crispy and lacking in cheese. Luckily  the Duck Confit Flautas more than made up for it with moist and delicate meat and a wonderful rich mole sauce. Quantity  The left side of the menu tends to be smaller bites  but the entrees are sharable. Value   11 to  15 for Brunch Cocktails.  13 for the Shrimp Tostada.  3.50 for a Lengua Taco.  13 for the Quesadilla De Aguacate.  21 for the Duck Confit Flautas.  Ambiance  Suerte has a beautiful and bright space just east of Downtown Austin. High ceilings  big windows  and light colors give it a very welcoming feel. The inside area has plenty of tables as well as some bar seating looking directly into the kitchen. They also had a small outdoor patio  but it was far too hot on this afternoon. The music was relaxing and fun  perfect for brunch vibes. Crowd  Fairly busy during brunch. I would recommend getting reservations to ensure an immediate seat. Service  Great service. Our waiter was very enthusiastic about the menu and knew all the items on it. Parking  Complimentary valet parking is available.
Suerte,374,I wish I could give Suerte 10 stars. Everything we ordered was literal perfection. Service and food was awesome. I can t wait to go back.
Suerte,375,Just amazing  Beautiful place  amazing customer service and delicious food  I highly recommend the Chips Con Refried Lentils  Trust me  it was delicious though i was hesitant. A gem in Austin  Definitely will be back  
Suerte,376,So for the positive I love the way swear they looks I ve been here before I did not have a horrible experience although my friend was not happy with some of the food that she got and the prices it is pretty expensive however the happy hour does make a fort with the drinks the drinks were great the first time I had a taco I deafly think it was good but I m wondering if each time that you go if it s a different quality I am not satisfied when I go to a place and it s good and I return again and the food is dry and not very tasty not flavorful I expect each time that I go to a place that it taste just as good as the last that there is not a beat that s missed in when I go to a place and it s good and then I return and it s not as good I m not happy and I really wonder if I want to return to that place again to eat food so
Suerte,377,I m only writing 5 star reviews right now because of the pandemic but Suerte really earned theirs. It s a shared food type place so we ordered 3 or 4 dishes. The service was great and the pacing was awesome--if you re just two people they aren t going to bring everything at once. It s been a minute since we were there so I can t recall exactly what we ate but I remember loving all of it.   Without ordering alcohol we kept the meal under  50 for two people which I thought was very reasonable. I could easily have spent a lot more because their cocktail list looked amazing.   I hope they weather the pandemic and come out on the other side.
Suerte,378,Superb food.  Popular place  so expect loud crowds.  It is the kind of place that can survive the noise.  The food was excellent. Well presented with a very helpful staff.  Drinks were really well thought out and we just had a terrific dinner.  The brisket was so good we were considering some to go option  
Suerte,379,I m beginning to think horrible service is an Austin thing  but this place took the cake on bad service. Would avoid going on Sunday afternoon.. they only serve drinks and guacamole from 3-5pm.
Suerte,380,Ambience - 5 stars. Service - 5 stars - drinks 5 stars - food - 4 stars. It was nice to experience this place before I moved because I had heard so many good things about it. I love Mexican food and let me be clear  MEXICAN food  not Tex-Mex trash. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was very flavorful and overall delicious  honestly finished it in 5 minutes.. think that was my main issue is portion size  however it s common in restaurants that are  higher  end to leave still hungry lol. We had order the salsa trio for an appetizer and the salsa were good but I was not a fan of the type of tortilla chips.  Would I go back  Maybe  if it was what someone else wanted  but not on my own accord.
Suerte,381,Keith is an absolute doll and he helped me pick the BEST taco sampler as well as where to go after my meal. Half of the brisket  tender  flavorful  and half of the fish  my fave  crispy and spicy . The masa was fresh and delicious. Especially with limited seating due to COVID  make a reservation if you can. I didn t even check if you could  o 
Suerte,382,My mom and I went for dinner. Without reservations  we were able to be immediately seen by a bartender and put up to eat at the bar  full menu  . the waitstaff and bartenders were extremely attentive and helpful  and the food and drinks we got definitely proved worthwhile. We started with the sundowner and the don dario  both of which were refreshing and complex cocktails. The mushroom tlacoyo was a great combination of soft and crunchy textures as well as a balance between earthiness  from the masa  acidity from the pickled veggies  and bitterness from the mushrooms. The fish tacos were also superb  as the white fish was cooked perfectly  the sauce was smoky and fatty and complimented the fish well  and the tortillas they sent out were warm and as pillowy as I ve ever tasted from a corn taco. I definitely recommend giving this place a try 
Suerte,383,It s all true. Brisket Suadero  on its own terms is fantastic  amp  well balanced. You will be thirsty for hours though. Asked for a cosmo and lacking cranberry juice they used hibiscus to my delight. Service was spotless. Will go back a thousand times
Suerte,384,I love this place. Great ambiance. Would make a cute date spot. Love the location  love the food. It s more of Mexican fine dining  aka expensive and really small proportions   but it s really delicious and well cooked. I ordered the wagyu beef plate and it was cooked to my liking. Nicely presented too. I especially like their corn tortillas. Will be back 
Suerte,385,I m in love   There is not one bite of food  sip of drink  delivery of plates  restaurant service or amount of money spent that disappointed. Suerte is amazing  We decided to opt for lots of appetizers so we could try more options rather than just one big plate of food.  The service  thank you Madeline  was spectacular. How the hell do they time the courses to arrive at your table so perfectly  Our four  Vitamin T  appetizers began with a Carrot tostada  which was my least favorite  smeared with guac  pickled carrots  and peanut walnut yum yum sauce  sadly this sauce was the lesser of the flavors but what I tasted was delicious . Second  the Los Governator Taquitos arrived with snapper  potato  quesilla on a red chile tortilla. Hubby s fav. Thirdly  a luscious Carnitas Tacoyo aka  pork belly  refried beans  crema and salsa roja. Absolutely marvelous  Our fourth appetizer  Suiadero Tacos consisting of confit brisket  black magic oil and avocado salsa cruda was devoured by both of us.  Even though our bellies were full we just HAD to have dessert. The El Blondie was stunning. Do not pass Go just get it  A sweet yellow corn masa cake covered in merengue and topped with butternut squash ice cream. Unbelievably good    Did I mention this is another beauty by Sam Hellman-Maas  Owner of Barley Swine and Odd Duck. Another winner hits Austin.
Suerte,386,I ve tried to like to Suerte but they disappoint every time. All of their food is extremely salty  like so salty that you wake up in the middle of the night dying of thirst. Really ruins it. The chips and tacos were really oily also. It also seemed pre-made since our tacos were cold.  They have a limited menu now due to covid  which is understandable. But 1 order tacos  1 order salsa  2 tostadas  and 2 margaritas ended up costing  120. Extremely expensive for the poorly executed food.  Suerte also does not allow dine-in customers to park in their lot. They actually made me move my parked car from their lot because they insisted that the lot is for take-out customers only. I had to move it to the parking garage across the street  and pay  5 . And Suerte s lot was never more than a 1 3 full. They charged us a mandatory 20  tip after this. I m happy to support restaurants during after covid but they are not earning my business again. There are so many great options in Austin like Licha s Cantina down the street and Comedor that Suerte will soon be a distant memory.
Suerte,387,We found this place randomly while visiting Austin. It was SO good   The decor is great  mezcal flight was tasty and all our food was fantastic. Highly recommend.
Suerte,388,What a DELIGHTFUL place  My husband and I came here for a date night and it was AMAZING  I loved the food  every bite of it and the service was very friendly and knowledgeable   The ambience was awesome and I just loved the attention to detail by the servers there  they knew everything about the food we were ordering and about our drinks 
Suerte,389,Oh Suerte  How do I love thee  Let me count the ways.......your perfectly simple exterior in my favorite neighborhood to your warm and thoughtful interior is always welcoming. The velvety richness and unadulterated flavors of the Saudero Tacos to the unbelievably sublime  nuanced complexity and delight of the Tamal Mole Blanco is the dreamiest of all dreamy bites. Squash and Eggplant imagined and perfectly executed in your mind to our palates lingers long after the last bite..........the perfect char and smoke on that eggplant is truly unforgettable. And WHAT planet did that cheesecake float down from  So good that you have to slow down and microdose it because you want the experience to last forever   Oh Suerte  I really truly do love you  See you next time 
Suerte,390,Sweet baby Jesus this place is AMAZING. Ah-may-zing. We hosted a birthday dinner for 10 on a Saturday night. First off  we accidentally reserved for the wrong night  Friday  and the chef was so kind to accommodate a last minute change to Saturday. They were very understanding and kind about it. Off to a great start despite our snafoo.   For larger parties they require we go with the tasting menu for  45 person. It was INCREDIBLE  So much food for such a fair price. Like more than fair. We actually thought we must ve had it wrong... how could it be so cheap    It was 11 courses of heaven.   The specifics... everything was delicious. Seriously  everything. In terms of our favorites...   The chips with refried lentils and yogurt - unexpectedly tasty     Ceviche suerte - phenomenal.  Los governator taquitos - the BEST of the evening    Fish a la devil - simple goodness.  Carne asada - the BEST of the evening   It was a tie.    Grilled sweet papas - I never knew sweet potatoes could be so fucking good   And good Lord. When you think it can t possibly get better... it does.   El Blondie was so good  who knew - butternut squash ice cream is amazing  But the Coconut sorbet was hands down better and ridiculously delicious. Light  creamy  rich  crunchy goodness.
Suerte,391,I have mixed feelings about this place. - They don t take reservations  so coming with a group is a gamble.   Cocktail list is fun and I can recommend the  amor amargo  - Food is OK  though not particularly veg friendly unless you make a meal of starters and sides   Crispy sunchokes are a good appetizer to share   Ceviche was fine  though I wish it had a bit of spice. I couldn t taste any of the chile   Squash tamal was pretty and tasty- my fave of the evening   Pork quesadilla- meh. I like corn tortillas  but not as a quesadilla. This just tasted tough   Carrot tostada was another photo-worthy  and creative veg option. The taste didn t wow me  though   Mushroom frito wasn t my choice  I m not much a deep fry fan   Roasted broccoli was better  but not sure if it was  10 worth of veg   Grilled sweet potatoes were good  but very smoky which was unexpected   - Servers are friendly  but the food comes to the table at an odd pace  Glad I checked it out  but not a place I d go back to.
Suerte,392,When I say this was the best food experience I ve ever had  that is an understatement. Jonathan  our server  was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and was eager to offer suggestions based on our preferences. This is  high-end Mexican food done right 
Suerte,393,This was our first stop in Austin and we left feeling proud of our lunch choice. We went for Pork Y Huevo and Shrimp Tostada along with Palmer Con Cajeta  Palmer with caramel sauce  and these two are fantastic duo. They complement each other.  Everything we have shows perfectly orchestrated flavors. So fresh and ingenious.
Suerte,394,Only giving 4 stars because of price. The food is awesome. Very cute inside. We went for Mother s Day and it felt like a place worthy of Mother s Day lunch. Chips and salsa is actually so good. We went with the suadero tacos per my friend s recommendation and the rancheros per the waiter s recommendation. Both were delicious. Iced coffee was good but small. Really fast service too. There is a parking lot but it seems to easily fill up.
Suerte,395,I m having a hard time understanding the appeal of this place. Yes it s a beautiful space  but the food and service leave much to be desired. With the price point that it is  I would expect service to be stellar. Instead  we had a very disinterested waiter who needed much prompting to tell us about the menu items. Throughout our entire meal  our waiter checked on us once and we had to flag him down to refill our water. Where is the attention to detail here   Now onto the food-the very basic  overpriced  one note food. We came for Saturday brunch and ordered 5 plates. Not one stood out-not one.   We ordered the shrimp tostada  carnitas  duck mole flautas  chilaquiles  and the tangerine culler. They were decent but not enough to make me want to come back.  Let alone pay     for such small portions.   The saving grace is their cocktail selection. I had one of the brunch cocktails and it was delicious. I d definitely be up for grabbing drinks here  but would rather grab my food elsewhere.   Summary  cocktails are creative  food is overpriced and portions are small. Service is hit or miss.
Suerte,396,Okay  let s get this out of the way. Go to Suerte  eat everything  feel bliss. Be happy.   Space is fun  new  hip  well designed and flows nice. It can get a little loud inside because of the hard surfaces and angles of said fun designs. That said  it s not bad and should not make you not want to go. It s nowhere near as bad as other spots in town like Grizzelda s.   They don t have parking  just valet  but it s complimentary  so you should be good to go.   The cocktails are clever and fun  while well balanced and respectful to time-tested recipes and traditions.   The food is masa  corn focused. You ll see a lot of elements of corn across the dishes and they do it so so well.   Starters  get the chips in salsa. Don t be a dummy. When it arrives  be surprised and delighted by the experience you re about to have. The salsa is like a thin coating on the house-made chips and both are insane. Get them  eat them  order another order  be happy about it. Regret nothing.   Tacos. Eat them. Any  all  The brisket ones though... Woo  Goat dishes. They re doing some amazing stuff and you should not miss out. Don t like Goat  bring a goat loving friend and give it a try. The way they prepare it may sway you.   My only reason against Suerte is the price. I understand the time and effort that is going into the concept  the food  the drinks  everything. But I ve also seen similar caliber offerings at a slightly  5-10  less price point that makes all the difference. So  if Suerte could get those prices down a little bit I would be over there more and more.
Suerte,397,Came here after getting engaged in the fall. From start to finish  we felt like the only two guests in the room. Food was out of this world. Blue corn tortillas were fresh and new. Suadero tacos were melt in your mouth good and perfectly balanced. Cocktails  we had a Paloma and my husband had something with cinnamon and apple  were super tasty and fairly priced. Service was too notch. Looking forward to going back soon
Suerte,398,We ve heard so much about Suerte and we re so excited to finally try it  We loved our experience  the good was inventive and delicious. The service was also great  they were attentive  knowledgeable and welcoming. We thoroughly enjoyed our brunch  Highlights were   Duck confit flautas  mole negro sesame seeds cilantro egg  Torta de Milanesa  steak black bean puree avocado heirloom tomato chipotle pickles  Carnitas Taco  refried beans pork carnitas tomato
Suerte,399,We went here for my dads birthday during Covid so the menu was more of a taqueria style per our waiter so we didnt get the normal menu. However  it was still amazing. The chips are insane. We got big eyes and ordered everything on the menu for the table. Everyone at the table had a different favorite. The corn  quesadilla  and the brisket tacos were all fire. They even had homemade choco-tacos for dessert and it brought us back to my childhood. These were 100x better though haha.  Cant wait to go back when everything is back to normal so I can try there normal menu offerings.
Suerte,400,Came for Sunday brunch.  The service was great - 5 stars.  Ordered the 3 tacos available on the brunch menu. The lengua taco was by far one of the best tacos I ve ever eaten. 5 stars. The other two tacos were just okay. I would come back and recommend this place.
Suerte,401,1st impressions weren t great. My wife and daughter wanted to try it after seeing them on a Netflix series. We live a good 30 minutes away. I ordered dinner for 5 and it came to over  100. Okay  I ve spent more. I make my way downtown  they put my order in the back seat and everything seemed great.   I got home and pulled the bag out of the back seat. Hmmm. Feels a little light for all the food I ordered.   FML  Somebody else s order. Called  they were super apologetic but they didn t have anyone that could bring us our food.   Another hour later and a free tres leches for my trouble and I m finally home to a super hungry family.   You re probably wondering how all this lands us at a 4  rating   The food. FFS the FOOD.   The chicken was kind of basic but when you have young kids and a picky parent that s actually perfect. The little tortillas were great. The Campechano and Suadero meats were simply amazing. We have a little Campechano left over and that s going into eggs for breakfast. The salad had great flavors and was super fresh.   And that free tres leches for spending 2 hours driving between Brushy Creek and Downtown   Yummmmm 
Suerte,402,The food was outstanding  we ordered the tamal  my favorite   refried lentils  and the eggplant dish. I liked the flavors in the eggplant  but I wish it had been cooked longer so as to be softer. The drinks were good too  but wow pricey. We only ordered one. I think I ll go back for happy hour or food only. Cute place though  we did enjoy  just be prepared to pay  14 and up for mixed drinks outside of happy hour.
Suerte,403,Loved this place  Meals are definitely on the smaller side but if you get several dishes and share with friends then you can try many things.  I got the don dario and loved it     I ll be back for sure 
Suerte,404,A great upscale Mexican restaurant in Eastern Austin. Definitely recommend making a reservation especially on the weekend as it gets super crowded. It s more of a tapas style restaurant with plates to share. The chips with refried lentils were slightly salty but great as an appetizer  Next I went with the kale tostada that was a little hard to split between people  so I had to take alternating bites with my boyfriend. The cocktails are so delicious and come out so quickly. Very well made. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone that is visiting Austin 
Suerte,405,I kept hearing about Suerte. Austin Instagram pages  Facebook  the New York Times   I had to check it out for myself. My friend and I arrived at about 7pm on a Thursday and we were immediately seated  I had seen online that reservations were booked for the next 2 days  so I imagined it would be packed. The parking lot is valet  but we happened to find easy street parking. I already had a little bit of knowledge from my research that we were about to eat a lot of masa lol.   We started with the chips  cashew salsa and cheese. The chips were so fresh  The dish itself is served cold which I was not expecting  but it was very tasty. The salsa mixed with the pickled veggies throughout was great. We also ordered the Suadero tacos which were OUR FAVORITE. I m probably going to order those every time. The tacos were perfectly sized to eat 2 and then have room for more. The meat was tender and the guac was perfection. We then split the goat barbacoa. I loved how it is plated like a little build-your-own taco station. The meat was wrapped in a corn husk. Presentation beautiful so I had to snag a few pics. 2 hot sauces salsas  guac  housemade cheese  pickled veggies  mixed greens  amp  a lime. Everything was delicious  there was not 1 thing I didn t like. Since my friend  amp  I split everything to get a bigger taste  the bill was not bad at all  We also didn t try any of their cocktails  but that will be for next time   
Suerte,406,Not only is the food over the top   Our service every single time is immaculate. This last visit Pete was our server and I cannot brag enough on how positive our experience was. When I m town I will continue to come back every time   Beautiful restaurant
Suerte,407,Perfect service. Perfect food. Amazing atmosphere. Hand ground corn every day to create the corn tortillas. Best corn tortilla I ve had in my life.
Suerte,408,Brunch at Suerte was excellent   Make sure you make a reservation  given that the restaurant is super busy.  Here s what we tried  -Migas  The migas were amazing.  Instead of cheese  they use hollandaise sauce  which makes the scrambled eggs so creamy.  And the tiny corn tortillas they serve with the migas are both adorable and delicious. -Lingua tacos  These tiny tacos on corn tortillas are great--you get about three bites out of each taco.  The lingua meat is nicely cooked and crispy. -Pastry with caramel sauce  I can t remember the name of this pastry  but it was very good.  While the pasty was good  the tacos and migas were my favorite parts of the meal.  Service was nice  and they have complimentary valet  which is definitely necessary in that neighborhood.
Suerte,409,This was my absolute favorite place to eat in Austin. We had reservations for four and had to wait a little bit for the table to get ready but this place was worth the wait.   From the chips and salsa  to the tacos  to the wine  to the service  this was a fantastic meal. Everything was outstanding - everything.   Next time I m in Austin I ll make sure to eat here again.
Suerte,410,So yeah it s good.  It s not your run of the mill Mexican place.  You need to know that before you show up.  You re not getting free chips and salsa. You re gonna pay for some home made humongous chip that s really different but quite delicious.  You ll pay for the dips and they aren t anything like the salsa you re used too.  When they bring your food you might think   oh  that s not full plate like I thought I d get .  Do not worry.  It will satisfy you. The quality and freshness will be palpable.  To be fair the leches carrot cake was actually a big chunk of dessert.  Their version of a margarita was also nice.  It was called something else like Don something. It did not leave you feeling icky like you had too much sugar.  I recommend this place if you want to feel a little fancy but you want Mexican.
Suerte,411,Went here after hearing about how good their tacos were  but when we got there I realized they had a weekend brunch menu which appeared to have fewer taco options. But as it turns out  that was good because it got me to try something besides tacos and it was amazing   I got the pork y huevo and after eating all of the pork  hominy and egg  I used my spoon so scoop up all of the sauce  cleaning the plate as much as I could.   I also did get one taco  the lengua  beef tongue  and it was also really  really good    Not really what I came for but worth noting that the cup of coffee I had was really good as well.
Suerte,412,The best dining experience I have had in a while. Yes their prawns are incredible  the barbacoa was insane  and and the cocktails are creative and delicious  but what I can t get over is how amazing everything they do with Masa is. The masa is part of every dish including the blueberry  amp  masa sorbet  which you can t miss   and is just such high quality and so delicious. I want to just go into the kitchen and eat handfuls of it  it s just amazing. Such creative dining  an amazing experience  awesome wait staff  10 out of 5 stars if I could. Don t miss this awesome Austin dining experience
Suerte,413,The suadero tacos were amazing and the chips with the three different types of salsa are just the perfect starter for a great good experience.
Suerte,414,Holy smokes it was all soooo good  We had the fish tacos and carne asada   Atmosphere was beautiful   Can t wait to go back 
Suerte,415,Suerte  Masa  masa  masa  This place has my favorite tortilla in all of Austin and they re pumping out hundreds of them daily  Chef Fermin brings some amazing traditional Mexicano flavors to the East Side food scene.   This low lit  high energy  and very audible scene is a great vibe for date night  The decor is simple and captivating and the feel of the whole restaurant puts you in the mood to crush some Mexican cuisine.  The Suadero tacos are my favorite and I mean absolute favorite tacos in all of Austin. The Crab Tostada is an absolute must and DO NOT pass on the Arroz con Leche at the end  you will not be disappointed. Also  for those who enjoy Mezcal  Suerte has a great selection. They ve even started what they re coining as  Mezcal Monday s .  Half off all summer long 
Suerte,416,Superb service by the wait staff  food is spectacular. Went for brunch but evidently the Dinner is 7x s better and the entrees are shareable  Get the Sauerdo Tacos and or Ribeye Steak 
Suerte,417,Here s the lowdown  Suerte food is awesome  and after just one visit this place became one of my faves in Austin. Downside  You can get hit with really horrible service. That being said  I m a fan and would suggest you come anyway.  When we first came  we called ahead to see if we could go early and get drinks at the bar. The hostess said we couldn t sit at the bar  but we could be served drinks in their waiting area. We got there early  and realized 20 mins in that no drinks were coming  and that we were lied to. The worst part was that we went up to the host table and asked her about it  and she said she d get someone to come get us drinks  but it didn t happen. There was a waitress who came over and cleaned the waiting area  and she also said she d be back for drinks  but she never came back. And so an hour was wasted in the waiting area after reliance on their false information. Definitely not okay. There were other people in the waiting area snacking and drinking  so the service does exist  but nobody ever came to help us even though we were told twice they would. Anyway  onto the food.  The place is purportedly fusion  but honestly  that s just a gimmick. Both friends I came with  one Mexican  one Venezuelan  laughed when our food came out because it was so far from what they deem as authentic that they didn t even consider it fusion  but we all agreed that the food was still good.It s slightly annoying to see them try so hard to try to market this stuff to ppl who aren t cultured enough to know the difference  but it s fine.  Anyway  we started with the ceviche. The pieces were cut more like sashimi and there was none of that usual sour taste  I definitely would label it more as a crudo .  This was my favorite of the night and I m glad it started out so strong. The flavors complemented each other so well  and the presentation was seriously beautiful. Would definitely recommend this dish.   The rest of the food we got stood out less  but was excellent regardless. Taquitos were full of moist  delicious meat. A little greasy  but this was expected. It was my second favorite. The suadero tacos were a bit more disappointing. The brisket wasn t super special  and the avocado salsa cruda on top was weird. Not bad  but not great. One of our least favorites of the night. We finished with the carne asada  which was amazing. The flavors meshed so well for this dish  and the brown butter puree at the bottom was simply divine.  Service started out extremely slow and kinda bad  nobody came over for awhile   but then our server changed  and the service was noticeably better. Maybe it was just an off day for service  but that s fine  I didn t mind too much. Knocking off a star only because of the whole debacle with drinks at the beginning  seriously  not okay especially considering we wasted an entire hour after calling ahead to confirm they d do something they didn t end up doing . Otherwise  the food can kinda blend together  but it s over all good and unique enough that I would come back.
Suerte,418,Suerte came HIGHLY recommended from ATX locals and it was even better than we could have imagined  Each bite was better than the next. Still dreaming about these dishes   And the restaurant is beautiful.
Suerte,419,Holy cow. Service doesn t get better than Rachel at Suerte. And Suerte is the best     Mexican-inspired restaurant in Austin.   Super accommodating staff  idk how they pack so much flavor into the brisket  and y all know how much I love a good bathroom  this place also features my favorite  leave your guns at home  signage in the city .
Suerte,420,What a hyped up restaurant  A typical case of a Californian style pretty place with some innovation but zero humility  negative love  and no Austin culture. The staff seems to be imported directly from one of the snobbish LA restaurants.  They need to learn the Austin way or get the heck out of our city. Take my advise  skip this Broadway show and get Michelin star food at the Tamale House close by with beautiful people who would do anything to make a customer happy.  UPDATE-  Visited the place again and this time it was a much better experience as the manager took special care of us. He ensured that the same server helps us during our meal so that he gets a chance to turn things around. Definitely recommend it for brunch. The food was delicious and drinks were good too.
Suerte,421,To me this is a hipster gentrified version of food I love. Tbh I think people come here for the drinks.
Suerte,422,Worth the wait  We came in from New England and looked for a great place to try. This was it. We tried all the appetizers  the Carne Asada and one other dish.  They were delicious  Our waiter Jonathan was wonderful and made the dinner even better.  Drinks were poured a bit strong for my preference  for my age  I m a not-even-one-drink-wonder   but likely good for the younger 20 30-something crowd that this place is aimed for.
Suerte,423,It was great  Can t wait to go back.The food was awesome.Their salsa was so good. The breakfast menu is really good.
Suerte,424,Ohhhh. Mi amor. Mi corazon.   Steff and I were in Austin TX for 4 nights and we ate here TWICE.  2 of my favorite things ever  Tapas and Mexican.  Suerte  thank you.  That moment when you get sweet corn at a festival and it s done up all beautiful with the crema and paprika... and it s all over your FACE and running up your arms... and in your teeth.. and you re on a date... and you just wish you could have it in a cup... with a spoon... your dreams will come true here at this magical place.    The Fried Mushroom dish is out of this world. Don t ask me to tell you what was in it because the ingredients are all fancy but it was basically some kind of gravy   Man. Give me that.  A really good traditional mole  done correctly from scratch is tough to find.   Found  The brisket tacos were by far my favorite. The oil was spicy and the meat melts in your mouth. Ordered this on both visits.   The carnitas were done very well  crispy cubes of glory with refried beans and what i would describe as a Masa  pancake . Very tasty.  The peach salad had this zesty avocado sauce. Super bright and fun. Really enjoyed this at the end of the meal with my margarita thing. They have a cocktail that s their take on a marg. Recommend.   Walk next door to Whisler afterward for a night cap. You won t be sorry. See my review for Whisler.   
Suerte,425,So so good.  Oaxaca at its best  So good.  Shared a bunch of plates.   Mushrooms so good  brisket tacos a must.   The peach and mango salad would be amazing for a dessert  Cocktails are imaginative and yummy. Also just having some mezcal or tequila neat is always amazing to complete the eXp.  Make sure and set the expectation that it is different then  Mexican  or  Tex mex    Every ingredient was so so fresh - great staff as well.
Suerte,426,I have been eyeing dinner at Suerte for a few months now and since the reviews rave about everything from the service to the ambiance  I knew I couldn t wait any longer.   The quotes about the decor are spot on. It s such a trendy restaurant. They have a great vibe and even though the price-point and menu are similar to Grizzelda s  the feeling inside it incredibly unique. I love the open kitchen so you can see the interworkings of the food prep. The team in the kitchen are so tight-knit and a few times during our service we heard cheers  which I imagine was when someone bought the kitchen a beer.   We sampled a bit from each section of the menu. There were apps  tacos  entrees and veggies. We did it tapas style and shared the steak entree  the chips and salsa  a scallop dish  and the quesadilla. We didn t get completely full  but since it was pricey  we paired down our selections significantly. Overall everything was tasty  but nothing I d get again before trying the other stuff on the menu.   The noise is an issue  it gets loud. One of the reviews below had a business owner comment and he mentioned he was an audiophile and was putting up sound foam. It s there now and under the seats  but it s still fairly loud. I imagine it s a lot quieter than before though 
Suerte,427,Great drinks with just ok service and ok food. Solid choice but nothing too special.
Suerte,428,This restaurant was our favorite part of a trip to Austin. Can t stop thinking about it and going to try to go again. Loved the pistachio guacamole  Scallop appetizer  peaches done with green sauce. The tamale with a white mole was the only dish I wouldn t give the highest score to because the texture was not as fluffy as I would have hoped  but the tortillas and every other bite was to die for. And great drinks and service - bravo 
Suerte,429,This is my favorite restaurant in the city  the atmosphere is great super business casual perfect for a date or family time  wouldn t recommend bringing kids however   The staff is so sweet  your host will always make you feel welcome  you can have great conversations with the bartenders and waiters. The cooks obviously adore what they do because the food is full of passion.  Nothing to say but the best about this spot  if you re hungry this is where you need to be.
Suerte,430,This place is wayyy overhyped. They may use quality ingredients  but welcome to the 21st century. That is what it takes for any restaurant to stay alive these days. The only dish I remember eating here is the brisket tacos- which were indeed great. I forgot everything else within the next few days.   I heard there might be an affiliation with Barley Swine  which is an incredible restaurant  but we had to make reservations here weeks in advance and it was extremely underwhelming.  Recently moving to Austin and hearing people claim Suerte is the best restaurant in the city  and perhaps the US  made me confused and ultimately laugh at Austin s so called food scene.  This place is a good spot  the service is good  but the best restaurant   Uhh chill and drink another cocktail  friends.   It might  in fact  be my fault for having such high expectations  but for me this teeters between 3 and 4 stars.
Suerte,431,Two words  SUADERO TACOSSSSS     If you don t order them at least once during your meal...you are wrong.   Suerte never ceases to amaze me. The food  The service  The cocktails  This has absolutely become my favorite restaurant in Austin. The week they opened I went three times. It was just so good I had to keep going back  The staff is incredibly friendly  shout out to Joe and Celia . The ambiance is amazing. Best new restaurant in Austin for sure  Go here before it gets too busy to get a reservation    At this point  I have tried almost everything on the menu and to say it was all delicious would be an understatement. The suadero tacos  the goat barbacoa tacos  the fish tacos...ALL OF THE TACOS. The molotes  the grilled sweet papas  the mushroom frito. TRY IT ALL.  Pro tip  try the mango cake for dessert. It will change your life.
Suerte,432,Suerte combines diverse flavors of Mexico with local ingredients through thoughtful cooking methods. Suerte has outstanding service  accommodates dietary restrictions and requests well  and is some of the most unique Mexican food I ve ever experienced. Our favorites are the carrot tostada  lentIl dip  and oyster mushroom tacos. They are constantly adding new seasonal items to all of their menus  The server was knowledgeable on the menu and could answer questions and make sound recommendations. Great cocktail menu too. Suerte definitely lives up to the hype 
Suerte,433,Fermin the chef is bringing to you his marriage of D.F. Cuisine x Tex Mex. the lentils with yogurt were very nice  definite standout. The tostadas and tortilla chips stand well and he is using high quality masa. The margaritas were finished with a seasoned salt that really worked well. As for the suadero tacos  I would have chosen to use more of the black magic oil  we ordered extra  it was an up charge but I think they forgot include it ... I would maybe prefer to eat here post pandemic. The suadero leans 90  Texas 10  Mexico City. It is a brisket confit according to the menu  not suadero in the classic style. My partner is from Mexico City and he liked it  but it is fusion. I think that I would like to eat there after the pandemic rather than take out for greater depth of experience.
Suerte,434,Inventive and creative food rooted in authenticity. Went here for a girls dinner and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. If you get there early  5-6 pm  there is a daily lucky hour  which offers good prices on snacks and some drinks  which we were able to take advantage of. Our server was attentive and helpful with navigating the menu and ensuring we knew what we were getting and what his recommendations were. Here s what I tried and my thoughts   CHIPS CON REFRIED LENTILS  amp  YOGURT - a nice big bowl and tasted better than I thought just by looking at them - good balance of flavors and worth ordering  SWEET CORN ESQUITES CON GOUDA - fantastic  so much so  that we ordered two - stir them up and you ll have a flavor explosion totally worth it  CHIPS  SALSA Y CALDERA CHEDDAR - basically smothered and not the cleanest thing to eat  but amazing and flavorful  BEET TOSTADA - not my personal favorite  SUADERO TACOS - YUM  YUM  YUM  GRILLED SWEET PAPAS - delicious  but came out a little different than expected  expected them to be more on the crispy side   PEACHES Y MANGOES - lick the bowl delicious   ROSE SANGRIA - could have had a whole pitcher it was THAT good and THAT refreshing   All in all  this is a place I would run  not walk  back to. If you haven t been there  go...and if you have  make sure you keep returning so we can keep this gem around 
Suerte,435,OMG  The food is spectacular. Love this place  I wish it was closer to home The Rosalia drink and cured trout tostada is to die for  
Suerte,436,Great food. Great ambiance. Especially loved the lentil chips  amp  dip and spicy margarita. Will definitely be coming back soon.
Suerte,437,Wow  we can t say enough about Suerte  The cocktails are to die for and you can t go wrong on the menu  We loved everything and actually recommend the fish. Tacos were great but don t forget about the rest of the dishes  they all rock 
Suerte,438,I love this place  They are very knowledgeable with gluten free and vegan diets too and great service. My favorite restaurant in Austin 
Suerte,439,Probably one of the best meals I ve had in Austin. The suadero tacos are everything to me. WHAT IS THE MAGICAL DELICIOUS BLACK OIL     The Don Dario cocktail is absolutely amazing. The quesadila  aguachile  ceviche  lamb barbacoa...oh my god. amazing.
Suerte,440,Stopped in for dinner and drinks  the drinks were very good  I can t say the same for the food.  I ordered the suadero tacos and the brisket was very overdone and tough.  Even though the waiter was wonderful I can t recommend it for dinner.
Suerte,441,Service was really friendly  but food was not great at all. Both dishes we ordered for brunch were not served hot  more like room temperature . Salsas were too salty. Even the Bloody Mary was too salty like there was too much Bloody Mary mix. Expected much better for the price.
Suerte,442,Brandee was the best server ever  She made my experience very enjoyable and welcoming. Everything she suggested was spot on. This is definitely on my go to list of restaurants in Austin.
Suerte,443,I ve had dinner here before  but today visited for brunch.  The staff and ambience was superb as I ve experienced before.  Only reason for the 4 stars  some of the brunch items weren t as flavorable.  Items I wouldn t order again.  Given the brunch menu is so limited I wish they can be replaced with their more popular regular menu items.    Torta was not good.  Trout tostada was amazing.
Suerte,444,Five stars for the service. One star for the food. Sat on the patio and our server was super nice and personable. Decent michelada.   Came for brunch and left confused. Perhaps we ordered all wrong.   The churro-like donut was phenomenal  we left more than half of the rest on the plate  quickly made plans to go elsewhere    Lengua taco was cubes of tongue on a dry tortilla  no fixings from what I recall.  El governator left a terrible canned fishy taste in the mouth.  Beet Piccadillo had zero flavor  needed salt      Grilled doblada was like a folded quesadilla with no cheese. This was the best  I guess  but would probably work for a bland pallet.   We didn t complain or anything - but won t be back for the food. I m fine with      prices  so long as the small bites explode with memorable flavor. I can find fancy donuts elsewhere   
Suerte,445,Honestly...it was so good that I almost cried in the middle of my meal. Note that the only time I ve ever actually cried as the result of a good food experience was Alinea in 2016...  I had the suadero tacos  mushroom tlacoyo  and sargento pepper cocktail. Finished every last bite   sip  and I usually never finish my food  Of course  the masa is made in-house and I was tempted to ask for plain tortillas on their own.  Apart from the meal  the staff behind the bar was some of the best I ve encountered. Miles was the main person serving me and I d easily want him to be my server at every other restaurant from here on out.   In total I paid  56 for one person  and I m unemployed right now...but I would still gladly pay twice that amount for the meal I had. As Bourdain once said  It  is frankly a racist assumption that Mexican food...should be cheap. 
Suerte,446,Great food but the happy hour deal isnt as good as it used to be. Tuna is so yummy and same with the beef tacos with guac. Scrum dilly dumcious
Suerte,447,Great service  Delicious Cocktails and amazing food   We ordered a little of everything  Enchiladas verdes  Halibut tostada  suadero tacos  and calabaza tacos  ALL DELICOUS   Now for dessert  we had Tres Leches  With a coffee soak   YUM  
Suerte,448,What a gem  We ordered the grilled sweet papas for an appetizer and the charred greens made this dish pop  We also enjoyed the Suadero Tacos and the roasted cauliflower  Sharing dishes was the greatest  Pete walked us thru quite a journey of flavors  Amazing  
Suerte,449,As my husband and I were enjoying our meal at Suerte this week  which was nicely coursed out so we could really enjoy and relax  I kept exclaiming  Man  We re eating so WELL    Not a remarkable quote  but it s so evident how thoughtfully our meal was prepared. We loved the crunch and flavor of the fresh  handmade tostadas  which also went by other names that I m forgetting . That green chorizo was something I wanted to eat all night..The  chicken mole was so tender and juicy- I just wanted more mole sauce  The churros were slightly underdone but still really yummy  as was the coconut dessert cocktail- not too sweet at all.  The crowd was pretty fancy-schmancy compared to some  but that shouldn t deter anyone from visiting and having a really delicious  memorable meal.  If we ever return to Austin  we ll definitely be back 
Suerte,450,Incredible food  service  experience  drinks.. Go between 5-6 for appetizervsndcdrink specials Dave was our server he was exceptional
Suerte,451,The best horchata I ve ever had. And the mango cocktail that has egg whites...so yum   The food was pretty good  we dined here pretty late so they were out of some of their more popular dishes which only left us without one thing we were going to order. Despite it being almost the end of the night  our waitress visibly tired was still pleasant and gave good recommendations for food. I would definitely dine here again  I liked the ambiance  but could probably come back for the horchata alone.
Suerte,452,The food did have some interesting flavors but nothing truly wowed us.  Neither of us were a fan of the beets veggie dish  they totally missed the mark and the flavors didn t go together  we had to stop eating it after having a bite.  Service wasn t good either.
Suerte,453,Tradition and modernity meet tastefully at this unique Mexican-inspired restaurant.  With a chill vibe  inventive menu  and excellent service  Suerte is one of my favorite Austin restaurants.  I ve eaten here several times now for brunch and dinner.  The restaurant is classy casual  with a vegetarian-friendly menu.  Dishes change based on what is in season. The pastries are delicious  my favorite is usually the concha .  Their ceviches are light  zesty  and complex. Their tacos are small but flavorful.  My brunch go-to is the tamale du jour.   Unlike at most newer Austin restaurants  the servers here are well-informed  helpful  and friendly.  The prices are also reasonable given the quality and creativity of the dishes  not charging outrageous prices for boring  modern American  food  just because they can .  Most importantly  the atmosphere is inviting and unpretentious.  Gives me hope that not all is lost in the hostile takeover of Austin culture.   This is a great place to bring out of towners   Highly recommend.
Suerte,454,For my introductory meal to Austin  my colleague took me to Suerte for dinner.  I was impressed.  The quality of the food and service were quite good.  We ordered the chicken roulade  squash tamal and suadero tacos to share.  Of the three  the suadero tacos  which consisted of crispy brisket and avocado salsa on handmade corn tortillas  was the best dish and absolutely delicious.  I cannot recommend this dish enough   The combination of textures and flavors made the dish.  The chicken roulade had a really good mole sauce.  Thank goodness the dish came with plenty of tortillas  you re welcome to ask for more  to eat with that sauce.  The quality of the ingredients was very apparent in the dishes we tried.  The chicken dish took awhile to arrive  although the time had gone unnoticed by us.  The waiter apologized for the delay and offered a dessert on the house to compensate.  We thanked him for the offer  thought it was very generous  but declined.  Service was top notch.  I have no complaints about it at all.  Our server was friendly  warm and efficient.  The valet for parking was friendly and polite as well.  The restaurant is spacious with the standard level of noise.  The decor is a bit funky  which matched the style of the food.  Suerte is a fun place with great food.  On my next trip to Austin I would love to stop by here again to try other items on their food and drink menu.
Suerte,455,The food was good and fairly unique compared to most traditional restaurants. Staff was friendly and efficient. The plates were a little small and our group felt they fell short on quantity for each plate they brought out for our group. So in other words  for each plate or dish they brought out for our group of diners  they brought at least one portion short and we felt this could have easily been fixed.
Suerte,456,Modern clean  amp  large space for a decent crowd with patio seating as an option too. I like how they have the communal high tops and chef bar seats for walk ins. Very interesting take on Mexican food. Great service amp  presentation of food   Food was overall decent but my personal taste buds do not generally crave for this type of cuisine.
Suerte,457,This is my favorite new restaurant. I want to go back again and again. First  the restaurant is beautiful  bright and comfortable - which  really set the tone. The service was great  our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable. We started with the Smoked Salmon Tostada  which was very good  with very bold flavors. Next  came the Suadero Tacos  which were amazing. The brisket was noteworthy even here in Austin. Next  we had the Bacon and Sweet Potato Tetela  which is now one of my favorite brunch items. Finally  after we were already full but wanted to try one more things  came the Roasted Cauliflower tacos - a wonderful way to end the meal  because this may have been the best thing I ve ever eaten  at least in the top 10  I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will be coming back again and again.
Suerte,458,Thank you The Skinny Confidential for this great recommendation. Creative Mexican Cuisine. Out of the Streets and into a beautiful fine atmosphere. Service  food  cocktails A 
Suerte,459,We had the most MAGICAL dining experience at Suerte the other night thanks to our fantastic server Colby  This guy knows his STUFF. I asked him to give us the menu spiel and he went above and beyond to describe not only the menu but also the values and integrity of the restaurant. I love that he highlighted the dishes that were often overlooked  we went with all of his recommendations and were not disappointed. Holy moly MASA- wow. We even had a ratatouille moment where the masa took my friend back to his abuela s kitchen  making masa and beans. The drinks were unexpectedly delicious- complimenting flavors and nice presentation. Dessert  we had the cascara  was my favorite part and we almost didn t order it  But seriously- to the managers and folks that run this place- this review is really how spectacular of a dining experience we had because our server Colby guided us through. Will be raving about this dinner and restaurant for the rest of time 
Suerte,460,I came to suerte around 9pm on a Saturday night -- it was still packed and for good reason  The servers are extremely knowledgable so be sure to ask them for recommendations.   This is not the place to come if you are craving traditional Mexican  but if you want to try something new it s a great spot. I started with the refried lentils and I am hooked  I got a quesadilla as my main and it was the fanciest  most unique and delicious quesadilla I have ever had. Others had the tacos  broccoli  and the fish and really enjoyed everything.   The cocktails were inventive and tasty and the house margarita was the perfect amount of sweet tart. There is a large list of spirits  and they can make pretty much and drink you request. You can also order a cocktail while waiting to be seated  The menu is a little pricey so be ready for a large bill  but this would be a great spot for a special occasion. Next time I come I would order multiple things are share amongst the table
Suerte,461,Went for the half price mezcal Mondays and learned some valuable things about myself.  1 was that.... just because I like mezcal margs doesn t mean I m ready to sip straight Mezcal. I tried one that tasted like a new boot but like... in a good way  The happy hour only applies to straight mezcal pours-- not any kind of mixed drinks. I m not hard enough to sip this stuff straight but if I WAS this would be awesome.   Wtf this masa is good. Great for gluten free. Get the brisket tacos. Just do it. One of the best things I ve put in my mouth for a while. I m still thinking about the chips. Can t wait to go back 
Suerte,462,Delicious bright flavors thoughtfully executed food.  The pork in the pozole was moist  tender  and smoky.  Real winner  only I wish the bowl was 3x as big    Great attention to detail  cozy decor  and even a couple of non-alcoholic cocktails on the menu.
Suerte,463,i love this place  i went on a nice saturday afternoon and was lucky enough to snag a seat on the patio. it gives you roof top vibes without being too elevated  but privacy from onlookers   i don t like strangers watching me eat  unless they are eating too.. haha    when i went  i wasn t super hungry  so i ordered tostadas.  pats self on back  excellent choice  i had the shrimp tostada which was well balanced   fresh and the pickled carrot tostada.. now  i know what you re thinking--  why the hell would anyone want a pickled carrot on a tostada     with peanuts i might add.   now  when i read this dish on the menu... i knew it could go either terribly bad or terribly good. it went further than my expectations as far as flavor  and that pickled carrot was very balanced. it was a surprisingly delicious dish  needless to say i ordered another one  not that hungry my ass    i also order the whisky cocktail that was perfect    omg.... i almost forgot... i also tried the caramel crossianty dessert. i wish i could have one of those every day with my tea. they are delicate   delicious.
Suerte,464,Not the best food or the best ambiance but the combo of the two works well. Got the chips and salsa and renowned tacos and both lived up to the hype. Not sure what they do to the tortillas but whatever it is makes the experience.
Suerte,465,I don t get it. We were excited to try this because of the reviews  but left disappointed-- their decor makes for a cold  albeit hip  atmosphere. Loved our server and my cocktail  the Don Dario  was delicious. We started with chips con lentils and yogurt  somehow our teeth survived eating this brutally hard chip  which had good flavor but meh  next we tried the carrot tostado  and had sense to ask for a softer tortilla- it was okay but overpriced. The huarache chicken was mediocre and felt like we paid too much for something we could get at a local taco shop and might be better there. The shining star was the grilled squash-- won t be back and not quite sure why Austinites are going crazy for this place-- the food was okay but not for the associated price tag.
Suerte,466,Dined at Suerte last night  and really really wanted to be impressed  but just wasn t.   My chef husband and I don t mind paying a substantial amount for food...that warrants it. Unfortunately  we were really underwhelmed by Suerte mainly for the following reasons.   1. Food  as many have stated  the food is very expensive and small portions. We don t necessarily care about that at all  if the flavors are spot on. That wasn t our case with the 9 dishes we ordered. The best things were probably the peaches  amp  mangoes and the sweet corn appetizer. We also ordered the brisket tacos  and honestly have had better tacos at Tacodeli. The churros were atrocious. Gummy on the inside  the chocolate sauce unappetizing  and no cinnamon whatsoever. But the worst dish was probably the carnitas tamale. The  ber fatty pork belly was very out-of-place with the dish  and nothing gave the dish any texture because everything was very soft and mushy.   2. Service  our server  he never gave us his name  was cold and not personable. He never once asked us what we thought of the food  if we were enjoying our experience or anything. The dishes came out in the wrong order  though this is probably not his fault . He just really didn t seem to care if we liked our visit or were enjoying the food at all.   3. Ambiance  tables are so close together that at one point the neighboring table s servers butt was almost touching my water glass when she was talking to her table. The restaurant also gets SO LOUD you can t hear the person sitting directly in front of you.   Overall  we can t quite figure out why Suerte has blown everyone away  because it did not do that for us. Probably won t return.
Suerte,467,Hands down the best meal that I ve had in a long time  period. If you love Barley and Swine and Odd Duck  this is a must. Personally I loved it more and found it a better value. I m not sure what the previous reviewers were complaining about - we sat at the bar and the bartenders were super attentive  knowledgeable  and friendly.  I look forward to coming back to Austin to eat here again.   Maybe I ll come back and describe the individual dishes when not comatose from gluttony.  Drinks were unique and phenomenal. Get the Rosalinda.
Suerte,468,Good food. Interesting flavors. Had chorizo  lentil with chips and carne asada. Also had house margarita. To be concise  great food. But for level of quality taste in correlation with price. Too expensive.
Suerte,469,I ve been here twice now and I m still blown away so I know that the hype is real. This place is that good.   I took my parents here on a Sunday night and didn t wait at all. Our waitress was so kind and aware of my food allergies and she was very diligent in making sure the kitchen could accommodate me. She even answered our random questions about where the light fixture came from and she seemed to know about every detail of the restaurant. It was very impressive.   And the food  I mean come on. It s unbelievable. We ordered tapas-style and shared everything. Every dish was better than the next. We got the chips con refried lentils  amp  yogurt  sweet corn esquites  squash tamal  quesadilla con tinga de jamaica  suadero tacos  mushroom frito  and carne asada between the four of us.   Every dish was a hit. Not a single one disappointed us. Not a morsel was left on any plate. But if you asked me what you have to get  I d say the chips con refried lentils  quesadilla  and suadero tacos. I wish I had those in my life every day.   Drinks are great too  I love the Paloma. I m not usually a sangria fan  but theirs tasted fresh and not too sugary sweet. They have a full bar so my parents went with martinis that they said were great.   If you go here prepare to spend a lot of money. You won t walk out disappointed that you splurged because it s such a great experience. Awesome date spot. I sat at the bar for dinner my first time and still enjoyed it so if you don t have to wait to sit at the bar  go for it 
Suerte,470,Literally waited 2 hours when they said no longer than 1 hour. No one apologized. We went to the bar to gets drinks and  appetizers  that were apparently shareable. I guess a 15 dollar appetizer is made for a 30 lb female because it was gross and a small portion size. Work on your hostess work and your portion size.
Suerte,471,Suerte had excellent food  especially the Tamal El Mole Blanco  which was sweet  spicy  soft and crunchy all in one dish.  Really a marvel of different tastes.  But what sets Suerte apart was their customer service.  They noticed a branch that was interfering with our outdoor patio dining experience and came out and trimmed it for us.  So if you like food and foliage that is pretty but won t be in your face while eating food  eat here.
Suerte,472,A fancy casual dining establishment that offers exciting visions of haute cuisine wondering the southwest desert.   The crab is fresh and full of flavor  while still having this light and refreshing feel. The almonds provided little nuggets of dense crunch. The celery aioli was just the right amount of creamy that never felt overwhelming. The spicy sharp freshness of the celery was a beautiful idea. The fermented Chile rojo was like a beast on a leash. It attacked the forefront every now and then  but minded itself once everything came together. The tostada was a lovely  coarse crunch that made it feel like a crab was shuffling on top of a rock on the beach shore.  The governator taquitos were not fried to a traditional crisp. Rather they were like mini fried tacos. The shrimp almost had a chicken like texture  and even taste with everything . By itself it did taste like a mild shrimp. The cheese was lovely in its stringy  salty gooiness. The tortilla did add some pepper taste  although it wasn t pronounced. The salsa on the side added some acidic zest.  The lamb barbacoa was not really what I expected  but it was still a delight to eat. I love the portion size for this  even if it s a bit pricy. By no means should you think you re getting a family size portion. The amount of meat they serve fits within the confines of a banana leaf. The meat was primarily lean  yet still moist. I would have liked to see more fatty pieces thrown in the mix  but that s my personal preference. The house made tortillas truly elevate this meal from great to amazing. They have the stone ground corn taste I would desire from homemade  yet still have a delicate  consistent texture that holds up. The pickled veggies are a nice touch  but make sure to ration them for every taco. They offer three sauces  with the tarragon salsa being the best flavor. Its definitely a strong flavor  but I think that s why it works. The sesame habanero sounds great on paper  but its too weak to excite the tongue. The spice level is like a watery tabasco. The mint yogurt is kinda in the middle  where its got more flavor than the sesame one  but not enough compared to the tarragon salsa. This one works best for adding moisture and a level of freshness  but that s it. The bacon bean puree is dangerously delicious. I could have eaten a barrel of those beans. Such a rich  meaty  smoky profile that really hits home the use of smoke in this meal.   The blondie was a savory  yet sweet marvel. The squash ice cream definitely had that root vegetable taste  but clean. The corn masa brownie was the true delight of this meal. It was a great mixture of what I would want from a blondie  but still what I would expect from masa. The cajete was not as integrated as I would have wished  but it was present  it created a lovely  complex depth to the very light  sweet profile.  I like the vision of this chef. They made it fancy enough to justify the prices and presentation  but left it super casual. Among the fog of tex-mex and breakfast taco  this places shines as a beacon of Latin inspired cuisine. This place isnt perfect  but its definitely worth a reservation.
Suerte,473,Guaranteed a great Mexican meal in Austin  TX  Lots of plant based dishes to choose from. Loved the Romanesco dish - TLAYCOYO  Casual and comfy atmosphere. Def recommend
Suerte,474,I loved every minute here  Food was delicious.  Waitress was friendly  charming and knowledgeable  We loved her   Appetizers  we had the shrimp lime thing  delicious and refreshing   And the potatoes - fantastic and had a nice kick.   But i think the potatoes were more of a side dish than an appetizer   For dinner  we had the corn  so delicious   and the brisket tacos. The brisket tacos that were out of this world - maybe one of the favorite thing I ve ever eaten   Highly recommend this place 
Suerte,475,Several people had recommend Suerte to me so for a date night  my husband a I finally tried it out    We had a great dinner at the bar with some great recommendations from our bartender. Our favorites were the crab tostada  El Blondie and the tacos we had from the Vit T menu. Drink were awesome as well  The only thing we were sort of disappointed about was the carne asada entree. It was okay but for the price point there just wasn t anything special about it. I wish there was something more to give it a little more depth. We will definitely be back  
Suerte,476,I really loved this place. My favorites were the concha de chocolate  shrimp tostada  and quesadilla de aguacate. Also a shout out to the lengua taco for the more adventurous eater  Super cute decor and chill vibe  I will definitely be coming back next time I m in Austin.
Suerte,477,If I could give it a 4.5 I would just because the prices are a little high for me but 5 stars if you are looking for a nice fancy dinner. The inside is so instagrammable and cute   I have had the refried lentils which don t look like anything special but they were TASTY. The red chorizo molotes were also a good starter - the green sauce it comes with is banging.   I highly recommend the ceviche suerte - it is so fresh but the portion is small so you ll want one to yourself. The quesadilla was also SO good and so unique. The tortilla was crunchy and idk what was even in it but it tasted so good and creamy.  Goat barbacoa is also a must - it was a bit salty but with the pickled veggies and guac it was very good.   Also  you have to get the swizzle drink it was like spicy blueberry WOW. I ll be craving this again asap.
Suerte,478,A must  The cocktails were incredible. Highly recommend the Aguachile appetizer and Cascara for dessert
Suerte,479,It s loud  hipster  and the best place I ate in Austin    We came at happy hour  which was terrific  because we could try multiple small plates for  5 each. One thing was better than the next   The tacos  carne asada  carnitas  molotes...like none you ve had before  Delicious   Drinks are great  but the star is the unusual twist on each dish. I ve travelled throughout Mexico  and this restaurant pulls influence from several.  Writing this now that I m hoping  and my mouth is watering.  Yeah  it s a little pricey  and portions are small except for the  36 carne asada. As I said  happy hour is the way to go.
Suerte,480,Read about this place in a magazine and it was eh  ok but not the best. Server was not about it - maybe cause we walked in late or whatever but she seriously ruined the vibe. Food was 5 10 but def want to come back in 13 months assuming it ll be better after covid.
Suerte,481,Owner reached out and gave a sincere and much appreciated apology  even though one wasn t necessary. I applaud business owners that take the time to read customer feedback and wish more establishments realised that reviews can make or break their business.  Unfortunately some don t care or realise this until it s too late. Suerte knows what s up and strive to keep on top of their game   that s worth an extra star to me.
Suerte,482,Three of us went to their Saturday brunch.  Loved the interior and the little patio.  Service was good.  We shared one of their pan dulce items it was good. The migas had way too much hollandaise sauce on them.  Seemed like mostly sauce. The shrimp tostada was refreshing according to my friend but it was rather small  especially for the price.  The winner was the pork  amp  huevo.  It was really good.
Suerte,483,Food is authentic  delicious and handcrafted. Cocktails and various alcoholic options are impressive. The blue masa tortillas were awesome- made fresh and in-house  Wait staff is knowledgeable and passionate 
Suerte,484,worst wait list experience i ve had in a long time. spent over 2 hours waiting  just to be told they had the wrong phone number. very disappointed that an otherwise good place is ruined by poor service.
Suerte,485,Holy moly - I am reviewing this from my toilet - I m dying.  This is possibly the worst diarrhea I ve ever had in my life.  The food was tasty but good god it s not worth it.  I m really in pain. On Sunday I fast so I know it s not from anything today and it s evident in my stool that it s from Suerte.  Please save yourself because this is sheer agony. Please be careful.
Suerte,486,I wanted to like it  but suerte didn t live up to expectations.  For a Mexican restaurant  if didn t seem like any other place in Texas or Mexico that I ve been to.  They are trying too hard to be different  and the food suffers.  The beet tamale was study  but flavorless.  The brisket tocos  one of their specialties  was also modestly flavored.  No mmmmm moment.  The brisket was crunch from singed blackened beef  very unhealthy- nitrisome ns  and burnt was the predominant flavor.  On the plus side  the Rose Modesto from Mexico was quite nice.  Overhyped.  Over priced.
Suerte,487,We visited Suerte for Brunch this Sunday  which has been recommended to me by several colleagues.  It was my lovely wife and 13 year old daughter who accompanied me.  We all have dined at La Condesa many times over the years and have enjoyed the growth and even explosion of New Mexican Cuisine interpretations such as ATX Cocina and Comedor.    Suerte did NOT disappoint.  One of the Yelp reviewers stated that she nearly cried during her culinary experience.  I must say - I came close to tears after I savored my first bite of the Duck Confit Flautas with Mole.  The Mole was ridiculous   Lick-the-plate deliciousness   The Corn Pudding Tamal was recommended by our server and it definitely delivered   Shrimp Tostada was an honorable mention.  We chowed down several other menu items but these three listed dishes  especially the first two  will resonate in my hedonic region of my brain and certainly bring my back.  Service was decent and parking was easy via complementary Valet.    The decor and layout of the restaurant was modern  airy- lots of large windows facing 6th street.    Cool hip joint - I ll be back.  Oh one thing  it s as expensive as any place  downtown  to prepare you for possible sticker shock.  Part of the expense was related to our DELICIOUS craft cocktails  Bebida Rosada  amp  Craft Sour  in addition to the  totally-hit-the-spot  Mexican Ros  .  TheMexican Ros   Cabernet Sauvignon grapes  was a perfect accompaniment to our Brunch 
Suerte,488,We came for brunch on a Saturday and the restaurant just feels hip and chic with its bright and open layout and lively atmosphere. We sat at a table by the window  which was nice and our server was quick to greet us. The waitress let us know that they were out of multiple things on the menu  including all of the dulces  the sweeter treats  and their duck Confit flautas dish  which we were most looking forward to so this was pretty disappointing.  For the food we did get  both the tostadas were good with the beet one being my favorite  it was refreshing and bright. The salad was very good too  it was one of the larger dishes we got  although when we ordered it the waitress called it out as being very small and that we would need two for the table - that wasn t the case but it was a yummy dish so we weren t mad to have two servings. These were a nice balance to the fried and dacedently creamy rest of the meal. The tacos we got added a nice variety  the vegetarian ones were flat with nice flavors and the snapper one was crunchy and fried. The huevos dish was a bit one note but still good nonetheless  the hollandaise sauce was done well and richly creamy. The red tomato sauce dish was creamy as well and very good. We ordered some mimosas which were your average mimosas but they had some brunch cocktails that looked really good that I want to come back to try   Overa  it was a little frustrating that they were out of so many menu items relatively early in the day  but the food was good and the atmosphere makes you happy to be there 
Suerte,489,We had just arrived in town and was told all about lucky hour at this high end restaurant. Following directions we gave it a shot  we tried every appetizer on menu as well as the tacos of the day  my sister ordered 2 drinks and I ordered 1. We also ordered the peach tres leches cake because we have sweet teeth. Our bill for 3 drinks 6 plates of food and dessert was  56. I highly recommend lucky hour. Such a great experience  
Suerte,490,Had brunch here with some friends.  I got the Migas.  They were good but not outstanding.  Service was pretty good. My coffee took forever to come which was disappointing since I need my caffeine lol.  We also shared 2 desserts and those were good as well.  I ve heard great things about this restaurant so I intend to come back for dinner at some point  hoping to have something really memorable 
Suerte,491,The food was pretty boring they have a couple tacos and only one vegetarian option. SO overpriced for what you get and the plates are lacking. We had to order and pay on our phone and they didn t tell us there was some secret 20  charge of 18  to  pay the kitchen staff during this time  um it s not my job to pay the kitchen staff  were here to pay for the food we ordered and ate so I think this place os Very shady.   Update  I see someone has responded but AGAIN I say  it s not my job to pay extra money to fund you and your staff and your restaurant when I come there. I come to pay for food I order  and tip if I have good service. If you plan on making your customers pay extra charges on top of the already very expensive lack luster food that you re saying is  laid back  idk what s laid back about 4 options of food and crazy prices but go ahead. but at least teach your employees to disclose that so you don t scam anyone else ok      I have never heard of such a charge in my life. I ve heard of a charge If you have a big party of people  but we had 4 people and 4 boring tacos and some waters lol. Didn t constitute an 18  charge
Suerte,492,Another fantastic meal with friends here but this time did brunch   Palomas here are a bit diff but worth the try  Actually one of my faves in the city currently. The sweet breads are made in house and delish   The chilaquiles were on point   Looked like a small portion but perfect in all reality  Thanks again for a solid spot to go when looking to show off Austin
Suerte,493,We came to Suerte for brunch because we had heard a lot of good things about their menu. Looking at their online menu  it looked great   The only disappointment we had was that we were sat and it took about 15 minutes for someone to attend to our table. Unfortunately  we were hangry and a bit more impatient than usual. However  after I called the hostess over to let her know that we had yet to meet the waiter  a very pleasant woman  manager  maybe  Not sure  came over and was very apologetic  knowing that it was our first time to the restaurant and hadn t been attended to. She did promise to make it up to us  and she did   The favors of all the dishes were absolutely on point  and while not adhering to conventional Mexican flavor pairings  it still felt very homey - like comfort food that my Mom would make. The cocktails were also very good.   We absolutely loved the shrimp tostada. The acidity of the marinade with the creaminess of the crema was very well balanced and I wanted MORE.   Overall  super solid place and I am curious to come back to experience the dinner menu.
Suerte,494,This is my new favorite restaurant in Austin. Service  food  ambiance and the drinks are perfectly executed. Start with the ceviche and make your way to the Goat Barbacoa while sipping on a Don Dario.  Can t wait to go back and try the rest of the menu
Suerte,495,I absolutely love this place  The atmosphere is great  the staff is super friendly  and the food is just out of this world good.   Their Luck Hour is where it s at if you re looking to save a few bucks  but you better get there ASAP if you want to take complete advantage of it.   It can be a bit cold on the inside so if you re prone to getting chilly easily you may want to bring a light sweater.  Their chips and salsa  while not traditionally served  is fantastic  Their house made mesa chips are amazingly flavourful and hold their crispness even if you take awhile to devour the dish.   The ceviche... it s great. You should get it if you re a fan of any ceviche. It s a lot less citrusy than most thanks to the cucumber which was surprising.   The award winning Suadero Tacos blew me away. I eat these every night in my dreams. I would request these on my death bed they re that good.  I think what surprised me the most was the Grilled Sweet Papas. Less sweet than you d expect thanks to the spice of the garlic chile black pepper oil and very filling.   Do yourself a favor and check out this east Austin gem 
Suerte,496,Aaron   I appreciate your response and am glad to be heard after we left your establishment. I do want to acknowledge your team s willingness to accommodate our party of ten despite not having a reservation and in conflict with your large party policy. Clearly you did not have to seat us at a table. However  as you know we were willing to go elsewhere but after conversation your team set a place for our group. If your team actually thought that members of our group should not have been served then I would have hoped that you would have politely asked us to leave. If this is the case then I would encourage TABC to audit your establishment for the public safety of our community.   Please be assured that based on my experience at Suerte and this back and forth on Yelp from Suerte s management I will never recommended this restaurant to anyone. In addition  I will contact TABC directly to ensure that the State plans a visit soon.   Original post  Great atmosphere but don t expect to be treated well. We walked in to celebrate a friend s birthday and the wait staff made us feel like second class citizens even though we had a  270 bill. All of our out of town guests felt uncomfortable  tense  and feel like we were not treated well. Oh did I say we came in at 5pm on a Saturday...
Suerte,497,Amazing Food  Service  Atmosphere   And Special Thanks to Iron Cactus-for their Awful Service  that ALLOWED Us to FIND THIS AWESOME RESTAURANT   
Suerte,498,Quality masa made in house   quality tortillas. Suadero tacos  4  are a must although they are slightly too salty. Fantastic black bean tamal with beet cream topped with crispy quinoa. Goat Barbacoa was delicious with the fresh herbs  yoghurt sauce and dollop of bacon beans. Tuna snapper quesadilla also a must. House cocktails are decent. Absolute brilliant ambiance  would come for the setting alone.
Suerte,499,So we finally came to suerte for what was described to us as  life changing tacos .  Wow they were amazing  I will dream about these tacos for the rest of my life. Suerte is very close to whislers and Lazarus if you are familiar with east Austin. Our bartender  Celia hopefully i spelt it right  was awesome and had great recommendations. We started with the nada Paloma - a Paloma made with mezcal and the Mexicano mezcal. If you haven t had much experience with mezcal it has a very Smokey flavor but is great in drinks and alone if you have the right one. Suerte has a huge list of them   We decided to start with the tacos of the day which were shrimp tacos with potatoes  onion  cilantro and avocado on a small corn tortilla. Easily the freshest and best taco I have ever had. We next decided to get the brisket tacos- they come with four. The tacos have an avocado cruda  onions and cilantro as well on corn tortillas. We had three tacos each and we were so full. We got tres leches as well and they even put a candle in it because my boyfriend mentioned it was my birthday. These tacos are seriously life changing so be prepared to be disappointed by every other taco place ever    We will def be back when we come back to Austin   
Suerte,500,Suerte certainly lives up to the hype  we have now been to dinner and brunch  Brunch today was delicious  my favorite was the beet tacos and agua Fresca lemonade. I really like the interior of this restaurant and the bathroom wall paper. To be honest  I don t remember everything we ordered when we had dinner. But everything was very good  Also  good to know- we did not have reservations today for Sunday brunch but were able to be seated right away as a table of 4. Will definitely be back 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,1,I love Cabo Bobs  I wish they would come up to Plano  but I used to go to Cabo Bob s in various locations around Austin 5 days a week for multiple years and my visits back to Austin are not the same without a burrito with a fresh pressed tortilla. I found this place probably close to a decade ago  Has time gone by that quickly  I have had countless events catered by Cabo personally and privately and it is always a hit  Even with all of those visits and probably a years salary minimum spent here  my enthusiasm has not wavered in the slightest and it s still one of my favorite places on earth. If I could have food from only one restaurant for the rest of my life  it would be Bobs.   This location has plenty of parking and has a tendency to get quite a line  but they move relatively quickly. In either case  it is worth it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,2,This place is always packed  service is quick but the lines are too still too long. The tacos are available with different tortilla flavors and myriad toppings to choose from  make each one unique to taste. Chips and queso is just okay.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,3,I m not a particularly big fan of the build-your-own concept in general. I m no expert  I want  you  to tell me the best combination of ingredients. But I wanted to try their tacos and build-your-own is the only vegetarian option.  It s fun that they offer five different varieties of in-house tortillas but the Smoky Cheddar that I chose had no structural integrity whatsoever. All three of my tacos fell apart immediately upon picking them up.  I hate zucchini on tacos so I skipped the grilled veggies blend and went straight for the Baja Beans  THANK YOU for having three bean options ... all of which are vegetarian -- black  pinto  or baja   saut ed poblanos and onions  cheese  and fresh cilantro. I upgraded for some extra guacamole and queso.  The flavors didn t meld well. Everything was okay but not great. Perhaps they have wonderful burritos but I wouldn t recommend going for tacos. There are far better places in Austin.    Ranked as  112 on my taco list of 144 locations AustinTacoMojo.com 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,4,I am SO happy right now. The only thing wrong with this place is it s not located in South Florida   REAL authentic tortilla chips. So many choices of Taco or Burritto shells the corn taco is so good it puts all other corn tacos to shame  Like the Smoky Cheddar shells too. The fried fish is amazing especially with poblano pepper onions  rice beans  cilantro and Pico de gallo. Also shredded pork so good.  The line is out the door during lunch but so worth it   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,5,As usual cabo bobs never disappoints. Super huge portions and bomb toppings. The star is always their tortillas. Its been years since I ve been back in Austin and like everything else  prices have gone up but the portions and quality has remained the same  Will be back the next time I m in Austin.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,6,Don t bother coming into this location  you will wait forever while they prepare the to-go orders ahead of you. Order to-go or go to one of the better managed locations.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,7,Cabo Bob s has been on my radar since undergrad  sooo  not to date myself but 10  years now  . They stand out to me because they re Chipotle-style - in terms of serving - BUT they press and make fresh flour tortillas in front of you to start your order    The tortilla doughs are made from scratch  amp  there are 4 different flavors   Buttermilk  Ancho Chili  Cilantro Tomatillo  Smoky Cheddar. If you get a full-size burrito - pro-tip  you can mix 2 different doughs    I went for the Bob s Special Deluxe Fish Tacos  Cilantro tomatillo  ancho chili  amp  buttermilk tortillas  crispy fish  Chipotle Crema  Mango Pico  guacamole  cheese  shredded cabbage  -- pretty damn good fish tacos. The fish was crispy and tasty. I didn t think I would like guac and cheese and crema but I was wrong  all the flavors paired really nicely together. I could taste the subtleties from the different doughs.   We stopped at this specific location on the way to the airport  but Cabo Bob s has locations all over ATX 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,8,I stopped by Cabo Bob s Burritos while visiting Austin because of recommendations from friends. The food did not meet my expectations. You start off picking a tortilla  they come in unique different flavors. Another thing I did like was that the tortilla was pressed right when you made a selection. Then  you choose your meats  toppings  and sauces. The meats were standard although there was some choices I have never seen at other burrito places  fish and brisket . The toppings were basic and they have many different options for sauces.   The burrito was extremely bland and stuffed with mostly rice so thats all you can taste. The meat quality was very poor. I could barely taste the ancho ranch that I asked for in my burrito. I got two burritos with the same fillings but they were very disproportionate for the same price. The queso was poor quality and it tasted equivalent to the nacho cheese you get from the gas station. The tortilla chips on the other hand were thick and crispy and probably the best part of the meal.  The line was very long and it wrapped around the restaurant to the door. I waited 30 minutes to order my burrito. The inside of the restaurant was not very clean. The tables were dirty along with the bathroom which was too gross for me to use. Even though there was a lot of people waiting in line  there was plenty of seating in the restaurant. The ambiance is very nice and relaxed.   Cabo Bob s lacks flavor even when you use their sauces. Overall  the quality of the ingredients are decent minus the meat.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,9,We ordered the Deluxe Fish Tacos and the Best Steak Burrito  with smoky cheddar tortilla  off the specials menu. Both were very good  I loved the flavors of the fish tacos with the mango pico. I also added some of their 66 Red hot sauce which was spicy but delicious  Next time I think we would build our own because I would prefer corn tortillas and my husband wanted extra meat in his burrito. We will definitely be returning though 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,10,Delicious  yummy  and sooo satisfying. Better than Chipotle  My friend had this catered for her wedding and it was loved. The tortillas in particular are so good.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,11,Went for lunch and it was very busy. Chose to do mobile ordering assuming orders would be taken in order  but they gave a return time instead. It would have been quicker to wait in line and order. The staff will not rush our order even if it is slow. Lesson learned. The food was good and the portions were big.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,12,Honestly food was really bland. Saut ed onions were raw. Everything was ice cold think cold chipotle on steroids. No flavor. And the staff was super rude. I went to go pick up and recognized my order. I said awesome that s me right there she looked at me and said name I told her my name and she said yeah this isn t yours rudely. I kept trying to get her attention and she finally turned back while hiding the receipt and asked me for the last name as if I was trying to steal their unseasoned cold burritos. When I said the name she didn t even apologize or anything just rudely handed me the bag. Won t go back. And don t recommend it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,13,This summer like many of you I want to try out new-to me spots and support more Austin businesses in this stage of the pandemic.   In late June  I decided to try Cabo Bob s in South Austin for the first time  and it was a great dinner.   As a pescatarian  usually at burrito places  I have the vegetarian option because they lack a fish or shrimp option. Enter Cabo Bob s  which has a tasty fried fish option.   One of the coolest things is that they have fresh raw tortilla dough prepared  so when you order  they make your taco or burrito tortillas on the spot on a giant grill. The tortillas taste amazing too with multiple flavors.    My partner had the fish burrito  which was delicious on a cilantro tomatillo tortilla. I tried the fish tacos  which were also fresh and yummy with mango salsa.   My areas to improve would be the queso was cold  but the staff gave us a warm one upon request   and the flavors of the beans and veggies are all a bit bland. One thing that would be great for vegetarian and vegan options is for the saut ed veggies to be more flame grilled instead  this would amp up the veggie flavors too.   The outdoor patio was so great to enjoy eating out safely  and the sweet mint iced tea was literally the best tea I have had in years. I would come back here just to enjoy more tea  I saw a person carrying out a large gallon of it  and I was like  Yep  that makes sense    Cabo Bob s is a great  affordable option  and I have already been back again since my first visit. Lunch was even better than dinner. Add this spot to your list 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,14,When I discovered Cabo Bob s had fish tacos and fish burritos along with the other usual tortilla fillings and extras I made it a point to check it out. I really miss the Baja Fish Tacos and Burritos that I loved while living in San Diego and although there are several restaurants in the Austin area that offer fine fish tacos they just weren t doing  it  for me.   So it was with real anticipation I got in line and watched the counter folk assemble the orders ahead of me while listening to the customer s preferences. The different flavored flour tortillas are huge and they fill them up with your choice of protein along with varieties of beans  rice  cheese and assorted veggies and sauces to you get it just the way you want it. Nice.  I ordered my Fish Burrito with a few substitutions - brown rice instead of white  Baja beans instead of black  and a serious  walk thru the garden  that made for a bodacious bountiful and tasty crispy fish burrito. It s the closest thing to the ones I left back in SoCal and it was tasty and filling.   One caveat - the fish really needs more seasoning. I ve had several of these now and while the whole burrito is a thing of beauty  the fish itself is kinda bland. They also used far less crema in the mix than I preferred so I had to ask for more which they added with a smile but I was surprised at how little they routinely provide.  On one visit I had the Baja Fish Tacos instead. They were very tasty and also came very close to the ones I remembered and you get three tacos per order for the same price as the burrito. I found the burritos more filling but both were quite tasty. Their other fillings were more popular with the line of customers ahead of me and all looked and smelled delicious but the Fishy ones are the ones I crave the most. Vaya con Pescados 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,15,Amazing food every time  Get the fish when its fresh and you won t be disappointed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,16,First stop after flying in to AUS and it did not disappoint  Delicious fish tacos     Topping them with 66 Red Sauce was perfection for me.  Chips and queso were good too. Clean dining area  quick service  and portions were generous. We originally declined the punch card   just visiting   but we left with one  We ll be back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,17,Very poor service  Has the option to order online and or call the restaurant. When I went to order online a message pops up and says not taking orders at this time. Tried calling the restaurant to see if I could place the order  amp  the lady said yes. So I said I d call back when my order was complete. Went through the process of getting everyone s order  called back TWICE then no one answered the phone. Ridiculous 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,18,My husband is torn between Chipotle and Cabo Bob s - and that s a really good sign. It was a large burrito  with plenty of protein  we added extra   and delicious for a night out.   Tip  order ahead on their website - the lines can get long otherwise.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,19,For those that haven t been  consider it similar to Chipotle but A HECK OF A LOT BETTER with fresh ingredients   One of my favorite places for a quick bite to eat 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,20,Really cool atmosphere with a nice outdoor seating area. Lots of options for endless possibilities from tacos  bowls  and burritos. Friendly staff and delicious food.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,21,My favorite place in Austin for 5 years straight  Eric one of the managers is so wonderful and kind  big fan of his. Love all the people and homemade tortillas and fresh ingredients  you can t go wrong here
Cabo Bob's Burritos,22,This location is always clean and fast. You get your food in a few minutes  Food always tastes freshly cooked and  great  better than chipotle in my opinion  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,23,Didn t know what to expect but I was satisfied. At first site of all the different toppings Is overwhelming but you can t go wrong here. The food is good. I like the different tortilla options you can choose from it just takes burritos to another level.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,24,I frequent this spot  probably once a month.  Always great service.  My visit today may have been the best ever.  I usually get mine to go  as I did as well today.  The line wasn t long at all  and the employees were on point.  I probably was in there no longer than 3 minutes while ordering 3 burritos.  Speedy and quality service   This is how it should be done and can be an example to a lot of establishments.  I will continue to give them my business.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,25,I mean what is there not to love about Cabo s  Except I wish they had different sizes for tortilla options like free birds does  Other than that 10 10 would recommend  P.s. try the pork very tender and juicy  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,26,We are on our first trip to Austin coming from one state park to the other. We got hungry and as last minute decided to come into this place. These fish tacos are certainly different than your standard beer battered fish tacos  however the flavor between the pico tortillas and fish with their salsa is mind blowing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone out here visiting that really makes fish tacos. Variety of tortillas is also a great addition especially cilantro tomatillo.  Thank you Bob   -David-
Cabo Bob's Burritos,27,Been here multiple times  It s an upgraded version of Chipotle. So many toppings to pick from. They have different tortilla flavors too and make the tortillas fresh depending on what flavor you choose. I usually get the burrito or the bowl with chicken. Portion sizes are huge. Paying extra for the queso as a topping is so worth it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,28,If you re looking for a good burrito... look no further. At Cabo Bob s you can can choose between 4 different tortilla flavors for either tacos or a burrito. They make the tortilla fresh in front if you  very cool to see. I got the ancho chile tortilla  it was a nice addition of spice. My boyfriend got the buttermilk flour one  he enjoyed it. I got a steak burrito and the steak was nicely seasoned and you get a good amount. You can choose from brisket  steak  chicken  grilled veggies or crispy fish. They have a bunch of toppings. Everything looked very fresh. I got chips and queso. The chips are VERY fresh and crunchy   I m usually a die hard chipotle girl but after going here... things have changed 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,29,We typically order Cabo Bob s just for dinner for two adults  but wanted to try out their catering for a Kentucky Derby party and we were not disappointed. Our order consisted of beef  pork  and veggie tacos complete with every side--beans  corn  multiple salsas  veggies  and more. We even got corn and flour tortillas and endless nachos to keep our guests fed  with options  and happy.  The food just needed to be heated up upon picking up and setting it out  and Cabo Bob s provided all the containers and utensils. The food also tasted just as good later on in the night when we were going for another round.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,30,Food wasn t what I expected. They seemed to rush me. I have bad anxiety  so I picked right away because of the long line. I wish I would ve pick something else besides burrito.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,31,Amazing burritos  quality ingredients  and one of my favorite spots to frequent. Love Cabo bobs and all of their options 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,32,Decently priced. Not better than Fuego but still a good burrito taco stop. We did the create your own bowl and burrito. They give generous portions but the meat can be seasoned a little better. The tortillas are fresh and made when you order. Also  the staff is helpful and friendly. Overall  good experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,33,Great    Loved it never been there before  Quesadilla with extra beef faijta sooo good   Recommend 100 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,34,Cabos has the most amazing burritos  tacos and queso in ATX hands down. Their brisket and fish tacos are TO DIE for and their chips and queso are a must add in every order    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,35,I ve been a fan of Cabo Bob s for quite some time. Recently there has been a new guy working the rice and protein section who is SO STINGY with the rice and meats. I asked for double meat and I got 1 4 of an extra serving but was charged at the register for double. This male employee hold up the entire line making the  normally quick process  quite long. And on top of alllll of that nonsense the cashier woman was extremely rude  I gave her my punch card and she let out an annoyed sigh... then I asked for a new one and she threw down the hole puncher after aggressively punching the card.   Y all need to get your act together or I will take myself to chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,36,Ever since living in San Diego for 10 years prior to moving out to Austin  I ve been in search of California style burritos Mexican food and this place does not disappoint in the slightest  I ve been here 3 times so far and the level of customization on their burritos is sooo gooddd. Think chipotle but actually authentic and much more elevated  Last time I got the cilantro lime fresh pressed tortilla with grilled steak and all the fixings  Pro Tip  ask for a mixed tortilla  they have 4 flavors and you can even customize your tortilla profile e.g.  ancho chili with cilantro lime or smokey cheddar with buttermilk flour . They have an outdoor patio for eating during these COVID times which I really appreciate. I ve also had their crispy fish tacos in the past and they were incredible   You ve gotta try their queso  such cheesy goodness. 10 10 would recommend you check this place out 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,37,The Smokey cheddar tortilla is fabulous. The chicken has so much flavor but isn t spicy. Great find in the southern Austin area  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,38,Found a spot on yelp that had 800 plus reviews and 4.5 stars. That s hard to get without being awesome. It was awesome  We each ate a burrito bigger than Ruth Porter Gilmore s face. The line at 8 pm almost stretched out the door. I had an ancho Chile tortilla hand pressed and cooked in front of me. Ruth has cilantro tomatillo tortilla. I had Baja beans  squash  brisket  guacamole  cheese  onions  sour cream and lime juice. Ruth had steak  Baja beans  onions  cheese  lettuce  green salsa and colantro. There were happy faces all around. No wonder people gush. The bill was 20  with drinks. The only way this gets cooler is if they raise Anthony Bourdain from the dead and he joins us for dinner. It might be cooler if it were a taco truck  but alas the ingredients in my burrito alone would have broken the axle. I d go here if I were u before I died. I need to come back just so I can try a different tortilla or 2. BTW every 8th burrito is free with a punch card. It s good I don t live in Austin. This is living well.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,39,Get the Fish Tacos and thank me later  The chipotle crema and mango pico add so much flavor to the tacos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,40,I live a Ketogenic Lifestyle  looked through the menu and made a bowl that sounded amazing.  I paid for double protein - no way I got a double portion. That s really my only complaint. The rest of what I ordered was good  it was well sauced and had decent flavor. I did curbside pickup - no fork or napkins in the bag was annoying. Not enough to eat for the price I paid.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,41,Great tacos  Classics are great  just fish tacos are my go to   or make your own. Tortillas are fresh - you can even mix flavors for a burrito. Skip the salads - I had one and it was pretty meh - shredded iceberg as a base so pretty lack luster.  Also. Make sure if you order online you are selecting the correct store - it s so easy to mix up Anderson LANE with Anderson MILL. They re great and will fix it. But you ll have to wait...not that I ve done this before....
Cabo Bob's Burritos,42,I like Cabo Bob s and have had it a few times  but I  recently ordered ahead of time online for a larger order. My husband went to pick it up  and no one had a clue about the order. I called them and the girls said she could have it ready on Monday  It was Wednesday. Then she said she could not refund until Monday. I did not want a refund  I just wanted the food. So I asked if I could just read my order off and she entered it-like why was that not an option to begin with. The original order must have magically surfaced because magically it was ready. My other issue was we ordered fish nachos  and guess what  There was no fish. So...not sure if this is the location we will go to again. It was a bit of a hot mess.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,43,Chipotle on steroids- enough said.   Food  5 5 Ambiance  4 Bang for the buck  10 5  I had heard about this location from someone out of town and it is definitely worth the reviews and price. FYI if you get a burrito you will leave full for the next couple of days.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,44,Food is good  pretty large portions  still have yet to finish a bowl or burrito in one sitting .   Tortillas are fresh  ingredients are all pretty fresh. Nothing to write home about  but would go back if in the area and the chick-fil-a line is too long. Prepare to wait for a pretty minute  line can get pretty long.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,45,First time visiting the Ben white location and omg everything was great    Rick  store manager  was awesome  Making sure everything was running smoothly with his crew and customers  Ramiro  manager  was helping out in the line and working together with the staff while also keeping up with Managent duty  All staff looked great   Working hard and keeping great service at all times  Definitely going back and totally recommend if you are in the area   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,46,Ok.OK.. I ll give a three as their salsa was great.  The green one IS spicy and great.  Got their pork burrito..first time.  What is it with San Antonio and NOT cooking their rice.  It shouldn t be crunchy.Crunchy.. had to tear burrito apart to get to meat and items as it wasn t entitle. Handmade Tortilla cooked right there is pretty good.  Just wish I could actually eat what I ordered. It was mostly rice.. and that wasnt ettible.. beans were cooked well and flavorful.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,47,Like Chipotle but better. Nice people too. Try the fish tacos  they re awesome. Nice find
Cabo Bob's Burritos,48,Melissa and Alex are great good hearted managers of the 2 locations I m familiar with. If you have 30 bucks you can buy 5-6 kid burritos so don t be afraid of the price. Everyone in Austin knows bout this place and loves it. They are very very clean having good plastic glass screens to protect the food. They serve with gloves. There is 3 locations 500 Ben White by Walmart is a great location you can grab gas and groceries there before so they flavor there tortillas Smokey cheddar  orange  butter milk  white    ancho  red  cilantro green. They have a ocean surfer theme it s so cool .
Cabo Bob's Burritos,49,To keep my review concise  so you get all the info you need quickly  I have created standard headers with info I hope you find helpful in making a quick and knowledgable decision about your dining choice   -Cuisine Type  Casual Mexican  -Food Review  You order at counter and follow the assembly line process as they build your order.  I tried the fish tacos and I was NOT HAPPY   They were small and very disappointing.  The fish must have been fried much earlier because any crunch and contrast in texture was non-existent.  Def not worth the calories as I was considering this a splurge in my otherwise clean eating.  My daughter ordered a burrito.  Dont remember it much except it as on the smoked cheddar tortilla.  We were both excited to try this but honestly  I dont know what the positive comments are on this because any smoke cheddar flavor was very mild and not worth even mentioning. I have a strong sense of taste and it was negligible so that being said  I would not factor that into any reason to go.  Overall  I didnt enjoy although my hopes were high because the place looked fun and like it might have been a great alternative to Chipolte.  Actually  I prefer Chipolte overwhelmingly to this and I really wish I could say differently.    -Service  Efficiently moved through line.  -Ambience  Sat outside and was super casual and fine.  -Parking  Plenty in strip shopping center  -Price and Value   Not great for what I ordered.  If tasted good I guess it would be a great value.  -Overall Comments   I see no reason to go back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,50,We ve had Cabo Bob s on our radar since they were  a single location  now there are 3 and deservedly so.  They are similar to Chipotle s but so much better.  Wifey loved her chicken bowl with lots of veggies and I snarfed a beef and queso burrito that also had loads of tasty goodies  didn t think I could finish it all but things that taste this good have a habit of disappearing.  This will not be our last visit....and soon 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,51,Overdue review here   So I loved taking out of town family friends to eat here because their food is delicious and they have their own flavor if you re comparing them to other popular burrito places. What makes Cabo Bob s stand out is their freshly pressed tortillas and options of tortilla flavors  Buttermilk flour  Ancho Chile  red   Cilantro Tomatillo  Green   and Smokey Cheddar  Orange .  They have Chicken  Fish  you ve gotta try it  veggie  no meat   pork  brisket  and steak burritos.  I also recommend their nachos. Yum. Load them with all the goods. Or try their chips and queso. The freshly made chips are great.   Now onto Covid precautions. We were glad they offered online ordering  and curbside pickup. You just pull up to the curbside sign  by the door on the side with the outdoor seating  and they bring your order to you. It s perfect  and staff were wearing masks. We ve been a couple of times and I continue to recommend it.  Our brother in law loved it  and to our surprise they opened a Cabo Bob s in San Antonio by his work. So he got to continue enjoying it after first trying this Cabo Bob s location.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,52,This is like a chipotle but so much better. The line is long but worth it.   I ordered the  1 fish tacos and had it on 3 different tortillas. Surprisedly  the server accidentally put guacamole in it but I didn t mind  It was actually really good with it. Ordering is pretty simple and they are quick to finish orders.   The fish tacos is the most popular and  glad I was able to try it  There is a hot sauce stand but it actually wasn t that good. Had a lingering smell of vinegar.   The experience was good and it was good portions  I could only finish 2 out of the 3 tacos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,53,These are  were   the best burritos in town but their quality control has been getting worse with each visit. This is my 3rd or 4th straight curbside order that has been wrong. They forgot all vegetables and sauces in my burrito and excluded everything I asked for on the side as well.  The receipt taped to my bag clearly shows what I asked for on the side.  To top it all off  their online ordering portal is one of the worst I ve seen. This is the last time I order curbside at Cabo Bob s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,54,Cabo Bob s serves up consistently fresh fish tacos  amp  burritos at reasonable prices. I usually go with the Deluxe Fish Tacos  and my husband opts to build a burrito. It s fun to try the different tortilla flavors  and the food really hits the spot. Highly recommend ordering ahead online to avoid waiting in line.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,55,If you are looking for a quick easy dinner this is your spot. You will never want to visit chipotle again  They offer sooo many options and the possibilities are endless.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,56,The tortillas make the whole burrito. It s SO good and much better than the other chains with the same concept. I wish I had more time to eat it again before I leave town 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,57,One of my favorite spots in town. I love Cabo bobs. They make amazing make your own burritos and make the tortillas from scratch right in front of you  I always order the cilantro tomatillo burrito and go with the fried fish. Queso is extra but it goes really well with the fried fish . It s a lot of food for the price and if they have a punch card that if you buy 6 meals you can get a free one the next time you order food 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,58,Probably the best fish burrito I have had in Austin. It definitely tasted like it is from scratch.  First time trying their location and it will not be the last.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,59,How  Why  Who  What   Is what I found myself asking just a few bites into my massive ly disappointing  burrito. How and why is this rated so high  Who eats this  And what is good about this place  Not sure what s worse the steak or chicken  Chicken was a pretty poor attempt of BBQ  wasn t expecting anything near Valentina s but this still fell way short of my low expectations  and the steak had zero flavor  a consistent theme . White rice flavorless  black beans eh  guacamole don t bother  and the salsa probably worse then all the above. Go enjoy a taco elsewhere. If you re thinking and craving a burrito please read this review and find another place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,60,Chipotle on steroids   The menu is bigger...  fish tacos  different flavor tortillas  multiple been options  etc  much more options... and in my opinion for what I had every bit as good if not better   I had a bowl... steak  with brown rice  black beans  sour cream  queso  and mango salsa. Man it was loaded and good   The mango salsa was a perfect compliment to the steak    One thing for sure the queso is 200x better then Chipotle    The design is the same assembly line like food prep. However the eating area is more upscale... more styled.  The chips are made right there and fresh. The staff are fast and helpful. Overall the experience was great.  Be sure to try the hot hot sauce... it is excellent  Not just flaming hot... but flaming hot with flavor... truly delicious.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,61,I have been coming here for 3 years now and I think it s time I speak up about my experience as it is long overdue. The food is delicious  The food alone is 5 stars  My family and I come 1-2 times a week because we love it so much. However  their employees and different managers they ve had are always extremely rude. My mom  sister  and I are all petite 5 0 -5 2  women  so the regular sized burrito is enormous for us  especially myself since I have the gastric sleeve surgery. We always order the mini burrito and respect the 3 topping rule as well as order an adult sized drink even though it comes with a drink already. Every time we come  the employees repeatedly tell us  only 3 toppings  over and over again. The last time I was here  the manager was counting down each topping  saying  2-1 more sides  and went as far as telling me  I m just making sure   when I told her I knew how to count and was aware of how many I had left. Today I was told sauces are also considered a  topping  and given attitude as well as an eye roll when I told her we ve always been able to add sauces after our 3 toppings. After being practically shamed for ordering the mini burrito the first couple of times  we called and asked to speak to the manager in hopes of getting some clarity. This was in about 2020 and the manager said there is no age requirement or rules in place about adults not being able to order the mini burrito. With the amount of dirty looks and attitude we get from employees every time we order these  we ve started to wonder if maybe they pay for the ingredients or are on a commission based salary because it truly seems like it s personally affecting them every time. I understand it s extremely busy and some employees may be tired  but their attitudes are horrible every single time. It is extremely unpleasant to be treated like a criminal for ordering a smaller burrito due to my portion preferences. To be very honest  this could be seen as a form of discrimination. I hope this reaches the staff as I would love to continue coming even more than 1-2 times a week and not be upset disappointed after every time.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,62,This is my new favorite spot if Austin  Was driving through Austin on a Saturday night and did a search for the best fish tacos in Austin and this place was on the list. These fish tacos did not disappoint  They were huge and full of flavor at a really good price  The staff was super friendly and let me try a few of the many tortilla flavors they have.  Now they just need to open up a restaurant in Houston 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,63,Bottom line  run  do not walk to come here. Frickin  amazing   One of the best burritos I ve ever had in my life -- and I live in Los Angeles. Renowned food critic  Jonathon gold must MUST  Visit this place. Arguably better than La azteca tortilla in east La.   Very flavorful  their homemade smoked cheddar tortillas are omg scrumptious  and wholly original and deserve to be shared to more than the confounds of Los Angeles.  Get the smoked cheddar burritos you won t regret it.  Steak and queso burrito with everything please. Big fat and juicy burrito. If calories kinda weren t a thing  I d choose this anytime.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,64,This place is subway meets chipotle  Their house made salsas are always delicious  the four options of tortillas are spun and cooked right in front of you   You could never go wrong with any of your options. Yummy  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,65,Get the fish tacos  So good - you can never go wrong here. There are so many options and the staff is willing to mix it up and give their recommendations  as well.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,66,Ordered with Door Dash. Burrito tortilla was burnt. I didn t receive my queso  salsa  or sour cream that I ordered. Very disappointed....  Replying to owner manager comment   you do have Door Dash. I literally just ordered from you.  I have included a photo screenshot of your restaurant on the Door Dash App. I ordered your Brisket and Queso Burrito. Explain that please...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,67,Great experience   This place reminded me a lot of chipotle and freebirds but with a more lively atmosphere . I ordered a super steak burrito and it was huge   way to big to finish Alone.  the prices are similar to other food places with similar walk down and pick your toppings style .  If you want to try a slightly cooler chipotle this is your place
Cabo Bob's Burritos,68,Was recommended shortly after w moved to Austin and we have been back a few times already  Whoever wrote chipotle on steroids didn t miss.   My husband got the burrito and the portion was huge. And everything about it was delicious - the steak was juicy and flavorful and he was able to mix his burrito flavors which is awesome  I got the crispy fish tacos  2  and chicken taco  1 . I could barely finish my meal because they give you so much. Not complaining because every bite was just as good as the one before.   Needless to say it is one of our new favorite Austin spots. Huge fans  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,69,The meal was excellent  or would have been if it wasn t cold  disappointed that the order service was so bad.  It would have been much faster  at least for me  to have placed an order over the phone rather than enter all sorts of required information on their website that made no difference and can only be used for marketing purposes.  I received an email saying  Estimated pickup time is 6 - 8 minutes   and I arrived about 10 minutes later. Apparently  it is not possible to call them  and talk to a real person   the store only accept texts. Sent multiple texts saying that I was in the designated parking place outside. Finally went inside  which I did not want to being high risk  and saw my order sitting on a rack  but I was told by an employee that I was not able to grab it  before the order taker could mark it off. That made sense  but having to wait another 10 minutes for the cashier to tell me that I could take it was unacceptable  she could have just written the name or order number on a piece of paper and marked it off on her register when convenient.  Ended up taking OVER 30 minutes from when I received the email which would not be a big deal  except it had gotten cold and I had based my next appointment based on the time the website promised the food and more importantly  the email that Cabo Bob sent  to me  confirming it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,70,This place is an Austin staple. Fresher than the competition  more options  and locally owned. It s a mix of Cali-Mex  Tex-Mex  and then something else that s all it s own. The  2 and  6 are my go-to s
Cabo Bob's Burritos,71,Fantastic place to get HUGE burritos. Great taste and lots of options. Similar to Chipotle but better. If you like a good burrito and are very hungry you gotta check this place out.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,72,I really enjoyed the fresh toppings and the chips and salsa with the x hot was very yummy.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,73,Not sure why there s so many good reviews for the fish tacos but I ordered them tonight and they were so bland. Tasted like nothing. Maybe I got a fluke but I definitely wouldn t come back for them. My husband really enjoyed his queso brisket burrito though.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,74,Came here on a weekend random Austin trip. Portions are huge  prices are reasonable  food is bland. So I guess you technically get what you pay for. I don t salt any of my food and all I could think about when eating this is that it needed salt. Still happy to be able to get in and out on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend without much trouble
Cabo Bob's Burritos,75,I was a little intimidated because I had never been here  it was super busy during the lunch hour  and there were SO many options. I opted for one of the specialties listed on the wall  brisket and queso  so as not to hold up the line trying to make all my choices.   I loved that they had a few different  flavors  of tortillas to choose from  and that the tortillas were  grilled  to order. I also loved the house sodas   My burrito was fantastic. Wish they had one of these where I live 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,76,Oh man they said this was chipotle-like... no way  They have a variety of tortillas and the steak burrito I got had the meat cooked different than Chipotle   I like chipotle. This one was Like-it in that it s a fast food chain with a line out the door  but the food quality was great 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,77,Easily my fave burrito spot ever. The homemade tortillas are unmatched. I always get the Baja fish on half tomatillo buttermilk. The staff are always really friendly. love this place and I hope they never change.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,78,I grew up in the Service industry as a kid and I value customer service more than I would say the most. This is my first time trying Cabo Bob s burritos and let me just tell you something  I called and got a to go order and was promptly greeted by Urban  he was very knowledgeable about their food and products line  Now I give him extra points because it happened to be six minutes before they closed  urban didn t even flinch whenever I asked him if it was too late to order something to go he happily said   that he would be more than happy to accomadate out needs  upper management is lucky to have him as an employee and from personally speaking he is awesome.  And deserves a raise  -  thank you Urban and staff 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,79,Honestly  was pretty excited to try this place out. Got the deluxe fish tacos and wow they were terrible. My expectations for this place were way to high. I did like the different drink selections but the food is very bland in taste  even with mango pico and guacamole. Even the rice was mushy and had no cilantro as stated  cilantro lime rice.  Fish was very light  tasted mostly the batter.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,80,There was about 10 people in front of me  person up front was getting orders made and the employees for some reason were doing orders wrong. I ordered a 6  first bite in and there was no queso in the burrito. Killed 15 minutes of my lunch overall trying to order and paying.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,81,I stopped by Cabo Bob s with my roommate and her mom after we went couch shopping next door. My roommate kept on describing how great the food was and we couldn t resist getting some food. We all decided to order fish tacos after seeing the reviews on Yelp. I love the Just Fish Tacos and the mango pico really adds an extra juiciness. The others also really enjoyed their Baja fish tacos. Considering the fact that we only finished two of the three tacos  this places is a delicious bang for your buck. I ll definitely be back in the future to try some of their other items.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,82,Great hangout. Giant burritos . Just wish the servings of meat were larger. Eclectic ambiance.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,83,Great place for Burritos  either pick from their menu or simply decide your own filings.  Wash it down with a Mexican Coke.  Great friendly service  I even saw one server signing to a death customer to ensure his burrito was just as perfect.  Really awesome experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,84,Wow  It s a better version of chipotle where they give you flavored tortilla options that are made fresh as ordered  Super flavorful  lots of different options for toppings  exactly on par with Chipotle in terms of price  but I really loved the chile tortilla  Also I brought my dog inside while standing in line and this seemed ok. I then sat outside enjoying the shaded patio  so dog friendly I guess.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,85,It s not good. What are you people going on about  Their guac is literally smashed avocado with NOTHING ELSE TO IT. Not even salt or garlic or cilantro or ANYTHING AT ALL. At least in a true Cali burrito you re getting real guac or the option for avocado slices  and thus know you re bringing a creamy flavor in that gives zero zing punch .  I got a cripsy fish burrito with  everything  and it was the most bland burrito I ve had in forever. It was also rolled improperly so the ingredients were doled out in segments instead of all together. The salsa was all at the bottom  which may explain why it was so bland.  Basically  Cabo Bob s read to me like someone taking the Chipotle model and giving it some interesting twists and choices. Perhaps if I had chosen a different burrito or service person to roll it  there d be another star. But no  guys. Not deserving of 4-5 stars.   Also  they weren t enforcing social distancing well enough. I had one person pressuring the people behind me to approach to order even though I had no way to move ahead because the line was stopped. One customer had his mask around his neck  another pulled hers far from her mouth to shout her order. I felt super unsafe and got a really  meh  burrito out of the risks. Oh yeah  and I ordered chips and guac and they were the worst I ve had in recollection. Sorry  Cabo Bob s  a bad review is rare from me and I won t be back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,86,Cabo bobs has the same concept as freebirds and chipotle they just have their own spin on it. I like it a lot. We got the veggie bowl and they don t charge for guacamole like the other places which was a plus cause I was going to get it no matter what. Get there early cause it fills up quick.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,87,Love this place. Amazing selection of ingredients to put in tacos  a burrito  a salad  nachos  or a salad.  They even have fish and mango salsa AND they cook the tortillas right in front of you with lots of choices to choose from   Their salsa is pretty dang good too and I absolutely love their chips and queso   They have a reward card and their customer service rocks    Wish there was one of these closer to North Austin - and thats my only complaint lol  If you have not been here - you have got to check this place out.... if there is a line  and lunch rush gets super busy - no worries  it goes super fast 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,88,Cabo Bob s Burritos is one cool joint. They have the science of making mass amounts of burritos down to a tee. Step here. Slide over. Pay. Then eat an awesome burrito. Grade  A   The wife and I where in the mood for some food  but no one could decide where to go. We are new to Austin and there are many places to try. Somehow we decided on Cabo Bob s Burritos.  I am glad we did. It was delicious. Made to order tortilla in 30 seconds. Now this is fresh. Lots of options to fill this baby up. Chicken  steak  brisket  fish  pork and veggie. All look good  but the brisket was a home run. Beautiful flavor. Yes Beautiful. It was moist. It was smokey. It was very tasty.  All the typical fillers  rice  beans  vegies  etc. Make sure you try some of the spicer sauces. It was another beautiful thing. Hot and hot and real hot. Delicious for real hot spice lovers.  Everything was fresh and cooked in small batches to maximize freshness. Let s face it  712 reviews  4.5 stars. Something good is happening. The people have spoken.  Cabo Bob s Burritos  is an excellent choice for an inexpensive meal. Fun ambiance. Plenty of seating. CC friendly. Fast service with a smile. Plenty of parking. No beer. Ouch  but lot s of non-alcoholic beverage options.  I ll be back.....
Cabo Bob's Burritos,89,This place is always packed   I love that you can pick out what tortilla you want and they press it right there and cook it in front of you. What I don t love is that sometimes they stick and can get a little disfigured  but that makes your tortilla have character right    I ve always had take out and the line can go pretty quick. My favorites are the crispy fish tacos and the steak burrito. The steak burrito has a choice of beans and also a choice of rice. Love options and I m glad this place opened and it s way better than chipotle. I mean  who wants to get food poisoning  Not me    Next time you re in there try the mint sweet tea. It s extra refreshing 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,90,Best burritos in Austin   Fresh food  fast service  amp  staff is always polite. My top 5 places to eat in AUSTIN  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,91,Quite disappointing being they have a 4 1 2 star rating making me skipped out on my Asian to try something new. The line was to the door which is fine but it took near 30 minutes to get to order because staff was extremely slow and disorganized. I highly suggest y all to check in with Freebirds staff management    Okay so 19 bucks for our  8 chicken burrito and  3  3 fish tacos. Burrito was dry and the salsa took the taste buds off my tounge. The fish tacos where  okay  even though it looked like something my kids eat from the freezer isle. I m SO disappointed and hope it was just a bad day but if you re like me and seek something new regularly you might want to think twice on this one.  I m adding a star for the immediate response from management.  For being attentive
Cabo Bob's Burritos,92,Cabo Bob s for the win  Seriously  how many ways can you do a burrito theme   Lots of tortilla options  cooked fresh before your eyes  After coming here for several years  I just found out that they will even mix your tortilla flavors  No kidding  the dude in front of me asked for an Ancho Chili  amp  Cilantro tortilla  and the tortilla maker guy just grabs both doughs  tears them and mixes them  What  Whole new world if you re a tortilla fan.   Anyway  lots of other options as well. I m a salad guy myself on account of the fact that I look a bit like Tommy Boy if I eat too many tortillas  but the salad with the right fixin s and salsas  and it s a winner every time.   I also snag some chips  amp  queso  and go to town on that. The chips have a great freshly cooked crunch  and the queso works perfect with it. Not like that nasty queso they have at another burrito joint.  So yeah  hit up Cabo Bob s. Be prepared for all the options  and enjoy  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,93,Wohoo   Love this Mexican place. They make burrito in front of you.Also  they have much to offer in their menu. It s a lit  chipotle. What I love    1. Price point is amazing  2.staff service on mark. 3. Taste top notch  Burrito are made from scratch in front of you.Salsa and other condiments are made from scratch too. Nice location you can go Walmart shopping  from here     It s   distance 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,94,Great atmosphere and food  I loved the vegan burrito  got it in a bowl  and my family enjoyed their meals as well  chicken tacos  steak burrito  and a few build your own options . The burritos are large and super fresh. The staff was also great  really friendly.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,95,There s a reason there s usually a pretty long line here. There are a lot of burrito joints in Austin  but Cabo Bob s is one of the best.  The main difference in a burrito is the ingredients  of course . They have 4 different types of tortilla wraps and when you order  they smash it down and grill right before they start putting in the ingredients. Doesn t get any fresher than that. I love the smokey cheddar tortilla.  I usually get the shredded pork or chicken  but they have steak  brisket and very nice looking fried fish  I just don t like fried fish getting soggy in a burrito . They have three different types of beans and two types of rice as well as the usual other fillings.  Their burritos are huge and I never am able to eat a whole one which is a shame because they don t taste quite as good warmed up later.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,96,Their curbside is super on point and PERSONABLE      Cabo bobs has a vibe and QUALITY that s chipotle could neva
Cabo Bob's Burritos,97,One of my go to Mexican spots near UT. Love the soft tortillas. I m a fan of the rice bowl here along with their fresh guac. I m not a fan of Cabo Bob s Queso as it is a little runny but great nachos and rice bowl options available here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,98,Best fish tacos I ve had in a long time  Good fresh ingredients.  Curbside pickup available and though the line was long on a Saturday night  the staff worked hard to service quickly.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,99,My favorite local burritos  11 10 every time. A must eat for me when visiting the city. My favorite thing is the cilantro tortillas and the reusable drink cup hehe You can enjoy a delicious casual meal for a budget friendly price. YOU ROCK CABO BOB s     
Cabo Bob's Burritos,100,The manager needs to tell his cook to cover is nose. The cook was  dick nosing  over his mask. All the front line servers and cashiers were wearing their masks correctly. Love their food  but their cook today at 1 00 pm needs to follow proper safety protocols.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,101,Cabo bob s is not bad and cheap. It was super crowded when we came on a Saturday near 2pm. Line was long  no tables available  and when they did have some  they were dirty and had trash left behind. The tacos here are cheap and good but I wish they double wrapped their tacos. Their tortillas are made in house and super delicious so why not add two  Plus they re so thin they break. The fish is my go to and I get the number 2 off the specialty menu with fish.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,102,We decided to stop in at Cabo Bob s on our way from Houston to Fredericksburg  as it was right off the highway and the reviews were great   I have to say  overall  it was different but I would not say it was  better than Freebird   it was just different than Freebird.  I ordered the tacos with the chile tortilla.  They heat the tortillas to be super crispy which is cool and again  lends to this being different from the other places.  I got the fish and 2 chicken tacos.  While I hate fried food  I did think the fish was the bomb  especially loaded up with all the extras including the really hot sauce.   I would definitely stop here again if in the area.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,103,GREAT burritos and excellent service by Angie and the rest of the friendly staff. I ordered the  4 fish burrito and the  2 deluxe fish tacos and it was HUGE. The burrito came with 6 crispy pieces of fish  awesome pico-de-gallo and tasty hot sauce. It s hard to find a good burrito in Texas  because everyone just makes tacos. I m happy I found Cabo Bob s. I ll definitely be back again and again.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,104,Come here often. Last time our to-go food was really bad and then decided to give them another chance. Just waited for 30 minutes in a not even long line and when I went to check out I mentioned to the manager that our experience was poor last time and he gave zero shits. Just awful customer service.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,105,Wow  what a bad experience from a place my family and I loved  I ordered food to go for my family and I and when I get home with the food after a 30 min drive there and back i open the bag and the order is all wrong  my tacos made incorrectly  queso and chips missing  sauces not added  the tacos looked like some one stepped on them  and just the simple things  like putting orders in individual bags so you don t have to open every taco to see which is yours and which is your family s  after talking to a manager  she just said that if I wanted to drive there and back I can pick up the missing items  or she could refund the queso and chips  she really sounded careless and indifferent about the situation  the sad thing is that this wasn t my first messed up to go  I told the manager that  I m trying to support local restaurants during this pandemic  but some make it really hard to do so.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,106,this place has been a regular spot for years  their fish burrito is my  F A V E .  and they are like 85  consistent - the other 15  is when i ve gotten not-so-fresh-tasting fish  and the one time i didn t get any mango pico   BUT they are always solid in accommodating   making up for it when it s bad enough that i have to say something  rare . and stuff like that usually happens when i accidentally go during lunch rush - i try not to  they get SLAMMED - so i m never mad about it. they keep me coming back though  especially the chips  which have been stale maybe once in 6 years. i always order ahead now  and curbside is easy. i knocked off a star for the one person working without a mask  in stage 5    . and special shoutout to Daniel doing the to-go orders last time - for reminding me about my punch card  and also selecting theee best brownie... how did you know i love corner pieces     
Cabo Bob's Burritos,107,This place puts Freebirds and Chipotle to shame. The tortillas are freshly made right in front of you. I usually make my own  Buttermilk Flour Tortilla  Steak  Chipotle Crema  Cilantro Lime Rice  Black Beans  Shredded Cheese  Guacamole  and Lime Juice  and it s consistently great.  Going to keep going every time I visit Austin to see if I can make a better burrito. Come give it a try 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,108,My favorite Burrito place. If you haven t been here yet you re missing out   Everything on the menu tastes great and I mean e v e r y t h i n g    My favorite to get is the pork. My son loves to top his with lime juice. Veggies are grilled perfectly. Tortillas are freshly made in front of you. My mouth salivates thinking about their food.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,109,Absolutely love this place   Burrito s as big as your head   Fresh ingredients and tortillas made on the spot.  The ambiance reminds me of costal Baja Mexico.  Staff was friendly and service was fairly fast.  When we arrived the line was out the door and we were eating in less than 15 minutes.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,110,I m am so glad Bob decided to bring his culinary burrito talents from Cabo to Austin  Tortilla  exquisite. Meat  amazing. Sauces  varied. Queso  delicious. Toppings  oh so many   This place is so gosh darn good. Get a burrito now 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,121,This is one of my favorite fish taco stops in Austin  The fish is fried and the chunks are decent size. We had ordered the Deluxe Fish Tacos. The order includes three tacos which are unique. For example  the tortillas are cilantro tomatillo tortilla  the second is an anch chilli and the third is a buttermilk tortilla. The filler ingredients are chipotle crema  pico-de-gallo with mango  guacamole  cheese  finely shredded cabbage  lime and fresh crispy fried fish. The deluxe fish was my ultimate favorite. You can taste all the various ingredients from the crispy fired fish  avocado  cheese the smooth cream  tangy lime and spicy chipotle with a little crunch from the cabbage and finally the unique tortillas. Overall  a really delicious food and the service was fast and friendly. If you are looking for a quick  casual  tasty meal  this is a good stop.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,122,So glad I finally tried this place  Better than chipotle and free birds  It s soooo good and can t even believe I out off trying them for so long. I just wish they were open on sundays.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,123,Not the best tacos I have ever had  but pretty good  and very generous portions  probably the biggest tacos I have ever had.   The menu was a bit confusing but the employees were all very friendly and helpful. You can mix and match the taco plate. Comes with 3 tacos. I got the deluxe fish  the brisket and queso and the Bobs chicken. The deluxe fish was my ultimate favorite. The brisket and queso was pretty yummy. Meh on the bobs chicken. We also got a side of chips  queso and guac. The queso was really good but the guac tasted processed and not very fresh.   It was very busy on 2 00 on a Friday  there wasn t any inside seating. Clearly a popular place.  The parking lot is a mess  getting in wasn t hard but it took forever to escape.   I don t live in the area and I don t know if this would be at the top of my list to stop at when I m back in town  but if you are in the area and want decent tacos  huge portions  at a pretty fair price  and friendly service come here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,124,food is great  lady at the front Theresa was openly very rude to me and several employees in the five minutes i was there. not to mention the only one not wearing a mask. i will not be returning to this location.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,125,Yum   Came to Austin for the week and this place was on my list of things to try. I was pleasantly surprised with the burritos  It was really tasty and the queso is delicious too. I will be back forsure
Cabo Bob's Burritos,126,Delicious food and the prices are definitely desirable. Friendly staff and will definitely be back 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,127,On a road trip from Ontario  Canada to the West Coast  and stopped here to get some  fuel for the journey . Wow  The kids and I were all impressed  Fresh  quality ingredients  Great drink options too  We would come back again  if in the area... 5 stars all the way      Lots of easy  free parking too 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,128,Cabo Bob s is just plain ol  good  consistently fast food. For burritos  tacos and bowls  I find them way better than Chipotle or those other order-down-the-line  I made that up   chains. The tortillas are fresh. Like  made right in front of yo  face fresh...and there are several interesting tortilla flavors  think ancho chili or something tomatillo  and lots of toppings to choose from. Their queso is good. Their chips are great. Each order is way more food than I can ever eat  so I never leave still hungry. Parking is ample and prices are right. The only reason Bob didn t get five stars is because every time I come for lunch they are PACKED  and there aren t enough tables  especially in summer when it s too hot for the patio. Maybe they can knock out the store next door and double their size   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,129,So i had no expectations of this place when seeing it on Yelp  the stars are  stars   but wow this place is LEGIT   Visiting from FL  all we have is Chipotle  Moe s SW Grille  Baja Burrito  Tijuana Flats  etc   but this place rises above from all of them.   The choices of type of tortilla you get is amazing  not just  corn  or  flour   but actual flavors infused into the soft-shell tortilla itself  and the way it s made is awesome as can be. - the mango salsa is to die for. - the  beef  meat is actually large chunks of steak  yum   - the place it pretty big and can house plenty of people. - the workers there seem to love their job and actually enjoy being there.   When it comes to burritos  nothing in FL can really top this place in terms of size  choice and quality. One of the best things about Austin is actually coming here to eat the food since it s that good.  While I m not a local of Austin  TX  based out of Orlando  FL  this place certainly gives other taco burrito places a run for it s money when it comes to price  efficiency and the quality of food that is served.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,130,I love Cabo bobs  It s like a high class chipotle or free birds lol. Seriously though  the food seems fresh  and taste really good 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,131,Great place to eat lots of food for the money clean and friendly bartenders  That make you feel at home thank you will come back to visit again
Cabo Bob's Burritos,132,These burritos are amazing. Line is usually long during lunch but its totally worth the wait.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,133,The best burritos in the world  The size of the burritos makes 2 full meals. I love getting their fish  6 pieces most of the time. The mango pico is TDF. Their customer loyalty punch card  after 6 punches you get a free burrito or free tshirt. I have 3 shirts  they re my favorites. I also got 1 for my mom and still have gotten a couple free burritos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,134,I don t write reviews often but Cabo deserves it. My go to spot. I d say I eat here about 2 times a week. Once you go Cabo you can t go back. Bye bye chip  le and fr  birds. Better meat  better queso  better beans  better veggies. They ve even got better sauces. The workers are beyond awesome at this location. They always give great customer service.   Pro tip   get the bowl and a tortilla on the side. Best bang for your buck
Cabo Bob's Burritos,135,My cousin and I had flown to Austin to pick a car  before getting on the road to head back to Dallas we decided to stop for lunch. We were VERY impressed with the food. The establishment was crowded but the line moved quickly. I know you re able to pick different flavor tortillas which we did but they all tasted the same to us. There are a log of different sauces you can try. The next time I m in Austin I ll stop there 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,136,Freshly made tortillas will always have my heart. The cilantro tortillas are especially fitting for your fish tacos  It is a make your own bar  think Chipotle or Qdoba but much more delicious. I think I have found a new lunch spot when I am craving Mexican. Additionally the staff were SO nice and attentive  making the overall experience amazing.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,137,Horrible.... 9 for this little bit of food. Little bit of lettuce and a table spoon of chicken with avocado.  Cost me  9 cost them .85 cents....worse customer service ever...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,138,After moving 100s of miles away from Austin 2 years ago  I find myself daydreaming about Cabo Bobs fish tacos. I want one so bad right now. If that s not a sign of how good they are  I don t know what is.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,139,Well I finally made it to Cabo Bobs   I was absolutely surprised with the quality of food.  I was kind of expecting freebirds I guess but a little different.  My cousin was in town and mentioned he wanted fish tacos  so Steve H. looked up the top places to get fish tacos in Austin on what else but the yelp app ... and the  1 place was too far so we opted for  2 which was Cabo Bobs.    I ordered the  1 fish tacos on a smoked cheddar tortilla.  There was a mango pico de gallo and a creamy chipotle sauce with 2 huge chunks of golden fried fish  cabbage and a lime on the side.  I squeezed the lime juice on each taco and as I ate them the mango pico  creamy sauce and lime juice mixed around on the fish and tortilla ... mmm it totally hit the spot.  The chips and salsa were good too   And they have all the Dublin real cane sugar drinks on fountain ... my favorite is the red cream soda    All in all our whole table was pleased and loved their lunch.  I am glad I finally tried Cabo Bobs.  I will absolutely hit this place up again   I think it is better than Freebirds and Chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,140,Visiting Austin for one day and stumbled on this place on yelp.  Very fresh food with freshly made tortillas of different variety in front of your eyes.  Food is served in bowl or burrito  taco style with different fillings.  Fish and chicken filling were really good.  Fountain and bottle drinks.  Lots of sittings and good parking space.  Lots of university students but families here too.  Lively and clean spot with long line but fast.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,141,I got the Bob s Chicken Bowl and it was pretty tasty but I have to admit that it wasn t quite as flavorful as Chipotle to me. However  I m sure I m the minority but it was way better than Freebirds. I would like to try it again and order something else because it s possible I just didn t get the right thing.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,142,I cannot say enough good things about Cabo Bob s.  They have delicious  home made flour tortillas that are authentic.  Their ingredients are always fresh and their jalapeno salsa is to die for   Their customer service is consistently solid and the line generally moves pretty fast.  This is my go-to place for burrito bowls tacos.  The steak fajita is so flavorful and tender.  Cabo Bob s is one of my favorite Austin gems.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,143,When stopping in Austin this is a must. I drive to Austin twice a month for business and I stop here every time. Need some in Dallas soon   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,144,First time experience was more than fantastic  Food was made to perfection  understatement . Management approached us to check in and to give us a quick overview of its history and it s food preparation. Very satisfied 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,145,This place hands down rolls over Freebirds and Chipotle   I get the beef or chicken  and the fact that they have multi colored flavored options for your tortilla is just sweet.. The prices are comparable to Chipotle s but they have soooo many more options to put on your burro pile of food. I eat a lot and half of a giant burro is more than enough to satiate your appetite   The cups they give away are pretty sweet as well  the graphics . Very nice place to hang out indoors or out  sport bar vibey.  Definitively check it out while in ATX 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,146,First time trying this place  got their Veggie burrito on the cilantro tomatillo tortilla and it was delicious  No salsa required  packed with flavor. I ll definitely be back for more.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,147,It was okay  wish the meat had a little more flavor. It just felt like a less tasty version of chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,148,Service is good and efficient. Love their fish tacos  Highly recommend  they have bowls  tacos  burritos and fresh homemade tortillas.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,149,not kidding this is the BEST TEX MEX in austin. I go to school in fort worth but come here the second i get into town. erasmo knows me and my sister by name and even knows our orders- everyone here is extremely friendly and the food is insanely good. the line goes by fast  great vibes inside  and make sure to get the queso and guacamole   also their chicken slaps.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,150,CABO BOB S IS THE BOMB   Hands down  best burrito place in Austin...Makes competitors like Chipotle  Qdoba  and Freebirds look like a joke.  You can get burritos  tacos  or salad bowl and even give you selection of different types of tortillas. The tortillas are made fresh right in front of you and they cook all their meats on Big Green Egg grills. They also have queso  salsas  and their own house made hot sauce.  They also do punch-cards so you can get a free burrito after 6 visits. HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,151,Cabo Bob s is SO good. As a first timer to this place I wasn t sure what to expect but was very impressed. I would compare it to Chipotle  but that doesn t even do it justice. The tortillas are made right in front of you and the ingredients have a lot of variety and look very fresh. The mint sweet tea was AMAZING. Would recommend 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,152,This place cuts corners close to close and makes it s called in orders priority.   Went in tonight and waited thirty minutes for a softball sized burrito with crusty ass carnitas. I requested to add fresh queso to it but they just got done scraping the bottom of their 1 6 pan so they were all out.  For the love of god learn how to cook rice. You re a burrito joint.  I wondered why I stopped going here. Now I know.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,153,Got a fish bowl and a beef bowl to go. Around  7- 8 each  good amount    Similar concepts as Chipotle  you pick your meet  vege and as many toppings as you want. And the freshness of the food here is better in my opinion.  The red hot sauce have a strong smoky BBQ favor.  Tons of parking.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,154,You know how places get too over hyped and it sometimes makes you not want to go because you feel like you might be disappointed   Well it happens to me.   My brother and his friends got some burritos last time and my brother gave me a bite of his. With just that one bite I was sold. Since then I ve been going constantly. It s actually a little embarrassing lol.   Why is this place better than Chipotle   Their tortillas are seasoned and flavored  Yeah I know Freebirds has different kinds of tortillas but come on Cabo does them better. They have your regular buttermilk  ancho chili  cheddar  and cilantro. I always go for the ancho chili tortilla to spice things further. Another thing I love about Cabo is the big selection of sauces    They have Red salsa  hot tomatillo sauce  ancho chili sauce  Chipotle crema and some other ones I have yet to try  I feel like the sauces are what makes the burrito taste even more awesome. I mean come on who wants a plain dry burrito    If you hate crowds like I do then you should definitely order online  It s surprisingly quicker than I had expected considering the big lines they sometimes get. I haven t dine in yet so I can t speak about customer service in depth but everytime I go to pick up my food  someone is always there to help me right away despite the line of people ordering to my right. One of the managers  Erasmo  is very kind and friendly. If there s ever a problem he tries to do right by the customer to fix their orders.  I definitely recommend this place to everyone. Stop going to Chipotle and go to Cabo Bob s instead. Plus they have a  buy 6 burritos and get a free shirt  stamp card 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,155,I m heaping another good review on the pile.   Wife had three tacos and declared the Fish Tacos to be the best option of the three.   I went with a surprisingly moist brisket burrito. Enjoyed every bite. Don t let the size fool you  it s about the same amount of food you get at Freebirds but it s not tightly packed and rolled like FB prefers to do.   Fresh tortillas make this a really different choice over other fast casual burrito and taco places.   I don t come to Austin often but I d eat here again.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,156,This was a great stop for dinner on a road trip.  I ve not been to place like this that does fish in their burritos or tacos  so this was a welcome change.  You get 4 different types of tortillas  though I don t think they have any corn options.  They are all very tasty though.  You can pick your choice of meats along with all the sides and toppings you want.  I ended up with a pretty monstrous burrito that filled me up.  If you order tacos  you get 3 of them in pretty big portions as well.  Their choice of sides is decent and they have lots of sauces to choose from.  I m not sure exactly why  but we were comped some chips and queso and also managed to get a few extra tortillas to try out.  The place works quickly  are friendly  and relatively inexpensive for what you get.  Even though the fish was decent  next time  I d try some other options just to see how they turn out.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,157,It was fast and easy  not a long line. I got the fish tacos and they were delicious  A great local chain  definitely a go-to place for easy eats 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,158,Definitely prefer this place over chipotle on the next street on stassney. The chicken here is always juicy and can t  forget the shredded pork is also very good. Plus always have nice staff and clean patio.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,159,Cabo bobs is pretty good. Their system for ordering and picking up during covid is easy and efficient. I like the fish in the burrito and the options for other fillings. I really like their xx hot sauce and always ask for extra.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,160,Lately I am almost always disappointed when eating out  however we picked up some Cabo Bob s today and it was fabulous. I got the Baja Tacos. It was fresh and the portion was substantial and the price reasonable. Reminds me of San Diego food. The fish did not taste fishy and the chips didn t taste like old oil  like you find at so many places. My partner had a burrito and it was amazing also. Great Job Bob   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,161,I m not a huge fan of big burrito s. I think I have an intense hatred of Freebirds. That being said Cabo Bobs had such a high yelp rating for so long that I felt I had to give it a try. It being so close to work made it convenient to do so.  So I was going to get a salad or some sorta bowl option which is what I always do when I have to eat at some place like this but when I got in the line which seemed to be moving very fast and efficiently I couldn t help but notice they were making the tortillas for the burritos right away and then using them. This looks like it could turn out to be better than your average sticky lowest common form a bread tortilla so I decided to go with the Pork Burrito.   I selected some sort of cheese flavored tortilla.. and started going through the line. I got rice  beans  guacamole  onions and all the fixings. They made the biggest burrito for me I have ever seen.   I got back to work and settled in to eat it .. now the tortilla was sticky and gross I ll probably not get tricked into trying the burrito again. The pork was very tasty and the price and speed of service was awesome.   Also the cane sugar soda selection is unmatched. I got cane sugar big peach and it was amazing. I think I would have enjoyed my food more if I would have just gotten the salad. I also cant wait to try the Baja Fish Taco s.   I says give these guys a chance its good food 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,162,The disappointment from my online order. I ordered the Baja fish tacos with extra cheese and extra mango pico  the tacos come with it but we love it so we get extra. The taco had no cheese  that I paid for and the tacos had no chipotle sauce on them  very dry. They did give me some on the side but that in my opinion is the extra I requested. My Bf and I love the fish tacos but it appears the order is only correct when we order in person. We live in SM and make the drive just for Cabo bobs. I disappoint myself every time I order online. This isn t the first time. It s been like a hand full of times in the last 5 years we ve been ordering. It s always missing something I ve requested  but with the extra hot sauce and queso we get  it s still good and we continue to order here. It would be nice if the person who reads the order could kindly make it as requested. The food is good but i shouldn t have to walk the line just to make sure it s the way I want it. I would have to recommend eating there to truly enjoy it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,163,This place makes the best burrito I ve ever had. I will never eat at chipotle  freebirds  or Qdoba ever again
Cabo Bob's Burritos,164,This was the first place I choose to dine at my first time in Texas for some Tex-Mex.  Prior to eating here I ve always heard   tacos are better in Texas...   from so many people. I never thought tacos could get any better than what I ve had in California or even from certain places in Florida. But boy  was I highly mistaken.  This place has ruined any taco I will eat from here on out. I can t even eat Chipotle anymore  because I realized it s straight garbage.  The moment I saw the dining attendant hand press the tortilla I knew it was game over. They even had different flavors of tortillas  The brisket and the pulled pork tacos were awesome  I even ordered crispy fish nachos to split and my friend ordered an over stuffed burrito.   Well it s true what they say-everything is bigger in Texas indeed. We only got through 1 4 of the nachos and I could only make my way through 2 out of three tacos. They were stuffed to the brim.   All in all I would definitely pay a visit back to this establishment if I m in the area. Great value and awesome food 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,165,Amazing burritos and burrito bowls  I loved the ancho Chile tortilla  cilantro was okay but not bad. They make this hot tortilla in front of you and add the burrito ingredients as you like. We tried veggie burrito from the menu which was little dry for us  but once we added sauce and sour cream it was awesome  I also tried their veggie bowl so much tastier than chipotle   Totally recommend my vegetarian and vegan friends to visit this place  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,166,Frreesssh tortillas  smashed and toasted in front of your eyes.  There s just something that makes me giddy with anticipation when I see the balls of dough mashed the the giant press and then toss on the revolving hot plate.  I love how fresh everything tastes here - although I always go back to the fish tacos.  They re just smashingly good.  Definitely use the hot sauces too - tasty and well worth it  extra spicy does actually have a little kick  .  If you want sodas - it s all pure cane sugar rush for you.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,167,Holy burrito Batman  I had the  4 fish burrito on the cilantro tomatillo tortilla and it could have easily fed 3 people. This is the kinda food that you just can t stop eating because it s so good. I added white rice  black beans  onions  green peppers  they put on 5 pieces of fried fish  salsa  cheese and sour cream. I m drooling just thinking back to it again. Definitely worth waiting in line and worth the money for such a big portion. It s like Chipotle or Qdoba  but better 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,168,This place is awesome. Their food is top notch and they have been extremely efficient in implementing a takeout system. Easily one of my favorite restaurants and I hope to continue eating here for years.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,169,I ordered some nachos with steak  queso and whole  pinto beans. The steak was so so kinda chewy. Queso was runny and not thick. The beans had no salt. I didn t care for the ancho hot sauce. The best thing was the thickness of the nacho chip. It held up with all the toppings and did not get soggy. For the price you can t beat it. It s also filling and I didn t try all of the other options that were available for toppings but it s a good mixture of items. I will go again and try the burrito. The tortillas looked yummy and huge  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,170,Similar to the likes of Chipotle and Freebird s  Cabo Bob s is a build your own burrito style restaurant.  I found this location during a recent trip to Austin and am glad I did. While you can always build your own burrito  you can also choose from a menu of 5-6 burritos to choose from. I tried my burrito on a smoked cheddar tortilla and it was a perfect compliment to the rest of my meal. We also had chips and queso on the side of our burritos  which was delicious  The atmosphere is very chill and a great place for a quick lunch or casual dinner. The staff making our burritos were all business - they hardly had time for niceties as it was lunch time and very busy on the day we went.   Definitely going back to visit.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,171,Found this place on a whim when I had an hour to kill before meeting up with some friends. I grabbed a quick bite here and was pleasantly surprised. With the influx of Chipotle clones  Cabo Bobs stands out.  The fresh tortillas is what sets them apart--ever so slightly crispy and delightful. I had the fried fish tacos. To be honest  the fish wasn t that great but as a whole taco unit thing  everything was great.  Oh  do yourself a favor and try the hot sauce. It has a nice smokey flavor and a decent kick.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,172,This is a Chipotle concept but so much better.  The tortilla was freshly pressed for my burrito as I placed my order and the ingredients used to assemble it appear to be much more fresh.  The line does get a bit long and it is overwhelming making so many choices  but that adds to the uniqueness of creating whatever your taste buds are feeling at the time.  The pricing for the portions is spot on and a great place to grab a quick lunch or dinner.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,173,It s pretty good  fresh and varieties in flavors . This is like the higher end of Chipotle lol
Cabo Bob's Burritos,174,Tacos were good  but definitely nothing to write home about. It s a cool atmosphere but still feels like a chain. If you re in Austin there are a ton of places to get tacos  so I d prefer a hole in the wall over this type of establishment. Still decent tho.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,175,I am always beyond impressed with the freshness of the food  cleanliness of the restaurant  and friendliness of the staff.   Today however I wanted to focus on a specific individual. I just happened to be in there just the other week and forgot to make this review.   A group of hearing impaired persons were in line in front of me and I was beyond impressed with the way Robert took care of them. Not only was he signing with them  which I am sure they appreciated greatly   but he also took the time to slow things down a bit so that they didnt feel rushed moving through the line. To me  the level of service Robert provided was nothing short of stellar and I am hoping that one of his managers takes the time to read this to him.   Thank you Robert for all you do. And thank you to the entire staff for not only making a group feel great about being in your house  but for having that same great attitude every time I walk through that door too. Keep up the good food and good work 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,176,We wasted 30 minutes in line tonight behind 5 or so other parties. We had to leave seeing that we were still 10-20 minutes from getting food. The issue seems to be that to-go orders take precedence over people in line.  Until they learn to balance to-go and in-house customers I won t be back  which is disappointing considering the food has been great in the past.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,177,I m currently eating vegan and I was pleasantly surprised that they advertise a vegan burrito  It was delicious   Their homemade tortilla chips were so good too  When I m feeling like cheating with fish   this is the place I ll go. The fried fish looked awesome  Everyone s burritos were HUGE too. Great price for the quality and quantity 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,178,Cabo Bob s is a casual Chipotle-like burrito joint. It was a nice place to enjoy a casual weeknight dinner. - Ambiance  The inside has a casual  surfer feel with a counter for ordering. It was clean and spacious. Even though the restaurant was fairly crowded  it was easy to find a place to sit. - Service  The counter ordering was not as fast as I expected  but I appreciated that each person was willing to accommodate special requests and answer any questions about the food. - Food Drinks  I made my own bowl with chicken  brown rice  and black beans with a variety of toppings. The tortillas are cooked fresh to order. They happily accommodate my request to have a cilantro tomatillo tortilla on the side. All the food was fresh and delicious. I much preferred it to any other burrito chains. They served a variety of bottled and fountain drinks. Only complaint is the only non-diet darker soda tasted like it was not working properly so we had to grab a diet Coke instead. - Value  The food is high quality and delicious and the portions are large. I had enough leftover for a meal the following day 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,179,Amazing meal overall  I recommend the Smokey cheddar burrito but truly everything is amazing and tastes fresh  Honestly  would definitely recommend overall chipotle and freebirds.  The price point is perfect and an amazing lunch or dinner deal with the perfect amount of food.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,180,A nice alternative to chipotle or freebirds  The line is always super long around lunchtime  so you know other people are a fan too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,181,Seriously  I don t know why anyone goes to chipotle  qdoba  or any of those fakers when you have Cabo bobs. It simply smashes all of them. They make your tortilla fresh and to order   You can choose from a multitude of flavors or even combine some. They put it on the press as dough and 1min later  you have a hot fresh flour tortilla. Love their toppings as well  do yourself a favor and get the fish   queso drizzled on top. If you re a real pro  you get the tacos instead of the burrito. Tacos come out to be larger and you get to try multiple fillings. Would stay away from the nachos though  not worth it compared to the burrito taco.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,182,Love their food. Some of my favorite fast food. The fact they do the tortillas on order and the meat is cooked by the egg sets them apart from everyone   Congrats on excellence and continuing to grow    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,183,Cabo Bob is great  Casual environment  great food with nice portion  amp  friendly people    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,184,We had Cabo Bob s in catering form and it was delicious. Everything fresh and really tasty. I made a bowl with beans  chicken  all the sauces  guac  and a little queso. I would highly recommend this if you have a Tex-Mex craving  but want to keep it fresh. I will certainly be going back   Big thumbs up  thanks for the delicious food 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,185,If you haven t been to CABO BOBS run there  NOW  except if it s Sunday because they re closed that day   It s like Chipotle but SO MUCH better  and doesn t even come close   First of all they make their own tortillas  Smokey Cheddar  Ancho Chile  and more  From there you ll pick your protein  fajita chicken steak  brisket  fried fish  a variety of beans  sauce  mango and regular pico  queso  guac  rice and much more   They offer tacos  burritos  bowls  salads  and nachos  build your own or select from their menu   My go-to is the 4 tacos on Smokey cheddar  white rice  fried fish  onions  cheese  sour cream  mango pico  and chipotle crema  if I m really hungry I ll get chips and queso too  Cabo Bobs is THE BEST 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,186,I m out of town and decided I wanted a taco of sorts  so of course I checked Yelp first and found Cabo Bob s. The setup reminds me of Chipotle  in that you select your burrito  salad or bowl choice  and then decide what you want to load it with  with the options presented before you . This place is like a cross between Chipotle and Torchy s  however the food tastes more like Chipotle... If there s a connection  I m not aware of it. The food wasn t great and wasn t bad  it was just ok. I was excited to check it out because the reviews were awesome. ...Meh.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,187,I don t know how to describe these burritos in words. Delicious  incredible  amazing  Still not enough. If you ever find yourself in Austin hungry  please do not go anywhere but Cabo Bob s. They start making the burritos with your choice of tortilla  including cilantro tomatillo  ancho chile  and other flavors. They fill each burrito with your choice of rice  beans  meat  grilled chicken is my favorite   grilled veggies  don t say no  they re free   salsas  and the typical fixings. Some of my personal favorites are the fresh lime juice  and the hot tomatillo salsa. If you don t like spicy food  then you are missing out  sadly. Their hot sauces are INCREDIBLE. I cannot get enough of their XXtra Hot. The line at this place tends to get quite long around peak hours  so come hungry  but come prepared to wait. There is plenty of parking at this location  it is just a little hard to get here when you re coming off the exit from I-35. The right turn by the Chick-Fil-A is easy to miss...I know because I ve done it almost every time. Prices are very reasonable here  about  7-9 for a burrito  prices vary based upon meat selection . I wish I had pictures  but I always end up forgetting because I start to chow down. When I go again  I will try to remember to take some.   Bottom Line  Low key fast casual   Chipotle-style   burrito joint with high quality  flavorful  reasonably priced food. Pro-tip  do not get a bowl  they re just not as good. HIGHLY recommend 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,188,Great staff and atmosphere  They are always very patient  helpful and friendly each time I go. After trying multiple things on the menu  my decided favorite is a brisket salad loaded with everything from sauteed veggies to guacamole. Yummy  Keep up the good work Cabo Bob s and make sure to take care of that incredible staff you have 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,189,I always notice this place when I go to Chick-fil-A and figured it was just another Taco Cabana type of restaurant.  So glad it popped up on Yelp when I searched  burritos  with a 4.5 star review  reinforcing the fact that I shouldn t judge a book by its cover    When I noticed the big green eggs  I knew we were going to have some good food.  I had a steak fajita burrito in a cilantro tomatillo tortilla  and my boyfriend had 3 tacos with various meats.  He felt that the tacos weren t enough food  but he s a pretty big eater.  My burrito was fabulous and I was truly impressed how juicy and tender the steak was   The burrito stayed together well  and I was only able to finish half of it before I was full.  It stayed intact enough for me to wrap it up in some foil and take it home.  I also tried the ancho rancho and chipotle crema sauces.  They were both super yummy  but I prefer the chipotle crema.  The prices are unbeatable and this place  while similar to Chipotle  is WAY better than Chipotle.  Definitely going to be a new fast food staple in our household.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,190,This Cabo s location is always good except tonight. I placed an online order for pickup at 8 00pm at around 7 15pm. Got there right at 8 food was barely warm which isn t too bad I mean using a microwave isn t the end of the world but when I paid extra for queso on my burrito but no queso... kind of dry..... Also my wife s bowl didn t have any guac which we paid extra for as well. Make sure your order is correct before you leave or you may end up paying extra for nothing but I prefer this location over others.  Update  The Manager did contact me and offered to replace my meal which was not my intentions  I love Cabo bobs and I think it s wonderful that he reached out  That is customer service at its best  Even though I probably won t redeem it because that s not why I wrote this. But major props for the General Manager 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,191,Guys  Why in the world would anyone go to Chipotle when we have this gem amongst us   The tortillas like all the other ingredients are FRESH  Homemade tortillas is what really sets Cabo Bob s apart from all the other burrito places  flavorful meats and great salsas combine forces to kick your tastebuds into high gear. They have a great selection of drinks and since they aren t sell outs you won t see any Pepsi Coca Cola brands here  just good ol cane sugar sweetened drinks. Oh and they have the good ice too... you ll think of me when you try it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,192,This place is one of my go to places for lunch. The service is fast and the tortillas are fresh  The fish tastes amazing and has a nice crunch. It s usually packed around lunch time so if you need to get in and out fast I suggest you come before 12. It s usually pretty quick though so if there is a line don t let it deter you. The fresh brewed tea is also on point.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,193,11 30am Called today to try to see how long the wait was because my office has never been to this restaurant. Lady on the phone said she was too busy to bother talking to me and she let me go. Obviously they don t need any more new business at this restaurant. We will never be showing up here ever.  12 45pm Ok  update. The manager of the restaurant contacted me and assured me that is not the normal service they expect from their employees. So I m gonna give it a try next week.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,194,Better than chipotle  Great meats and the pick your own tortilla flavor is awesome.  Ask for samples to try the meats out before you build  they re all delicious.  Cute environment 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,195,Cabo Bob s is my personal temple   The fresh tortillas are bomb  my fave is cilantro and ancho chile mixed   the ingredients are fresh and tasty.  Best vegan burrito I ve ever had  Get it with jalapenos  mango pico and extra guacamole.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,196,Chipotle who  Freebirds what    This place is the bomb diggity. We rocked up at 8 55 and the place closed at 9. I know  we were THOSE people  and I did feel really bad about it. But we were starving  so we decided to order as quickly as possible and make it as easy as possible on the employees who wanted to leave so bad.   I fully expected them to be disgruntled that we walked in so close to closing time  who wouldn t be    but they were all smiling and excited to help us out on our first time    Bae got a brisket burrito on an ancho chile tortilla and I opted for chicken on cilantro tomatillo.  I usually ALWAYS get burrito bowls because I don t even like tortillas but I saw that they were making them fresh so I HAD to get one  Umm...I am still excited about making this decision. It was DELICIOUS and FRESH and ok  on to the next part.   Employees were awesome. They even hooked it up with Chips and Queso ON THE HOUSE because they felt bad we were leaving to eat elsewhere as they were closing up...we just went and ate on the benches outside.  Nothing about this place that isnt friendly  delicious  and awesome. 7 5 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,197,Same concept as Chipotle  but Cabo Bob s queso is much better.  Bob s cilantro lime rice is much better too.  You have four choices of tortillas here- all pressed and cooked in front of you.  The wait is long  so order ahead if possible.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,198,I ve been on the hunt for some good Baja fish tacos - fried  please  I ve got no love for grilled fish in a taco   amp  most of what I see on menus is grilled. These were good with a crisp cornmeal batter. Fresh cabbage  amp  crema. I had some of the mango pico added. Simple  amp  the price is right.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,199,More options than competitors Freebirds and Chipotle. Their buy six get one free punch card is a bargain if you go there with any regularity.  I like the cheddar tortilla with steak fajita.  The employees are always friendly considering how slammed this place always is. Be prepared to stand in line unless you order online ahead of time.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,200,First of all  yes  getting in and out of the Walmart Parking lot can be tough  but that s not the point  this is a Burrito stop and totally worth making the trip to. The food is Really tasty and delicious  The fresh tortillas made right in front of you are hard to resist. The rest of the meat  fish and veggie options are delicious too. Also  they don t skimp you in portions and are guaranteed to get a Heaping Burrito  Better be hungry   And Ask for a cup of Salsa Verde on the side and your set 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,201,I am trying to get over my crushed expectations in order to provide an objective review of my visit to Cabos Bob s.  I had high hopes for some authentic fish tacos and with such high praise on Yelp  I decided to make a run.  You can imagine my disappointment as I pulled into a newer shopping mall and found Cabos Bobs sitting behind a Starbucks - this is just your regular  run-of-the-mill Americanized and corporatized Mexican food.    Now - if that is what you are in the mood for - I don t want to discourage you from giving Bob a try.  I had a solid experience from the moment I walked in.  The seating area was clean  the workers friendly and helpful. The hot food was hot and the cold food was cold.    I ordered the taco trio and got to work trying to sample as much of the menu as I possibly could in one basket.  You have a choice of four soft shells - I chose the three flavored ones.  There is a choice of chicken  fish  beef  pork  and steak - I chose fish  beef  and pork.  All of the usual toppings round out the offerings.  All of the food was well-prepared if just a bit bland for what I was expecting.  An unexpected highlight of the trip was the cane sugar sodas that are available on the fountain - strong  vibrant flavors like ginger ale  root beer  vanilla cr me  and cola.  The cola was particularly amazing - give it a try and you will realize how bad Coke and Pepsi taste as they have become mere commodities trying to drive price out of their recipes.  The Mint Sweet Tea was also unexpectedly good.    You won t go wrong with Cabo Bob s  but it is also not an  experience 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,202,The  7 Best Beef Burrito is actually the best    The burrito was very filling and tasty. In addition  the beef was very tender and perfectly seasoned. They actually had really unique ingredients that I haven t seen before at burrito restaurants such as their smokey cheddar tortilla. This place might actually be better than Chipotle or Freebirds. I am already excited for my next visit 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,203,Crispy fish tacos  Xxtra hot sauce is not too hot  but very tasty   Cayenne hot  guacamole  mango salsa  and tortillas are cooked perfectly and each has a unique flavor. If you want really big  really good tacos and burritos  this is the place   D
Cabo Bob's Burritos,204,Can I just eat here all the time please ... I got a chicken taco with poblano  cilantro and sour cream on corn tortilla - plus some chips and guacamole. Mmmmmm.  Making the Homer Simpson face with drool      
Cabo Bob's Burritos,205,3 words. Smoked Cheddar Burrito  Simply the best and most fresh ingredients your heart could desire all wrapped up in your choice of home made tortillas. I personally love the smoked cheddar burrito because of the subtle undertones that compliment my veggies and fillings. The staff are helpful and are generous in toppings. I usually get all 3 of the beans and add grilled veggies with there many sauces. The burritos are huge and I often take it home for left overs. Sooooo good. You gotta try it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,206,It was really good  staff was efficient and friendly. I loved the mango salsa  it s the only thing that really sets them apart from Freebirds and Chipotle. which is a whole other review... lol 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,207,Love their tortillas. They press the dough and cook it in front of you. I love that you can build your own taco or burrito  and it comes with three tacos  so you can try chicken  brisket and pork on each tacos. So delicious. And so much food  Portions are huge.  I hope they have it plans to expand to North Austin 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,208,First time coming here  and it was pretty great to say the least  The line moved at a fair pace and i enjoyed the options for the burrito bowl. the employees were a little stale but the burrito made up for it  Will be coming back if i visit austin again
Cabo Bob's Burritos,209,Food was excellent  Customer service was lacking. It s great to give food fast  but when a new customer comes through the line and doesn t know how things run  please give them some friendly guidance. A reassuring smile goes a long way.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,210,Wow  this place is good   I ve been remiss in not mentioning how much I like this place after having had a couple of meals here a month or two ago.  Some of the most flavorful burritos and tacos I ve had in this state  almost enough to give Torchy s a run for their money.  If there s any nitpicks I have  it s that a  the different flavored tortillas are more a gimmick than anything else as they don t alter the flavor much if at all  and b  it s CROWDED in here during lunch  but that s evidence that they know how to make good food.  This place gets a 4  CTJ Scale  as noted below.  5 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing on after finishing a plate here. 4 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary. 3 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Joseph good. Would be OK having a beer here with Jesus  Dad. 2 out of 5 stars  Come-to-the-Apostles good. Meh. Wouldn t have my last supper here. 1 out of 5 stars  Come-to-Nobody good. I wouldn t have my penultimate supper here  either.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,211,Ehhh... This place was just okay. I was going to go to Freebirds  but according to other yelpers  Cabo Bob s is so much better so I took their advice and came here. When I showed up just before noon  the line was super long  but the employees were very efficient. The line moved quickly. I was impressed to see that they make their tortillas in house and they press them when you order.   I got a chicken burrito bowl. The ingredients were fresh but bland. The guacamole is just crushed avocados-no tomatoes  onions  cilantro or spices added. I love burritos and was excited to try something we don t have back home  but I think I ll stick with my tried and true Chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,212,Y all  I just have to say  this place never disappoints  With all the bad reviews that flood the internet  I just thought I would put a GOOD one up.  From their flavors  to their great prices  to their awesome chips  they won t break when you dip em    they re worth a try if you haven t been 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,213,I would come back. It s no free birds but it s good and different. Lots of veggie options.  They need one more north.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,214,Oh my word. Or shall I say world  Cause it s definitely been rocked  I usually get a burrito but a friend of mine suggested the fish tacos and boy  was it worth it. Get the deluxe. Also try their mint sweet tea  I use a lot of mint in my dishes and drinks and I believe they have a blend of Shiso mint leaves and southern sweet tea. If someone finds out. Lmk 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,215,Our office just moved to this part of Austin.  Stopped in with a co-worker who recommended it for lunch.  Could tell immediately that Cabo Bob s is a popular place to go.  The restaurant is styled after the Chipotle model but with much greater variety.  Loved my Baja fish tacos    And  pricing is very affordable which means I will go back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,216,I call in my order because this place is always packed at lunch. I eat here at least once a week. Chicken with Red Salsa  Beef Fajita with Tomatillo  or the Crispy Fish and Queso  all the bowls are excellent  They do great catering for my parties also.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,217,Let me first say that my rating is really a 3.5     but I m rounding down.   Cabo Bob s is an A-OK establishment. However  It s nothing I would go out of my way for. If I lived here  I would eat this place prob 2-3 times a week because of its convenience and price point  but this isn t a place I would take an out-of-towner to blow their taste buds away.   It s pretty much a step above Chipotle  which isn t a bad thing. I got a 1 2 Chicken 1 2 Pork burrito in a cheddar tortilla. Again  not bad at all. It was just a typical burrito  nothing more.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,218,Why are you reading reviews  Get in the car  drive to Bob s and order some tacos or burritos. You re still reading  Car  Bob s burittos  go  now  you won t be disappointed. My only regret  There is no Bob s across the street at home  on the other hand  I d be broke  even though Bob is reasonably priced. You re not still reading are you  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,219,Was looking for a quick dinner while in the area and spotted Cabo Bobs. It has the same concept as Chipotle where you go down the line picking which meats and veggies you want in your burrito  bowl  or salad. They also offer tacos and set bowls burritos to choose from. Some things I liked   1  they have 4 different tortillas to choose from and they roll it out and press them when you order  Neato. 2  they offer tilapia...haven t seen any other  fast food  burrito place offer fish  3  they have fresh jalapenos   4  BOTTLED MEXICAN COKE - you know it tastes so much better than regular coke. REAL CANE SUGAAAR 5  a variety of sauces salsas to toss on top. There s also a XX spicy sauce....it packs the heat.  If you re looking for a quick bite to eat that s delicious  stop in at Cabo Bobs 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,220,Average place. Many more burrito joints in town. I would recommend Freebirds. Food here is mediocre. I wanted fish tacos and while they have a number of option they fry the fish. WTF   Baja fish tacos should not be fried... I miss Wahoos.   Anyhow  it s sustenance and that s about all I can say. Average chain at best.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,221,I don t think I could like a  fast food  burrito and taco joint more than Cabo Bobs - at that s saying a lot.   I used to live and breath by Chipotle. Coming from the Midwest Chipotle was  it . The best. And then I moved to Austin  TX.   First  the meat is so freaking tender. Every bite - plus I love the spices they use. Also  they put a lot of meat in their burritos - and my favorite - the bowls. I mean a lot.   Second  the array of grilled vegetables - onions  zucchini and squash  and poblanos. The queso is top notch and the mango pico is what dreams are made of.   Third  the chips are perfect. Freshly made and crunchy. They also make their tortillas homemade AND made to order. There are choices too - buttermilk  ancho chili  cilantro tomatillo  cheddar  and corn.   Finally  the customer service has never let me down. They are always friendly and accommodating    I can t say enough good things about Cabo Bobs - the only suggestion for YOU - not the Bobs - is to be prepared for lines and don t let that turn you off. The lines are good - that means people are willing to wait because the food is that darn amazing 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,222,If you re coming here  make sure you haven t eaten in at least 24 hours. The burritos here are ENORMOUS and really delicious.   The coolest thing about this place is the fact they make your tortilla right in front of you. It s kinda like dinner and a show. The tortilla flavors are also really intriguing and taste great.  My one issue  and it s a very small issue  is that the burrito is almost too big. Once you pack all of these ingredients into the burrito you can never get a bite of everything at once  so you re left eating a bite of just chicken or one of just the vegetables. However  individually they taste great so I m really not too mad about it.   Also  if you come here make sure you get their homemade pepper sauces. They are absolutely delicious. I literally put it on every bite of my burrito. It had a nice heat and delicious flavor 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,223,This is just an update.   The manager promptly responded to my disappointed review and offered a refund and vouchers to try the place again. I live in Houston but I m looking forward to giving them another shot when I m in town again. That manager reaching out  will go a long way.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,224,So  yes  this place is one of the many Chipotle clones that have sprung up in recent years. Having said that  they re really good. They probably offer the biggest burrito I ve seen yet  and it was good. Not as spectacular as the original  but good. Certainly huge enough to be worth they price.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,225,I loved this place I got 3 tacos for under  10   such a great deal and everything in custom made   the line was long but they are super quick and friendly. I will definitely be visiting again soon.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,226,Been coming to this location for 4 yrs  At least twice a month  I love everything  The staff has always been nice and the place is very clean. On my way there now and why I m finally giving them 5 stars   Thank you for always delivering deliciousness   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,227,Love this place military discount is awesome    If you are looking for a good wait great healthy way to enjoy a burrito with all the fixings go to Cabo Bobs 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,228,I was blown away when I saw the giant press and turning stove for cooking the freshly pressed tortilla. Wow. The ingredients were fresh and I ordered straight from the menu without any changes. Makes chipotle seem like McDonald s. Burrito was amazing  tacos next time  salad bowl the time after. Awesome 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,229,This place was delicious. I went here with some co-workers for lunch. The line was long  but not ridiculously long as in out of the front door. Luckily  the line moved quickly. Cabo Bob s offers a variety of proteins  as well as vegetarian options such as salads.   What is really neat  is that they offer several flavors of homemade tortillas. There is a person making the tortillas fresh in front of you when you start at the ordering line. Flavors include ancho chile  cheddar tortilla  wheat tortilla  and a cilantro tomatillo tortilla. I did not try the flavored tortillas this time around  but I will in the future.   For lunch  I ate a crispy fish  bowl  with whatever toppings I wanted to mix in. I chose to mix in cilantro lime rice  cheese  lettuce  pico  salsa  cilantro  and jalepenos. The serving was generous  however  somehow I managed to eat it all  This is a great place for groups and I will be returning. The only reason I rated Cabo Bob s as 4 stars is due to my desire to see lower prices.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,230,Delicious food BUT the counter is so high that when my friend in a wheelchair rolled through the line  not one employee serving could see her. Every single one  6 of them  asked me what she wanted. Frankly  it was embarrassing. Even the employees seemed embarrassed. To get her order  they had to lean far over the food to see this young woman in her wheelchair. Great food  but people on wheelchairs need to be seen and visible.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,231,My husband and I stopped by Cabo Bobs for lunch on a Friday afternoon and loved it  We re not from Austin  but we will be visiting Cabo Bobs anytime we re in Austin and want some tacos    We both got tacos. Myself  the number 2  which are deluxe fish tacos. My husband  pork tacos. The fish tacos were perfectly crisp and the pork was flavorful. Also  the tortillas were delicious  Freshly pressed the second we ordered them.   Also  the sugar cane and bottled sodas were a plus  If I had to choose over Freebirds  Chipotle  or Bob s  I would definitely chose Bob s 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,232,I like to tell people that Cabo Bobs is the perfect blend of chipotle and freebirds... but with homemade tasting tortillas. Price is pretty competitive too   They have a setup similar to Chipotle. The walk through line and all. Fresh ingredients  a wide variety of meat  vegetable  and salsa options. One of the best parts of cabo bobs is there soda fountain. A large variety of pure cane sugar sodas  Also  they have their own very weird  but delicious salsas. Its like a happy mixture between bbq sauce and tabasco. But it works   Give this place a try  You will not be disappointed 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,233,Cabo Bob s Burritos... I have so many wonderful things to say  First  the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful    I have never eaten here before and it all looked so good so I was being really indecisive. The guy picked out three tacos and let me try one of each   A chicken  brisket  and fish. They were all sooo so good. My favorite was the fish taco but I really loved them all  I finished them so quick  They have fresh ingredients  great flavors  and the yummiest tortillas I ve ever had  They have a cute little outside patio with music and lights.. good little atmosphere    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,234,Oh hell yes  This place is legit.  It s a toss up between here and Freebirds. They are both equally good in my opinion  but different enough to add some variety.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,235,This rating is strictly based on my experience THAT day. The food and all are great  Delicious  no question about that.   Now I went there on Wednesday  8 21 19  in the evening for dinner. I had steak burrito and as I chewed my third or fourth bite  I felt something hard. I tried to put pressure on it with my teeth and it felt like plastic. So I removed it and what did I find  A piece of METAL. A METAL  I was very fortunate to not chomp hard to damage my teeth  pierce my mouth  worst...image if I swallow it  I came to the cashier and she called a manager  not sure if he is the manager but who else  . He asked me and I gestured that it was in my mouth and I removed it  I am Deaf  FYI . He handed me an order sheet and remade what I ordered. That s it.  One problem is he did not look surprised  shock  or worst...not even apologize  A piece of metal  come on  that is beyond serious. AND I still lost my money  haha . I should have taken pictures of it first but I  did tell my friends so that way they cannot accuse me of  lying .   I am very nervous to return to that place again. Clearly quality is not up to par...    Update    8 26 19  I emailed via Cabo Bob s comment card about the incident. I was contacted by the  General Manager  John Bimler  who was  awesome. In the end  he corrected the situation and I was satisfied. He gets 5 stars  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,236,10 10. Only thing that sucks is the long line during lunch hours. Everyone is friendly and the food is amazing
Cabo Bob's Burritos,237,Best burritos in town. No question about it. More people need to know that chain burrito places that I will not name are trash compared to the quality of ingredients Cabo Bobs. Starting with a far superior tortilla.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,238,Building your own fish tacos  it s basically like a chipotle   choose the type of seafood and add your own toppings  the food was amazing here  couldn t ask for anything more  they also have different kinds of tortillas like spinach  very beachy Hawaiian feel inside which is comforting and an awesome chill spot
Cabo Bob's Burritos,239,Delicious burrito with fresh made tortilla to order. That was the highlight  and the there was a cool vibe but most importantly the flavors were totally there. The queso is on point. This place is what Chipotle wishes it could be.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,240,We have ordered catering from Cabo Bobs  many times - they are always incredible   Timely  delicious  and such a great value for what they bring    Full-on deliciousness. We will keep ordering from Cabo Bobs for all our partying needs   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,241,We have been looking for a good fish taco place for a long time and just sort of stumbled across Cabo Bob s on our way home to New Braunfels.  Man oh man am I glad we made the choice to have lunch here.  I cannot say enough about the freshness of the food or the flavor.  I loved the fish tacos   I am so excited to see they are opening up a location in San Antonio.  Not nearly as far a drive as Austin  for a fish taco craving.  Open fast   please     
Cabo Bob's Burritos,242,Had business in Austin and my lady was hungry so we endured the God knows why it s so long chickfila drive through line to arrive at Cabo Bob s.  It was well worth the trouble   This is fresh food freshly prepared.  I watched as our tortillias were freshly prepared.  I couldn t pass up another chance to enjoy the  4 fish burrito and behind the make line I spotted my old friend Mark working hard chopping up chicken and steak for fajitas.  My lady was waiting outside at a comfortable table--the mounted fans and shade made the summer heat tolerable.  I even got a chance to say hi to Mark as he carried out a bag of trash and he helped us locate the least spicy BBQ sauce for my lady s brisket burrito.  Had to run to a 2PM Dr. s appt. that lasted over two hours but I retrieved my Cabo Bob s fish burrito as I sat in Austin traffic afterward. I munched happily as I slowly moved south on Manchac and the flavors of the fresh food filled my mouth and the empty spot in my stomach. Mmmmmmmm Good     I ll be back if God is willing.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,243,I have to first say I rate places on EVERYTHING not just the food. Customer Service goes a long ways. I stood in line for more than 5 minutes and never received a greeting or a welcome. I was rushed through the line and was unable to ask questions about the menu or different sauces.  They charge extra for queso on the burrito but it was more like colored water drizzled on top. They use a small piece of foil to wrap the burrito and the  queso  drips out. I asked for a bowl and the cashier made sure to explain they have foil and bowls are for those who order a bowl. I continued to ask for a bowl while the watery  queso  dripped down my arm. I finally got a bowl with a lid and other than the cashiers explanation I had no other friendly conversation with any of the workers.  The burrito was average  not much different from other burrito spots but for the price and distasteful service I would go elsewhere.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,244,So delicious   Get the fish tacos  They re made perfectly and the tortillas are extremely fresh
Cabo Bob's Burritos,245,I am beyond confused with all the good reviews.  The line was out the door and with all the good  reviews I was excited to try Cabo Bobs.  I love the idea of the fresh tortilla right as you order it  so theirs my one star.   The portions of food are huge for the price so that s cool  but I don t just want quantity  my burrito bowl was extremely bland and my husband burrito with  marinated  chicken was even blander  The guacamole was real avocado but zero seasoning  onion or lime and tiny for the price.    No way Cabo Bob  more like Cabo blah.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,246,Outstanding burritos I will be a regular now   The prices are just right too at 11 dollars with a drink . I recommend this burritos anytime.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,247,Before I post my review I want to just state that I m not a fan of Chipotle but I do like Qdoba  if that puts anything into perspective.   I would say this place is pretty good  I liked the different types of tortillas you can choose from  and the ingredients were incredibly fresh. I also liked their local made soda and fresh punch. Service was great and for a first timer they were patient enough to explain everything for me.   The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5  is the simple fact that I don t see this as a place you  MUST  try or even a place I crave. It s a good place for Mexican food loving friends  but it was just simply good  not great.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,248,We ordered 3 burritos for take out. two grilled chicken and one shrimp. All ingredients were fresh  but the flavor was less than impressive. The burritos left something to be desired.... as a person who has chomped down burritos from all over California and New York City... check out Texacana Cafe off Manchaca.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,249,Good place to get a burrito if your in the area. Has great choices to pick from. The burrito could be shared between two people. Customer service is not bad. There was no line to wait in. Overall not bad. Worth a try.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,250,I LOVE CABO BOBS BURRITOS    My boyfriend and I visited for the first time March 7 after our trip to the Domain we wanted something filling to eat without breaking the bank. I had this place bookmarked because I wanted to try the fish tacos I kept seeing in the photos.  I love the fact they make fresh flour tortillas classic and flavored in 3 different choices. I ordered the  3 Baja style on corn. I had it with everything it was suppose to come with. My boyfriend ordered the  1 which came on flour tortilla.   We were both extremely satisfied with the freshness  crunch  and flavors of the fish tacos. He said they were the best fish tacos he d ever had and I have to agree with him.  I REALLY HOPE AND PRAY they open a location in Houston because I will be the first person there to come support  but for now since Austin isn t too far away I will definitely be coming back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,251,Cabo bobs is the only place I m eating until the day I die. I have found what I love and I m letting it kill me.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,252,My Deluxe Fish Tacos were wonderful  could ve eaten two of the three of the Fish taco plate but also had the fries and the nachos.. next time I ll share..my niece s quesadilla was huge for a kid and looked sooo cheesy    Service was pretty fast and would definitely go again  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,253,I really enjoy coming here when I do. My experience everytime has been awesome everytime I come to eat. The staff is very friendly and work as a team to ensure they can get the customer served pretty quickly because as I mentioned in my previous update  it gets busy here during lunch time on the week days.   Today it was pretty busy earlier than usual. As the line kind of started to back up I noticed the employee preparing the tortillas help the staff who was putting the ingrediants you wanted in your meal while they were getting more food from the kitchen. That I admired for the team work they presented. They ensured your meal was filled correctly.  I like to order the bowls here but I have had a lot of other things on the menu. Like I said before this place is way better than Chipotle and Freebirds  The food tastes fresh everytime I have come here  Keep up the great work Cabo Bobs Burritos  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,254,Just passing through Austin and decided to stop at Cabo Bob s for the first time    I ordered a fish burrito. The cilantro tomatillo tortilla was spot on. I love how they prepare your tortillas. I definitely prefer their tortillas over Chipotle Freebird s. I would rate the overall burrito over Chipotle s though but not Freebird s  only because I felt like my burrito was lacking a bit of umph.   I wouldn t mind coming back and trying it out again though. The entire restaurant had a good vibe to it and there are many options to choose from.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,255,Delicious   I got the chicken bowl   Guacamole is exactly how I like it     I will be back for more   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,256,I finally made it to Cabo Bob s  and I wish I had stopped by sooner   I had the deluxe fish tacos.  It was very tasty and really hit the spot.  I enjoyed the variety of tortillas  and they were filled with quality ingredients.  I ll make it a point to stop again soon.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,257,Not a traditional Mexican burrito but preety good none the less. I recommend the ancho chile tortilla. I must say everything from the meat options to the veggies are great either a bowl  tacos or a burrito u wont be dissapointed always clean n a good deal for the price.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,258,My husband wanted to try this burrito joint after reading about it on this website   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Ffivethirtyeight.com 2Ftag 2Fcabo-bobs-burritos 2F amp s 65727de8e6970c17586b3f9788a86dffb88fad984b18a99b1b5bc53f6883243b  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  fivethirtyeight.com tag    a   So on our recent trip to Austin  we made it a priority to go. We were not disappointed  The freshly made tortillas take this Build-Your-Own Burrito place to the next level. They also have plenty of vegan vegetarian options  Yay   I ordered the tacos and tried three different kinds of their tortillas for each of my tacos  it was a good decision . I made some mistakes with my combos  so next time I ll know better  but even with mistakes it was still a delicious meal.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,259,Fresh tortillas made in front of you  The brisket  chips and guacamole  it all looked good though  Will definitely go back to try more things 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,260,My favorite guilty pleasure for tacos and queso. I have never had a bad taco at Cabo Bob s. It s all about the flavor tortillas. They come in flavors  my favorite is the cheddar. The ingredients are fresh and you watch the employees make your dish. It s always taste so good. The only negative is that you can t have Cabo Bob s on a Sunday  they are closed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,261,Veggie burrito was not very good- too many onions overpowered the whole taste  Fish tacos were not good either  food trucks in Austin are a better alternative imo
Cabo Bob's Burritos,262,This place blows any other burrito joint out of the water.  1. Can t wait till the next time I m back in Austin TX
Cabo Bob's Burritos,263,This is probably my favorite burrito place to go to. They have lots of different options to choose from including a brisket burrito   They have many different tortillas to pick from and their fish is my favorite.  Also  their staff is super sweet  The guy who helped me out last time was named JC and he was super friendly  They were really busy but JC took the time to ask me how my day was and he didn t make me feel rushed. Everyone was kind and my friend who went with me for the first time LOVED it   -D
Cabo Bob's Burritos,264,Great for a quick lunch... service was fast even though there was a line wrapped around the restaurant... I had the fish burrito and it was delicious but I added way to many jalape os and made it super spicy 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,265,Surprise of all surprises  Cabo Bob s caters   So my friend ordered a tray of fish tacos for like 20 people and I was shocked at the amount of food we were provided with. They gave us what must have been 60  tortillas  all 4 varieties  cilantro  buttermilk  cheddar  ancho chili   a small tray of shredded cabbage  a full tray of their awesome fish  perfectly salted  a quart of salsa pico  a container of cilantro  chopped onions and some chipotle creme sauce. And it tasted just like fresh Cabo Bob s  though the tortillas got a little not as awesome only because of the time wait .  They also threw in a free tray of their tortilla chips. Despite all my trips there  I ve never tried the chips  mostly because I get stuffed from the burrito by itself. But I must say without a doubt  they are the best chips I ve ever had in my life  clearly made in house  salted to perfection  thick and crisp. Goes perfect with their salsa pico and if they offered nachos  I m sure it d be amazing too.  What does Cabo not do 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,266,We really love Cabo Bobs  It s always very clean  the employees are super helpful and nice  and the food is always fresh  I ve eaten here maybe 4 times before writing a review but they are definitely deserving of a great one   Sometimes my 1 year old and I are driving and get hungry and I know when I come here  the employees are grabbing the high chair for me. They offer to fill my drink  get me napkins and just make sure I have a pleasant time even with a screaming baby lol. The cooks are always getting creative with me for off menu items like mixing up the tortillas to make different flavors  I love it here 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,267,Cabo Bob s has always been my favorite spot for oversized burritos  taco bowls etc.  over chipotle and freebirds. Very original  great taste and love the options of drinks  Nothing on this menu has been disappointing  I don t usually eat burritos but when I do  its Cabo bobs     Dont forget to try the guacamole and queso and the original sodas    Yum yum yum        This place gets very packed  but the wait is so worth it  if you need your order quick at lunch time I recommend you place your order online and pick it up at the register  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,268,Build your own or choose one from the menu like the  6 Brisket and Queso. Been coming here for several years and never disappointed.  Surfing decor with a Baja California theme  TV s and plenty of seating. Outdoor patio as well.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,269,My son  amp  I agree this is our FAVORITE restaurant. Their fish tacos are the BEST BEST BEST  And they have upscale sodas  if you don t consider that an oxymoron       
Cabo Bob's Burritos,270,Love this place    The tortillas homemade and come in 4 flavors  delicious. The ingredients top notch.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,271,What we got   3 fish tacos  You wouldn t expect this place to be as good as it is  but it is  We got the fish tacos  she ordered them on ancho tortillas  I got them on buttermilk tortillas  and they did not disappoint. Tons of flavor  Just like the rivals  you choose your type of tortilla  meat  and fillings. They offer a wide range of tortilla flavors but the buttermilk was amazing. I would recommend you choose that if its your first time. The service was fast and friendly too  Combine all that with a sub  20 total  for 2 people  and you got yourself a 5-star joint 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,272,Employees ALWAYS have a great attitude  they always create a great environment and makes guests feel welcome by engaging in conversation and maintaining a smile. The food is always fresh and tasty 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,273,Love the idea of having four different choices of tortilla  all prepared fresh in front of you to begin the assembly of your order. Beyond that  Cabo Bob s is pretty similar to many of the other chain or chain-like build-your-burrito places out there  e.g. Chipotle  Qdoba  etc . The fresh tortillas give this place an edge  for sure  but I have to say the meats here are slightly lacking in flavor. They re totally fine  but seem to be missing something...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,274,It was my first time visiting Cabo Bob s. I ve passed by the one near UT but I ve never been. It was overall a very nice experience. Employee by name J.C.  as stated on his name tag  gave me a brief run through on the menu and the different items I could get. JC also let me sample the different proteins which helped me get a better grasp of what I wanted to order. Cashier Shane offered a drink and finished things off. Overall and awesome experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,275,This place is awesome. Fresh food and great service Long lines during lunch hour but that is expected since it is affordable and great quality
Cabo Bob's Burritos,276,This is my favorite burrito place of all time.   They just do it right. Tortillas are prepared per order and they use a pool of  Big Green Egg  smokers to cook their meats.   Superior taste   quality when compared to places like Freebirds  Chipotle  etc  Excellent.   edit   Not only do they have the best burritos in town  but they have an unbelievable amount of respect for their customers. Hands down  the best spot for this type of food in Austin.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,277,My Favorite burritos. The tortillas are the best. I could eat here daily with the variety too
Cabo Bob's Burritos,278,Hit up the Brisket  amp  Queso burrito   Ba-BAMM  The combination is a Slam dunk for the burrito world  But dont get too excited b c the brisket isn t like Franklin s or La Barbeque.. What makes it Great is the sizeable portion of brisket  meat is tender not too fatty  more like slow cooked roast and the Queso isn t watered down nor makes a big mess...its Just the right consistency   They have lots of options besides just chicken or beef such as fish  pork  and a vegetarian option.  Lunchtime gets a little packed but is a great place to go regardless  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,279,This time I had the pulled pork tacos. OMG - mouth watering  I will definitely become a regular.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,280,Put in a to-go order since that s all you can do right now. Rice was severely undercooked  brisket was super greasy  like I could fill a shot glass with the grease falling out of this burrito  I couldn t eat the whole thing and then I preceded to get food poisoning. Been here a couple of times and this is the first time I have gotten sick. Spent my night on the toilet and throwing up. Won t be coming back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,281,The best burritos in the world. Iv probably been going to Bobs for 8 years or so and they have never disappointed. If you find a better burrito  especially in Austin  please let me know. The Staff is always nice. The food is always fresh The fountain drinks are unconventional and the atmosphere is great. What else do you need for a great restaurant 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,282,I ve eaten here several times and everything is delicious  There tortillas alone are worth the trip. Today I got fish tacos which are fried. I m sure they are about as healthy as the chipotle crema that put on top  but man are they tasty  My only complaint about this place is that the staff all has RBF. They scowl the whole time like they hate their life and or you.   I ordered online because I know that place is a zoo from 11 30-2. I got there about 3 minutes after my quoted pick up time and still had to wait an additional 7-8 minutes. The girls looked mad at me because my order wasn t ready. Too bad the food is so delicious  otherwise I d likely not return. So 4 stars specifically for the food. It s a fast food chain  so it s not like my whole  dining experience  was ruined based on the bad attitudes and mean mugs. Service and hospitality rating would be around 2 stars.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,283,Cabo Bobs over Chipotle any day.  I can t believe I didn t try Cabo Bob s until my junior year of college. This is probably one of my greatest regrets because their food is soooooooo good.  Setup is similar to Chipotle as it s like an assembly line and you tell the employees what you want. If you order a special  the recommended list of food on the left of the line   you tell them what number and they do everything for you. They make their tortillas in house and right in front of your eyes. Best tortillas ever  If you re in doubt on what to order  get the fish tacos. It s probably one of the best things i ve put in my mouth. Ingredients are always super fresh here.    They have a parking lot and parking is free  Hallelujah since they re located near west campus  a parking nightmare. Plenty of seating inside and outside. The only complaint is that they have those hard brown paper towels instead of napkins but if I m paying  7 for a meal  I can t really complain.   If Cabo Bob s moved closer to the university or the heart of west campus  they would probably knock Chipotle out of business.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,284,I love this place. The food is always fresh and delicious  The staff is great  There is one guy who is kind of a grump... He never smiles and is kind of rude  he wears glasses and is kinda tall  just ignore him. I come here all the time 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,285,I m lucky in that I get sent to Austin for work now and then.  When in town  I always stay near the airport as my office is in that area.  The very first time I visited Austin  I got off the plane starving but looking for something local.  My search brought me to Cabo Bob s.  I have visited every time that I ve gone to Austin since then.  Here is what keeps me coming back   1   It is very easy and quick to get to from my hotel. 2   The food is AMAZING.  The past two times I was here I got pork tacos and this time I went for a pork bowl - always so good. 3   You can spice it up as much as you d like.  I love spicy stuff so I always cover my food in the squirt bottles of their own special hot sauce that they have.  They also have a great green salsa and fresh jalapenos. 4   There are a ton of options.  There are several different types of meats  tortillas  veggies  and even beans to choose from.  You could come here every day and not get bored with what you ordered. 5   For the amount of food you get  really well priced.  As you can tell  I am a huge fan.  I m excited to come back to Austin in October and December to try something else on their menu 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,286,Good fresh and fast. Parking can be a little crazy because this plaza is always busy. This place reminds me of chipotle style restaurant. Super good will be coming back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,287,Listen. This is it. This is the realest deal for me. I will be here for lunch literally every day. The deluxe  2 fish tacos completely live up to the hype and it is amazing. It s a fair amount to eat for one individual for lunch so think about take out containers. But that incredibly crispy  battered fish  those amazing tortillas  please don t ask me to pick a favorite     the mango pico de gallo UFFF perfect perfect all year round lunch. The build your own burrito is a spiritual experience to say the least. Their portions are perfect - they don t encourage wasting but they really want you to be nourished  Try their bowls if you re trying to be healthy they are way more flavorful  fresh and flyyyy than chipotle bowls that s for sure.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,288,My opinion of Cabo Bob s has changed so I needed to update my review.    The food is still great quality  but the Dublin Dr Pepper is gone.      What has really changed my opinion is the business practices.  First  I learned that this is their only location  which is shocking because the decor and efficiency scream chain but they are just smooth as silk.  Secondly  they use many local ingredients and all of the sauce  salsas  and tortillas are all made in house.    I have now had the burritos  tacos  and salads and you cannot go wrong with any of these.  They don t use standard iceberg lettuce  instead using a green spring mix  also the fish is always fresh and delicious.  They seemed to have changed to a better cut of beef recently too but I cannot confirm that.  I am also a fan of the chicken as it is always tender pieces of all white chicken.    One of the things I had always been curious about was why there is a constant stream of firefighters  cops and EMS here.  Well it turns out they give a 50  discount to them and that is awesome in my book.  Combine that with the fact they take Hilltopper bucks and you can see how Cabo Bob s pays it forward.  Keep up the good work Cabo Bob s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,289,First of all do not go here unless you are super hungry. The burritos are HUGE. Loved that there was options for tortillas and loved it even more that it was freshly made in front of us.   Sadly they had run out of guacamole. And a Mexican restaurant without guacamole might as well be not open.   We ordered 2 of the vegetarian burritos and they were good. The cilantro lime rice was very nice.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,290,I stopped in after a long day driving while passing through TX and went with three tacos.  The counter service was both friendly and helpful as well as quick.  The pork and brisket were both juicy  tender and delicious.  I went with minimal toppings of onion and cilantro with the tomatillo sauce on corn tortillas.  The toppings were refreshingly fresh.  I was surprised at the overall quality as it looks like a chain restaurant and I was too hungry and tired to try another option. I would certainly go back again.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,291,We were passing to go to San Antonio  Yelp   where can we get fish tacos  this place popped up. Order some bija tacos and some burritos for the kids. If the kid can t wait to try the food then says  OMG      This is the best burrito I have ate   Then this place is good. Definitely coming back when I m Austin.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,292,Cabo bobs always comes THRU  Today I had an online order to pickup around 11. When I get there it hadn t been made yet  and they felt really bad. I didn t really care since I was 10 min early than the time on my pickup and they had a large catering order they were working on. The manager  I believe  handed me a cup and said  have a drink on me   That really made my day  So I get my drink and wait for my order. It comes out quickly  just 5 minutes later  and they gave me free chips and queso on top of my free drink for the  wait   It was my lucky day  Moments like these keep me coming back to cabo bobs every week     This place is BY FAR much better than chipotle or free birds. Especially since the ingredients are so fresh and the fish is so good    And their XXX sauce is awesome 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,293,Everything here is good. Just go. Skip Freebirds  skip Chipotle. Yes  I did say to skip Chipotle. You won t miss it  and you re missing out if you don t go to Cabo Bob s. So go.  Why aren t you there yet 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,294,My go-to place to eat in Austin. Inexpensive  quick  even during lunch when the line is near the door   fresh  and delicious. There s nothing on the menu that I don t like  though my usual order never changes much . They also have a super realistic punch card system-- free burrito bowl after six visits. I could probably fill up a card in a month without batting an eye.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,295,This place puts Chipotle and Freebirds to shame... it s that good   packed most of the time unless u get there early
Cabo Bob's Burritos,296,I m not a Chipotle girl. I believe authentic Mexican food can t come in the form of  Subway  style ordering. I thought I would hate this place for that very reason. But  instead of comparing this to  authentic   I took joy in the process of seeing my delicious burrito being made from start to finish. Starting with choosing my flavor of tortilla. Can t go wrong with the fish burrito. Customize it the way you want. Still hate Chipotle  but Bob now has my heart...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,297,I came in and everybody was super nice and the food was great it was fast it was out very quickly the price is a great for the amount of food that you get large variety of drinks and everybody in the staff is very nice and helpfully uj
Cabo Bob's Burritos,298,Cabo Bobs is great. A little packed during lunch but I suppose that is tribute to how good the food is there.  I like that they offer multiple tortilla types and the fish offering is interesting  and tasty   BUT I am disappointed they don t offer a steak item. I also find their salsa to be quite mild. For those two reasons Cabo Bobs gets docked a star but otherwise this is a good choice for a lunch outing if you don t mind a wait.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,299,I absolutely love Cabo bobs  So fresh and delicious  Chipotle can t even compare to the goodness you get at Cabo bobs 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,300,The burritos here were so good and huge  It had a similar feel and style as chipotle  but the food itself was way better  So many more options to choose from. I could only finish about 2 3 of my burrito and took the rest to go. I ate it cold for breakfast the next morning and it was still just as good  The sauces they have are so good and they have a ton to choose from 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,301,Cabo bobs is 100000 times of an upgrade for chipotle. Their different tortilla flavors are so tasty  You can never go wrong with their veggies and pulled pork  They have fresh jalape os which is a plus for me 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,302,Fantastic burritos  some of the best I ve ever had. But whatever you do  don t go here   Please don t   I really don t want to wait in a longer line.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,303,It was good  but other than the freshly made flavored tortillas  I really didn t see much difference between them and the other burrito places such as Chipotle  FreeBirds  and one other one in San Antonio that I can t recall the name of right now.  Don t go out of your way for this one y all.  Just go to the closest burrito place to you.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,304,Food was good but really don t see a difference between them and Chipotle. They give you a choice between a few different tortillas but my husband got the cooked cheddar and I got the cilantro tomatillo and I didn t taste a difference between the two.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,305,Did you know that you can place your order via their website so that when you arrive  you can skip the queue and head straight to the to-go  section  aka the register   There  you ll find your made-to-order food perfectly packaged and ready to go home with you. Thank you for nailing the customer service piece  Cabo Bob   gang 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,306,Finally got around to trying this spot after years of seeing St. Edwards folks eat and hearing the ads.  Glad I finally did.  Might have to give up other burritos and Mexican food.    Lots of people talk about the fish tacos here but I went for the  7 special.  Fajita beef  rice and beans  salsa  grilled onions  added some guac  smoky cheddar tortilla.  Amazing.  Huge burrito  you better come hungry.  The flavors and ingredients matched up well.  And  importantly to me  the burrito was mixed up inside.  It wasn t like most places where all the sour cream is concentrated on one part  all the guac on another.  Every bite was different.  And delicious.  And be sure to try out the flavors on the soda fountains.  All Dublin drinks.  The sweet peach soda is the best.  Not too sweet  definitely peach and a gorgeous pink color.  Was delightful.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,307,Amazing burritos and bowls. Plus queso. Plus Dublin fountain soda. What more do you need to know  I usually get the veggie burrito bowl but I have also tried the fish tacos and they re legit 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,308,Cabo Bob s is as colorful as Jenny L s hair. Now I could have gone with  Cabo Bob s is the Barley Swine of Chipotles  or  This place is a Freebird s Gone Wild  but using Jenny s hair seems much more colorful. Oh  c mon  it s more fun than saying  This restaurant is yummy.    The bottom line is Cabo Bob s is just another corporate assembly-line taco place  but I think their stuff tastes better. Don t take my word for the fish  amp  meat goo - and the word is apparently good - but if you re going to do veggie vegan at a taco venue  I don t know who s doing it better. I could literally flip a coin over the best deal here - the  10 ginormous 17-Veggie Bomb for  7  or the three-taco seasonal veggie basket you load with all the toppings for  6. Part of Cabo Bob s charm are the four kinds of tortillas  freshly pressed to order. Interesting stuff.   You know this place is a national franchise just waiting to happen  and it s cool they re based here in Austin. Their mantra of  No HFCS  in anything they have is clever  but I pretty much stick to iced tea in restaurants. So Dublin Dr. Pepper is now called  Doppelg nger   Whatevs. Incidentally  this intersection at Ben White and I-35 sucks  but I actually use the optometrist next door  there s a pedi place next to that where hip Yelpers groom themselves after a UYE  and that Murphy s across the parking lot is among the top-five lowest gas prices in town. It s easy to make an afternoon of Cabo Bob s. They re closed on Sundays  btw.  One anecdote  If it s crowded  and someone ahead of you suddenly puts in an extra order  they have to press new tortillas which will create some delay and confusion as this new order cuts its way through the assembly-line to catch up to the person. Keep an eye on your stuff  and make sure their stuff is not being accidentally put on yours. It s really not a big deal  the staff handles it nicely  and it was actually fun to watch - a kind of mesmerizing Three-card Tortilla Monte. We ll just call it another part of the Cabo Bob s charm.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,309,Cabo Bob s is sooo good   If you are looking for a casual amazing burritos with homemade tortillas def check it out  The food always taste fresh.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,310,This place kind of reminds me of a Baja-style Rudy s that followed a freebird to spring break in Rosarito Beach and got knocked up by Chipotle over Mexican Cokes  with rum  and nine months later  had a little Cabo Bob.   While there is no BBQ and gas station here  the line feels very Rudy s-esque with the iced down bottled drinks in in metal troughs while you stand in line  minus the booze    and the high fructose corn syrup   . They have the thing I always thought Rudy s should make a staple instead of white bread... tortillas. And these are not your grandma s tortillas. No siree...   The flour tortillas come in white  green  red and orange and they make them from scratch using only tree hugging ingredients like unbleached flour without all the extra junk  artificial flavors  colors  and things I cannot pronounce  added. The place them on a big rotating round griddle  flatten them and watch them bubble up as they cook. It looks like a landing pad of big and small tortilla UFOs.   - White   Buttermilk Flour Tortilla  - Green   Cilantro Tomatillo Flour Tortilla  - Red   Ancho Chili Flour Tortilla   - Orange   Smokey Cheddar Flour Tortilla that has cheddar and BBQ sauce mixed in.   They also offer corn tortillas  not sure they make them there  but they are non-genetically modified and made only with corn  no gluten added .   They have a variety of specials to choose from or you can build your own burritos  tacos  bowls and salads  choosing from a list of fillings  beef or chicken fajitas   shredded pork carnitas  crispy tilapia  shredded brisket or seasonal veggies. My only beef here is that the only fish offering is fried  think grilled my friends .   I ordered the Baja tacos  a plate of 3  but subbed one out for the pork so I could try it with the Ancho Chili tortilla. The fish tacos were served in the corn tortillas with a white crema sauce  cabbage  salsa  lime  cilantro and onions. I had them use the mango pico instead of the red salsa and easy on the cilantro and onions. They were tasty and each had 2 pieces of fish in them  but I would have preferred my fish grilled.   The shredded pork in my other taco was moist  but needed a little more zing in its flavor. The Ancho Chili tortilla was my favorite part of the meal.   I watched people ordering their burritos and walking out with big fat ones  but unfortunately for me  while all ingredients are healthy... those lack portion control and always leave me feeling way too full.   They have indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor  however are several picnic tables next to the parking lot and the view is of people going through a Starbucks drive through. Perhaps they could make that a little less open and put up a barrier.   Inside has a beachy decor and clever graphics.   I like that they are going for natural  healthy  not high fructose corn syrup tree hugging goodness here. I was alarmed that they do not offer recycling options for their glass bottles and plastic cups. I realize the city does not make it easy for businesses  but believe they need to carry this natural friend of the earth message through to the trash and recycling.   All in all  I would give them 3.5 stars. That is between A-OK and Yay  I m a fan. I am rounding up  because Jenny L. set up a UYE here  and she rocks stars 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,311,Cabo Bobs vs Chipotle.   Cabo bob s has its own special hot sauce. Chipotle has salmonella.  Cabo bob s has great big round tortillas of different flavors. Chipotle does not  that I know of .  Cabo bob s charges for guacamole. Wait. So does Chipotle.  Chipotle has beer. Cabo Bobs has an amazing soda selection.    Overall  I really like the meat selections and veggie selection at Cabo Bobs. Everything comes out warm and fresh. I am a fan of hot sauces  so I love the salsa and hot sauce variety. I usually go with the chicken bowl  filled with veggies and goodies    Verdict  Cabo Bobs is def. my place of choice. Unfortunately  due to convenience  I often go to Chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,312,You know what I like about Yelper Jenny L.  - She doesn t hate me to my face.  Mostly. - She actually responds when I speak to her.  That  and she usually responds in English. - She doesn t judge.  Well  except when I mismatch plaids and stripes. - She doesn t smoke such that I m downwind.  In exchange  I kindly repress flatulence. - She doesn t criticize me when I eat things in front of her.  Especially things that were once alive. - She organizes lots of cool UYE events.  Almost all of which I sign up for and never show to despite my best intentions  which has to piss her off.  Except today.  Jenny managed to find the one place in Austin out of the one-thousand-I-haven t-been-to-and-really-wanted-to-go-for-like-two-years-and-counting and held a UYE event in the middle of the day on a Saturday when I was  a  Awake b  Well c  Motivated d  Sociable e  In-town  So  to make it look good  I ordered the tacos filled with fried finned thingys that once dwelt in the sea  sorry  Jenny  that s as much as I can sanitize it .  The thingys were very not greasy  and not too batter-y  as I like it.  They were wrapped in wonderful  airy-light buttermilk tortillas  just enough to provide a good food seal but not filling in and of themselves.  Overstuffed with generous helpings of Chipotle Crema  Mango Pico  Shredded Cabbage  I don t think any of those items once sentient beings  so I will call them by name .  Hearty  yet delicious  meal.  You don t leave hungry here.  Be sure to discover the sauces early  and try the XX for sure as I discovered it only too late.  That happened right after I negotiated the hostage exchange between Jenny and Tiana for the XX sauce.  I felt so diplomatic.  I even took a hit off it while Jenny glared at me to get her sauce back.  It was all good.  Service was a little absent-minded at times  much like this review   but highly efficient.  They made up for it with their vast array of pure cane sugar sodas from Dublin Bottling.  I would have had a field day here  but I stopped after one refill  switching from Orange Tangerine to Vanilla Creme.  I will definitely be back to try the rest of the flavors.  But  enough about the food  lest you think this was all about the restaurant or something.  Back to the real point of this review  if there ever was one. - Jenny rules - Yelp rocks
Cabo Bob's Burritos,313,It s Lupe Tortilla quality for ten bucks. If you just want good food for a reasonable price. This is the spot for you.  The beef fajita burrito is the best in town. The fresh hot tortilla which comes in four options. Try them all 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,314,Do NOT eat  food poisoning in 18 minutes  After reading all the yelp reviews  I was intrigued. I ordered a pork burrito with cheese tortilla  added queso because of course  always add queso   standard veggies  salsa. I went back to my hotel  as I m visiting from out of town  ate half the burrito and felt really full and the burrito was REALLY good. I had already recommended it to my coworkers. 18 minutes in and I got the worst cramps I ve ever had and laid on the floor in agony before throwing up everything I had eaten. Even after throwing everything up  I still had agonizing cramps. I am known in my family for not throwing up  even to the point where doctors have given me medicine to induce vomiting and I still would not throw up. This burrito caused vomiting in 18 minutes. Not a great experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,315,4 stars for taste  5 stars for freshness and quantity.  Good value for fish  steak burritos  plus you get a frequent dining card.  Cops and firemen frequent this place a lot  so you know it s good.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,316,OMG so glad my coworkers introduced me to Cabo Bobs. I think I ve eaten there over 50 times in 2018  Food is so amazing    Service is great too
Cabo Bob's Burritos,317,Love Love Love   They make the meat in the green egg...gives it the best flavor.  This place puts Chipotle and Freebirds to absolute shame.  If you want a bomb burrito  bowl or salad...this is the spot   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,318,The food is absolutely amazing they give you plenty of food and I agree it s better than Chipotle  I love going here but the customer service is awful  no one is ever friendly they always want to rush you out of there and always have a straight face. It makes you feel you re doing something wrong. I ve came to this location many times and everyone is like this each time even though there s about 5 employees you speak to while you go through the line. I went to the one near UT once and every staff member was so friendly which made the experience so much better however it s not close to home.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,319,Always one of my favorite choices in Austin. The fresh made Tortillas are fabulous. Lots of choices for filling your burrito  bowl  tacos or salad
Cabo Bob's Burritos,320,I came into cabo bobs having a pretty crappy day until i stood face to face with a lady named Renee... Believe me when i tell you that this lady has an awesome sense of humor which really threw me off guard .i mean you dont really expect to laugh the whole time youre ordering food. I asked her if i was able to get double meat she replied and said sure u can get TRIPLE meat if you would like  and i DEFINITELY recommend the queso.what a way to UPSELL i mean for crying out like she probably couldve sold me her name tag thats how GOOOOOD she is. i even went home and told my friends about the great experience i had and begged them to come with me so they could meet this beautiful soul.. Im greatful because there arent many people who can turn a frown on my face upside down. RENEE YOU ROCK .
Cabo Bob's Burritos,321,Came in for tacos and haven t been here in a while as I get mad at the terribly lazy employees that work here. With that being said I am very upset that the manager slopped together my tacos in the worst way possible. I would have needed a shower to get clean after the disgusting tacos this man made for me. 3 times a week I would come now it s once every 2 weeks and now I probably won t come back. Get employees that care about their job 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,322,This place deserve more than 5 stars  it is very clean  healthy and very tasted at the same time. It is very easy to tell that they use very fresh ingredients
Cabo Bob's Burritos,323,One time review - normally I love this place  but today they gave me food poisoning. I noticed a funny smell in the tacos but dismissed it because I d never had problems here before. Recommend avoiding steak fajita meat for a bit after this review until they get new protein.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,324,The food is great. The staff is friendly with smiles on their faces. They re pretty fast too so if there s a line  it won t be too long.  They even have real sugar cane soft drinks.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,325,Excellent food  great customer service  for a good price. Similar to Chipotle but better. The tortillas are made fresh... like right in front of you. Then you load up your bowl  taco  or burrito with all the extras.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,326,On a scale of 1-10  I would say the food here is a solid 10. The only suggestion I can provide is the service is lacking the speed needed to accommodate a line of people. It took about 8-10 minutes of waiting to get through the line  when we re used to speedier service at a similar place like Chipotle. Fish is amazing though and well worth the wait  I love that Cabo Bob s offers a burrito card that they can punch through For every 6 burritos you buy  you get your 7th one for free  Very great deal if you go often. Will definitely be coming back regardless of the aforementioned problems.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,327,We loved this Mexican food we had it last night and we are thinking about going again tonight I definitely recommend this.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,328,I ve had freebirds. Chipotle. Costa Vida. Baja fresh.  El pollo loco. But this one surpasses them all and takes the cake   So so fresh and generous on their servings.  Your tortilla don t get made until you order it. And contain different flavors to boot.  Best fish tacos I ve had.  My daughter had brisket and that didn t disappoint eothetb.  Great staff and servers.  Wish they open one here in DFW
Cabo Bob's Burritos,329,Delicious fish tacos on fresh tortillas. We aren t from the area  we found this restaurant based on yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. Next time I d like to try the brisket and beef.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,330,Made a recent return visit to Cabo Bob s cuz it s been way too long since I ve had their awesome fish tacos. I love their flavored tortilla options  ordered a Taco Dinner which comes with three.    It s a similar set-up to other taco places  pick your dish and the tortilla  but here they press the tortilla right there for you as opposed to it already being prepared.  I went for the black beans   onions   cilantro   mango salsa  awesome     lettuce   diced jalapenos.  Not only did my 3 tacos look so awesome and appetizing  they tasted even better.  Add in a side of the chipotle sauce and I like to mix the hot and mild pepper sauces to get some nice heat.    Everything was excellent  and love their chips too.  Those flavored tortillas were superb  only wish they were a little more on the thicker side of things as sometimes the flavors of the taco overpower the taste of their thin tortilla.  I think the smokey cheddar is my favorite by far  so maybe next time I ll just upgrade to a burrito to get more tortilla.  Regardless  Cabo Bob s has best fish tacos in town - hands down.  It s a simple combination where freshness and quality are key  and I won t wait too long to come back for more.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,331,I ve been coming here for over a year now and What can I say about Cabo Bob s... It s simply one of the best places in Austin to grub    My first time here was when I went on my first date with my beautiful girlfriend  She truly picked the right spot for our first date to have food together. I remember my first bite I was blown away  the fish tacos and fish bowl is always superb  always fresh and crispy  the toppings are generous  the food is scrumptious and I ve never had a bad experience during and after eating here. I would also like to add that their Chicken Fajita is seasoned perfectly and I just can t enough of this place. Dr. BAJA will always hit the sweet spot. The Chips are super crispy and the red and green salsa is great.   Keep doing a fantastic job in delivering fresh  fast  and delicious Food Cabo Bob s   My girlfriend and I are customers for life  _ 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,332,Place is delicious. I always get three tacos and make them how I want. Blows Chipotle and Freebird s away. Get here and get here quick.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,333,Best burrito place in Austin   Most unique and fresh ingredients and super friendly employees   Great options for vegans   vegetarians and omnivores too 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,334,I m a big Tex Mex fan and like the regional and national chains. I loved this restaurant as an alternative.  The food  is great and the atmosphere is fun. You must check it out.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,335,Hard to beat this place.   The tacos are flavored just right  the burritos are enormous and the service is speedy and friendly.  Not thrilled with the crispiness of the flour tortillas  but that s a small whine compared to the flavor profiles goin on here.  And coupled with a cool assortment of cane sugar soft drinks  lookin  at you  cherry limeade    this is a fun treat that won t break the bank  but might stretch your stomach  - 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,336,Burritos are huge and made with fresh tortillas  you get to pick from several types . Food is tasty and good amount of food for the price. Downside is the choice or lack thereof  of fountain sodas. Many are  home made sodas  or you must buy sodas in the glass.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,337,What is Cabo Bob s  Now I finally know.  My co-worker recommended this place  quite a few times actually...and I never really believed him or ever gave this place a thought. Why  I have no idea  all taco suggestions should be welcomed with open arms and an open mind.  Is it like a Chipotle Qdoba Freebird  Some would say the strategy is a little  yes.  BUT THE FOOD ISN T. Buttermilk flour tortilla - yummers  And that isn t your only option for tortilla. I ve had the fish tacos and the chicken tacos. Both delicious. Tasty. Savory. Warm. Taco-licious. Generous serving  friendly service. The only thing I wish they had is corn but I can do without it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,338,The food in this place its amazing  Highly recommend it  they had different types of tortillas which are made to order  you heard it right  they cook your tortilla right in front of you. The ingredients are really fresh and flavors are amazing. Love the cheese sauce they put it on my burrito. I would totally go back multiple times if it was close to my house.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,339,This place is the reason I stopped going to Chipotle. It is everything Chipotle used to be but better. The tortillas are so delicious  I could eat them on their own. My only complaint is regarding the chicken  it really could be seasoned a bit more. Everything else about this place is awesome 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,340,I came here on a Friday night around 8 45pm  cutting it close I know . The food is fantastic but one employee  the first one I interacted with might I add  was rushing us to pick what we wanted  wasn t listening to any questions I had  and even had the nerve to make a clearly aggravated face at another employee when I wasn t ordering as fast as he wanted me too.  The second it hit 9 00pm they turned the lights off in the dining room even though there were still multiple tables still eating the food they had just gotten.  I ve worked in restaurants for the past 7 years fast food and full service and would never turn the lights off on a customer the second the restaurant closes.  Give it 15 minutes at least   Anyway  I ve been going to Cabo Bobs for years and this location today has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Hope this helps.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,341,Ok now I have to say that Cabo Bob s thumps its direct competitors mainly Chipotle.  How do they do this you ask.  2 words.  Fresh Tortillas  .. Not only fresh but 4 flavors are available for both tacos or burritos.  Flavored tortillas can really add additional flavor and these do.  The toppings are fresh as well as the salsa.  They also are good about not letting the meat sit and get cold especially the fish.  They are good about frying it in small batches so that is always fresh.  So to recap  Fresh Tortillas   fresh salsas  fresh toppings   One more thing.  Don t be scared of the line as they keep it moving even during the busiest of times.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,342,Can it be  Did I finally find an establishment not on the West Coast that serves fish tacos worth writing home about  Does this place serve only REAL sugar soda choices  Do they have an overwhelming amount of options that allows for hundreds of different creations  enticing me to eat here again  Is this place seriously only 10 minutes away from my home and work  Is their service really that friendly and quick  Was the restaurant clean  Do they make their own chips  Did I eat my fish tacos alarmingly fast  Was I shameless enough to steal a beef fajita taco from the 2 year old in our party  Am I still full from my 11 00 lunch throwdown 6 hours later   Ladies and gentleman  the answer to all of these questions is YES. 4 and a half stars and 216 reviews ain t lying. Stop reading  and indulge.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,343,This place is probably taken for granted. What more can you ask from a burrito with good portion sizes and fresh ingredients    I got the brisket burrito with the ancho chili tortilla and it was delicious. Compared to its competitors  rhymes with poopotle and poobirds   this place is better in my opinion.   Tip  it gets very busy during lunch time. Arrive early 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,344,The food here is great for a burrito taco bar.  Their brisket is tender and the fried fish is good.  The line takes awhile to go through  but it s expected.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,345,I always make it a must to stop by here when I m in the area. They are quick and the food is delicious. We always order chips and queso and are never disappointed.   I always get the bowl with steak or chicken  white rice  lettuce  cilantro  pico and cheese. My meal is always warm and is plenty for me to get full on.  I would highly recommend if you like burrito style cooking places like Chipotle or Torchy s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,346,Been curious about this place for awhile  several friends who lived south had mentioned it before. I had an excuse to visit to support WAP  Worker s Assistance Program  for a friend during Amplify Austin 2014 last year.  Yes I m a bit behind on my reviews.   Ordered the salad with half shredded pork   half chicken  wanted to try both   white rice  beans  pico de gallo  cheese and some sort of veggies I believe. It reminded me somewhat of Chipotle  but seemed a bit more expensive. It was definitely fresh  but I felt the flavor lacking more.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,347,I absolutely love this place. I started coming here when they first opened years ago  but now my trips are few and far between since I ve moved out of the state. I made it back to Texas in June and my first stop was Cabo Bob s  literally within 40 minutes of getting off the plane I was in the restaurant .   Pros  - Outstanding food quality and freshness. - Bold  refreshing flavors on the tacos and hearty  delicious flavors on the burritos  - They have a entire soda fountain stocked with pure cane sugar sodas - Homemade guacamole and fresh tortilla chips that they actually cut and fry right in front of you   Cons  - The lines can get very long during lunch hours. With one service line  you can end up waiting 20  minutes.  - They can be a little pricey. For tacos  a drink  and some chips  expect to spend close to  15-20.  MY FAVORITE   2 DELUXE FISH TACOS   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,348,The food is pretty good  but so not worth the wait   This place is SO unorganized that I called in and placed a pick up order  just to come in 30 minutes later and - not only had they not started it  but fixed the 6 other people s orders in the line first. Sorry  but not coming back here for a long time   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,349,Look  I like burrito assembly line lunch places as much as the next guy.  But this is in a whole other class  I regularly drive from my place of work in Westlake Hills and from my home in South Austin to eat here - both around 7 miles away.  The tortillas  meats  fish  vegetables  and salsas are all superior to any of their competitors. And yes  the fountain drinks and bottled sodas are the cane sugar variety.  My only complaints  1  There is not one close to my home or work and  2  They are not open Sundays.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,350,I would definitely choose this place over Chipotle or Freebirds  Bigger burritos at a cheaper price. The home made tortillas really make everything stand out above it s competitor  You won t regret eating here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,351,I ve been to Cabo Bob s a few times and while I don t hate it  I just don t love it either. Freebirds will always be number one in my heart  followed by Chipotle  and lastly Cabo Bob s. On my first trip I had the  2 delux fish taco meal which includes three tacos on three different tortillas - cilantro tomatillo  buttermilk  and ancho chile. Surprisingly I didn t taste much difference between them. Also the mango salsa pretty much overpowered all the other flavors. Sad face. The fish was crispy and cooked well though  so at least there s that.  The next time I did a create your own burrito on a cilantro tomatillo tortilla  slightly too hard   with chicken  dry   white rice  flavorless   pico  red salsa  cheese  sour cream  cilantro and jalape o. Maybe I just chose the wrong combination but I wasn t thrilled with my choice. I ended up dousing the burrito with a side of queso  which was not great on its own but better on the burrito.   Another thing CB s has going for them is their fountain soda selection. I might give them another shot but more than likely I ll drive an extra couple of miles to Freebirds.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,352,Been eating at Cabo Bob s for a few yeas now and it has always been my top burrito place in Austin  the service and quality of this place is top notch  THANK you also for not adding onions into the guac  I always do half steak half chicken burritos and it is always amazing. They cook the meats on a green egg grill and it makes the big difference 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,353,Excellent food  totally worth giving it a try  As you walk in you choose your flavor of tortilla and then follow it along as the other ingredients are being added. You can choose to omit or add items to your burrito.  My husband and I were satisfied with one burrito and my teenagers ate half of theirs  Prices range from  6-9 per burrito.  Oh their fountain drinks are a sweet surprise  flavors like cherry limeade  red creme soda and vintage cola 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,354,This place way better than any Chipotle  The homemade tortillas that they press and make as you order are pretty amazing  Lots of choices for you salads  burritos  nachos  tacos  and bowls   Try this place out you won t be disappointed. The line is long FYI 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,355,I m not really sure why the reviews for this place are so good. I went here the other day based on the reviews online when I was in the area. I had the fish tacos   and my S.O. got the veggie tacos. Don t get me wrong  there was absolutely nothing wrong with this place. However  I wasn t blown away either. They are better than Chipotle  but there are much better taco places in town. I guess maybe if I got the burrito  I would feel differently...   But for those wishing to eat awesome tacos  this place is just ok. I would DEFINITELY choose Torchy s instead if given the option.   The real critique I would have is that it s not authentic Tex-Mex. The flavors are just much to mild. I felt like I needed to douse my taco in Cholula  and that would have given it the spice it needed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,356,The burrito I had was amazing  I chose the bacon beef with a Smokey cheddar tortilla. It was one of the best burritos I have had in a long time. Also had the chips and queso. Both were perfect  Fun atmosphere with a Cool vibe. I ll definitely be back here on my next trip to Austin 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,357,After three years  John  the owner of Cabo Bob s  is still making a great product.  I ve tried pork  fish and beef in taco or burrito form. I ve tried brown rice  white rice  black beans  pinto beans  grilled onion  grilled poblano  grilled squash and zucchini  queso  pico de gallo  mango salsa  cilantro tortilla  ancho tortilla  cheddar tortilla  flour tortilla... they are all just so good   I can t wait until he opens his North Austin location.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,358,I had heard enough and had to try it out for myself ..  and I am in love. One  any restaurant that not only sells Dublin Dr Pepper  but goes to the point of putting it in a fountain machine  is awesome   Thank you Cabo Bob    The choices of tortilla flavors is really nice and that they make them right in front of you is great too. All the meat and ingredients are fresh and look great. The beef fajita meat - wow  I wish I could cook fajita meat like that at home. The flavor is great and so rich. Mmmm..  I got the three taco order and was more than pleasantly filled. Not too much  not too little  juuust right. The chipotle hot sauce was my only disapointment  was spicy hot  but almost like Tabasco and not like a spicy pepper sauce. But alas  Cabo Bob won me over. I definately will be back  and will try to always get tacos with my Dublin Dr Pepper.  9
Cabo Bob's Burritos,359,Cabo Bob s kind of has a one-up on all of the other burrito chains in town  coming from someone who also highly loves Chip tle and Fre birds . You really can t beat fresh made tortillas on the spot in four different flavors  ancho chile  what up  . The tortillas are the PERFECT amount of chewiness and charred well.   Dare I also say that their cilantro lime rice is probably the best out of all three  I m really not sure what kind of juices they put in all of their stuff  but I love the fish tacos and burritos and found myself eating every last bit of them even when I was stuffed to the max. That is dedication  or just a very  very strategic recipe .   Don t get me started on the chips. Ok I already started  but their chips kind of rock. XOXO Cabo s  see you soon.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,360,I had a dismal first experience at Cabo Bob s  and then concluded after reading 742 5-star reviews  that it must have been my fault.  So  after 2 years  I returned for another attempt.  The verdict  I m not there yet  but I see the potential.  The problem  there are a million options  and the ones that sound good to me end up tasting foul or not playing well with others.  And I have never had this problem  anywhere  including my own kitchen.  Lesson 1  more is not better when it comes to flavored tortillas.    I tried the ancho chili first.  No bueno.  Last time  I tried  but couldn t resist the cheddar.  Another mistake  albeit a better one.  They both tasted muddled  burnt  and slightly bitter.  Buttermilk has got to be the answer.    Lesson 2  maybe try tacos  The burrito worked on paper.  It almost worked in my mouth.  I blame Cabo Bob s for using muddled and conflicting flavors at low levels.  If you re trying to produce big flavor  you re liable to get cacophany.  Conclusion - the burrito is a hot mess.  Lesson 3  try fish tacos  I m going to start over  throw out the burrito  though I think I was almost onto something  and just do the dang fish tacos.   Lesson 4  do some homework  With the unhelpful mass herding by unenthusiastic employees through an option-rich assembly line of ingredients  I know I m missing key stuff.  Specifically  I felt as if there were a sauce missing that would tie the whole burrito together.  Now that I ve seen the online menu  I see there are all manner of tasty sauces to choose from.  The sauces are seriously under-presented at the restaurant.  I didn t have a clue what was available.  Now I m ready.  I m coming back with a vengeance.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,361,What you need to know - the food better than Freebird s.  What you won t like - the people  atmosphere and overall  attitude  of Freebird s is missing.  You start by selecting a tortilla flavor - seconds later a ball of raw dough is placed on some sort of flattening device and your raw tortilla is placed on a rotating hot plate. A couple rotations and a flip and you re ready to fill it with smoked goodness. Smoked  Yes  If you look back in the kitchen you ll find 2  Big Green Eggs  - ceramic kamado ovens that slow cook the meats and don t allow for any moisture or flavor to escape. The rest of the process should be familiar although it looks like they use a cilantro lime rice a la Chipotle and offer an assortment of sauces at the end. To drink you ll find  Dublin  Dr. Pepper  made w  cane sugar  on tap which is only one of a very solid assortment of self serve beverages.  The little ignorable aggravation is that because of the large tortilla cooker  the rest of the line is a bit cramped and certainly doesn t flow as well as other burrito joints.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,362,I ve said it once and I ll say it again  Cabo Bob s has some of the best fish tacos I ve ever had. So many options to customize your order  it s ridiculous - but they don t loose the quality or flavor of anything by giving you so many options.  Start with choosing your tortilla  which you get to choose  or mix  amp  match if you re getting an order of tacos which comes with 3   Buttermilk  Ancho Chili  Cilantro Tomatillo or Smoked Cheddar.  Then  you get to choose what filling you want - my favorite being the crispy fish tacos because they aren t heavy but have great flavor or the chopped chicken  breast .  Brown rice  yes  a mexican grill has brown rice - pretty great  and makes me feel a tiiiny bit better  then of course you get 3 choices of beans to include.  Toppings are endless  salsas make you stop and think - because there are about 6-8 choices and even if you want them all  choose wisely. My favs are the fresh red and chipotle crema    The people who work there are also super nice and efficient  always working to get the line moving as quickly as possible  so don t let that line scare you .  So  if you want a delicious burrito  tacos or bowl made with fresh ingredients  skip the competitors and go to this local hot spot.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,363,It s ok.  Nothing to write home about.  There are much better places in Austin for tacos and burritos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,364,It s all about dem fresh-pressed tortillas  Love how they have several different doughs to choose from. Their crispy fish is amazing stuff and they don t skimp on the portions.  For those who care  they forgo the HFCS route and offer a wide variety of soda options all with natural sugar.  I m not a big soda drinker but I appreciate the  in my opinion  tastier and  healthier  option.  If they ever open a location in Houston I d never go back to Chipotle or Freebirds.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,365,I ve got to say this is probably one of the better Burrito places in Austin. Most places focus on tacos but this place is all about awesomeness in the form of tasty burritos. Lots of parking  good food  ample space in the restaurant. YUM 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,366,Plain and simple  this place is yummy  No need for a fancy review. Just go try this place.  Rule of thumb  Go for anything with fish in it   I ve had the fish tacos and a fish burrito. Both of them are pretty filling and taste pretty good.  The Smokey Cheddar tortilla seemed pretty legit. Start off with some rice  beans  meat  or fish   non-meats and cheese.. then add some lime  hot-sauce and a coke and there you have it  A work of art  Bon Appetit 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,367,I like that they use fresh tortillas  however  freshly made tortillas should taste awesome and my cilantro tortilla tasted like nothing maybe needed salt  and it was so thin that it could not hold all my veggie ingredients well..it was falling all over the place  and the girl in the assembly line looked at me weird when I asked her to cut it in half.  All in all  they are better than freebirds and Chipotle   not as good as authentic southern California burritos  but good if you like gringo burritos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,368,Their fried fish was absolutely delicious  We got the burrito bowls and they have a lot of topping and protein options. My husband got a burrito bowl with a double order of the fried fish and it was heaping  I got a bowl with the chopped brisket and it was pretty good. Overall  this place is pretty good.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,369,My new favorite Mexican fast food restaurant    It s like Chipotle on steroids. You start by choosing your tortilla dough. Yes  The tortillas are freshly made and they have 4 flavors  regular buttermilk  ancho Chile  cilantro tomatillo  and something cheddar  I think  . If you are the indecisive type   cough  ladies   you can choose from a number of specialties. If you want to DIY  you can choose from a variety of meats. Then they got all sorts of grilled veggies  rajas  calabacitas  and cebollas guisadas. The queso blanco is also an option and is amazing  Then you got your standard salsa bar  sour cream  cheese  etc. All for the same price as Chipotle  if not  cheaper. Had this place twice in a row and I will be coming here more often. This place will not disappoint 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,370,Delicious food and convenient location. Employees are helpful and friendly. Restaurant is clean and organized.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,371,Love this place.  Tortillas are fresh  ingredients are bomb  and it s definitely huge steps up on chipotle freebirds.  If you want a solid burrito  you can t go wrong with Bob s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,372,I ve heard about this place for a while  but I was always slightly skeptical.  After all  just how good can fish tacos be   The answer  my friend  is pretty freaking awesome.  You haven t had fish tacos until you ve had Cabo Bob s.  Got the deluxe baja fish tacos.  Three crunchy fish tacos on three different tortilla types.  The fish was fresh and crispy.  It didn t feel greasy or overfried at all.  They added a lot of slaw on top  which made the tacos pretty substantial.  The lime mixed with sauce was citrusy  refreshing  creamy goodness.  Absolutely perfect.  Let me say this - I had the unfortunate experience of going there on a night I had a painful canker sore.  Cabo Bob s made me want to eat through the pain and finish every single bite - even with the extra lime juice I added liberally to all my tacos.    I ll definitely be back   I want to say I ll try some of their other items  but the fish tacos are such a winner that I may never need to try anything else.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,373,Blows away anything by Freebirds  Chipotle  you name it. It s better here. Everything tastes so fresh. They have a large variety of tortillas. My favorite is the tomatillo. Just go and prepare to eat a lot. There s always a line at lunchtime but they move quickly and the service is great. Also they have cane sugar soda in the fountain. It s incredible stuff. You will be a convert to the religion of Cabo Bob s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,374,I ve been going there so many years - one of the first customers when it opened.  My husband and I loved it so much and we were scared it wouldn t make as it had so few customers.  What a contrast today - the line is always SO LONG no matter what time of day.  Always worth the wait   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,375,This was my first time visiting after seeing good reviews and it being short distance from my hotel during my Austin visit.   I had an awesome burrito big enough to share  but instead decided to save for leftovers. The tortillas are made in front of you  try the cheddar  and the other ingredients were also fresh. I had the shredded pork. Yum. The atmosphere was fun and casual and the staff were friendly.   It s convenient too - right off the interstate.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,376,Meh. I had never heard of this place  and when I went in and saw the menu  I was hoping for something at least similar to Freebirds. But no luck on that. The food was ok  not inspired  but ok. But my burrito was rolled so poorly and loosely that it basically fell apart after about three bites and was a big pile of ingredients in a foil wrapper  which was also coming apart in little pieces. My SILs tacos looked good though. I might try this spot again if need be  but I wouldn t do a burrito.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,377,Outstanding burrito--especially for a fast food place.  Portions are very large.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,378,I wish this burrito fast-service mini-chain would expand out of Texas. It was VERY good. Highly recommend it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,379,yeah.  Definitely one of the better lunch spots in the area  as well as one of the better burrito places around. Seeing them make every tortilla in front of you as well adds to the experience. It can get crowded though  I d recommend going a little early than normal lunch times. There s a good variety of meats and sauces  as well as easy options for eating low-carb paleo whatever the cool kids are calling it now.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,380,Love this place  Fresh  offer good variety  the brisket tacos are great  I love chipotle  but if you like that concept but with some variety - check this place out 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,381,Are you freaking kidding me  I will never eat anywhere else ever again.   OK that s an exaggeration  but holy ish this is crazy. I got the fish tacos  and I just never thought I d say this  but I liked the tortilla best. WHAT  everything inside this taco was incredible  fresh veggies  amp  salsas  amp  fish and STILL  I found myself saying  This tortilla is incredible   So that s a good thing.  My buds got burritos and assured me the same was true of theirs.   Right off the highway  and though I don t move to Austin until next week  I m glad this was my first Austin dining experience and I am sure to become a regular.  BONUS  Jumbo sized bottles of Mexican Coke which  if you know anything about me  I live for.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,382,I have been ordering at Cabo Bob s since they first opened. I either order the Smokey cheddar chicken burrito or the fish tacos. I do agree with other reviewers that it s better than Chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,383,This is hands down the BEST burrito place in town. I have been coming here since day 1  and will keep going until the doors close. which prob will never happen  b c they rock     I wrote a lengthy review  but then thought  why tell you what EVERYONE else told you  The food is great  tortillas are the bomb  everythings fresh  ect. Its broken recordish to keep gushing about it  so ill keep this short and just say EAT HERE and drink a Dublin Dr. P 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,384,These people have to be paying yelp a bunch of money to keep their reviews high   Simply no other explanation at this point.  I live near this place and have periodically stopped by hoping for delicious.  Not once has it come through.  Have had cold and bland tasting tacos and burritos every time with one exception.  The one time it wasn t bland it was still cold but not bland because the the fish taste dipped in salt.    The staff and atmosphere fit the same description as the food.  Really people   How exciting can choosing your own type of tortilla be  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,385,Cabo Bobs is a  make your own taco burrito bowl  fast food joint  but here s why it s better than the others   Variety- They have a big variety in their menu and toppings without being overwhelming. You can even choose from 4 different types of freshly made tortillas.   Fish Tacos- Cabo Bobs advertised their amazing fish tacos  so I had to order the  2 fish tacos plate from the pre-selected menu.  Fish tacos may undoubtedly be the best invention of all time  when done correctly. Cabo Bobs serves the perfect fish tacos with light  crispy  fried fish that is not too greasy  with cabbage and mango slaw toppings  and the perfect chipotle sauce on top. The  2 plate also includes 3 flavored tortillas and guacamole. Perfection. Don t even think about altering this delicious creation.   Value- For the menu  ingredients  and portions their prices are great  I dare you to not love this place 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,386,Love love love this place  Similar set up as Chipotle but omg is the menu 10x better  I love that you can choose different tortilla flavors. The fish tacos are amazing. I m definitely coming back to try other food on the menu  I highly recommend trying this place out 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,387,AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING  I am so glad I read all these great reviews and came to try it out today. First  they make fresh tortillas right in front of you and there are FOUR flavors....then you can pick your meat. I ordered the fish taco  which was divine  and then the pork and chicken tacos. Everyone says the rice is great  and it was. And the soda s made with real cane sugar - you must try the rootbeer  Wowza...Oh and three drinks and three lunch meals for  21  Wow  am I happy to be in Texas and not CA...can t beat these prices 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,388,These people couldn t understand what I wanted in English or Spanish. I forgive you  high schooler  just follow your fellow burrito wrapper s lead. Props for getting me through the line in less than ten minutes.   The burritos themselves were  A-OK . Nothing outstanding or remarkable to say  BE  5 BEST IN AUSTIN      Man  get that out of my face 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,389,It could be because I m a St. Edward s graduate that I have such a love for this place...whatever the reason  Cabo Bob s is hands down 100X better than competitors like Chipotle and Freebirds.  Two words my friends - Fish Burrito.  And don t you dare knock it until you ve tried it.  They have really fresh ingredients and the decor is really great.  They also have old-fashioned sodas   Where else can you find quality cream soda    NO WHERE.  That s where.  Their queso is also really great     Beware - if you go during peak hours be prepared to wait in line...it is soooo worth it though.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,390,This place is a hidden gem in South Austin...I wish there was more locations throughout Austin. I realize that the Mega-burrito offerings are vast here  but Cabo Bob s brings it in a good way. The one thing I love is the freshness of the tortilla  it s made in front of you as you wait. Second  the flavors  once again really fresh and innovative  I personally love the Ancho Chili  but have heard great things about the other offerings. The rest is in line with other places with one expection  the hot sauce that says hot  is really hot...careful. The sodas are a little wacky but the tea is perfect. The space is a little small and get really crowded during lunch..come a little early to avoid the rush. I really wish I could come over and over. By far  my favorite mega-buritto taco bar in Austin...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,391,Big fat delicious tacos. They make the tortillas fresh when you order and you can choose the flavor. Also They have so many employees in the assembly line that the line moves really quick even when it s full.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,392,Austin s best  fast  burrito joint you probably have never tried. I had the brisket queso option and I was mind blown with the flavor  the massive size and price.   Also  the tortillas alone are worth the trip. They actually press and grill a fresh dough ball for your burrito. None of this steam a nasty chalky flavored tortilla you get at Chipotle or Freebirds.   Hands down. The best  fast  burrito in Austin. Awesome dudes 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,393,The service was fast even for the size of the crowd. The staff was friendly and patient. The food was good and the options were plenty. I would definitely return. The tables were clean  even the outdoor area was clean.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,394,Best soda selection  all Dublin  real sugar   . The food is top notch  the fresh made-to-order tortillas set them apart. All the meats are flavorful  brisket and chicken are my favorites. Relatively cheap  under  10 usually.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,395,Got burritos for the family. Delicious. Even for picking up and taking home 45 minutes away. Still delicious. Food is almost always spot on and fresh. My kids LOVE  the green burrito   it always makes them smile.  Starting with the ingredients.  Oh boy do they matter    Elevation burger should take lessons  Anyhow.. Everything is so fresh and packed with flavor. Nothing I ve had there is lacking anything IMO. The beans are great...nice flavor... The rice.  Spot on. Love the cilantro rice..always.  Mixed veggies.. Squash onions and peppers...mmm delicious.  The cold toppings.. All fresh. Onions. Cilantro. Pico. Cheese. Sour cream. Avocado. Tomato. Lettuce. Wonderful.    Now the kicker.. The meat.. Holy mother of god.  They have good meat. And I mean that.. I m not a big meat person.. But boy I love their meat  And their standards. All natural meats.. Organic brown rice. Homemade salsas. Sodas with real sugar  I do not indulge in those but I m glad they have them as opposed to the garbage most other places sell .. You can do gluten if needed. Or vegaterian..even Vegan. There is something for everyone.. And I have since found out they have a punch card... Wahoo     If you haven t yet.   Give them a whirl. You will NOT be disappointed. I promise.    We don t eat here often.. But love it when we do. Thanks again for great food...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,396,I went in with my friend recently and jc was really nice and helped me out when I was unsure what to get
Cabo Bob's Burritos,397,Loved the tortilla but other than that there is nothing special about this place and the taste.. so bland both fish and meat..Needs more seasoning...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,398,The food is fresh and delicious.  The cilantro tortilla  made fresh in front of you  is my favorite for the burrito   Again  fresh and tasty and affordable. Didn t give 5 stars because the salsa lacks spice- if the red salsa  or green for that matter  had more flavor and heat  this would be the perfect spot for me   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,399,One of my favorite places in Austin  Their steak and fish tacos could rival any other taco in the city  hands down. The staff is always friendly and the managers are wonderful. Angie is the bomb and will take care of you for any parties or events  Check it out  you won t be disappointed 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,400,The insanely high review average of this place got me all excited and I had to go as soon as I found out about it  I live in North Austin..South Austin seems so far.... .   I left disappointed and realized  immediately  that I d choose Freebird s any day of the week. Here s why    On the pro side  - They home-make your tortilla  from dough  when you order - both tacos and burritos  all flavors - They have awesome real cane sugar sodas in their fountain machine  Why I wasn t all that pleased  - No nachos on the menu  Freebird s nachos are some of the best in the land  - The guac  while fresh  is super boring - And the worst thing.....when they make the burritos  they don t let the juices of the ingredients  i.e. beans  meat  drain from the slotted spoon. The extra juices go into the burrito  causing it to become massively soggy in the bottoms half AND shower your hands and arms  and maybe lap if you re not carefull  in beany  meaty runniness.  - Their pork isn t nearly as flavorful and tender as Freebird s  I realize I m in the minority  but I ll stick with Freebird s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,401,Wow  this was a random stop   Had a conference in Austin  near Bee Caves and thought I d stop by on the way to pick up some lunch... picked burritos because I wanted to redeem the FAIL that last night s Freebirds did  for the 3rd time . Never heard of this place but found it a strip mall near a Walmart.  Went it and noticed that the menu was not much different than Chipotle or Freebirds so ordering wasn t tough. Toughest part was picking the fresh homemade tortillas  Settled with the cilantro tomatillo but bet all the other ones were great too. Built the burrito just like I like it  beef fajita  white rice  pinto beans  lettuce  sour cream  cheese  gauc and pico. Extra pico. I was so happy with the way it looked  didn t even add any sauces to it.  Good  First bite in. The buttery freshness of the tortilla  WOW. This pretty much made my burrito. Don t wimp out and get the bowl  tortilla is a must   Not as good  How they charge extra for sour cream... gauc I d understand.  Other to note  I didn t try any of the hot sauces  next visit will definitely eat in and try them. Another thing was that they had a menu of themed burritos where they build it for you  not bad if you can t decide 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,402,This place is absolutely amazing. The highest quality of every single incredible ingredient  starting with their fresh tortillas. Easily one of the best fish tacos I have had  but I also really love the steak fajita tacos. There is always a crazy line  but you can call ahead and order  which saves time if you re in a hurry. And no matter how busy  they re in a larger shopping strip  so parking is never an issue. The owner is really kind and has greeted us multiple times just to check and make sure everything was great. Really kind staff otherwise as well. So basically  you have the Baja Surfer vibe which works well  combined with amazing service and ridiculously great food.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,403,Great place  Plenty of parking. Clean bathroom and interior. Friendly fast hard working staff. The burritos are big and great. The pop machine has all kinds of wonderful beverages. I recommend it to everyone
Cabo Bob's Burritos,404,I went during a busy Thursday lunch  and ordered the Fish Burrito on an Ancho Chile tortilla.   I was impressed that the tortillas were made fresh  but mine was overlooked and fell apart.   For the fish  it was nothing more than fried fish sticks which was very disappointing.   I ll come back  but I ll be sure to try something else.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,405,Now I know why the line is so long here  GREAT food  huge portions  and super reasonably priced. Loved it. A great menu full of options.  A must try when in south Austin.  Not sure I d go here for dinner  more of a quick lunch type atmosphere .
Cabo Bob's Burritos,406,The food here is great  The only reason I m not giving 5 stars is the service. The get so busy that they really rush you through the line  and it s also hard to hear them sometimes and so by the end of the line you may or may not have on your taco burrito what you wanted. The food is delicious though and I will be going back  just maybe at a slower time.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,407,I love this place. I ve been eating here since the grand opening way back when there was still cardboard covering the windows and it looked like an abandoned warehouse. Since then  the food is just as great as it s always been. And I like the people who work here too  many of whom havebeen working here for several years. The fact that folks continue to work there after many years speaks volumes about how management must treat employees  which is awesome.  In any case  the food here is delicious. From the freshly pressed tortillas  in differing flavors   to the tasty chips guacamole  to the real cane sugar soda fountain  Cabo Bob s does things right. I ve tried all of the meats  and I m partial to the steak  pork  and fish. The selection for toppings on the burritos tacos bowls are varied and should suit most any one s taste. And the XX hot sauce to finish with is perfect if you like a spicy kick   I could go on and on about Cabo Bob s  but I ll just admit that I can find no fault with it. I ve never had a bad meal there. This place is golden  baby.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,408,Wow. I m so impressed  Fresh tortilla  so tasty  They even have fish for toppings  I didn t get it though  I got chicken. Everything tasted so fresh  I m coming back and bringing my friends  Not a lot of us know about this place. I can t believe I never heard about this place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,409,The best burrito I have had. End of discussion.  The fish burrito was really really unbelievable.  They have several different types of tortillas to choose from  as well as really fresh and tasty ingredients.  I have also heard great things about their tacos as well.  Every time I come I say I will try something new but I just can t get myself to not order the Fish Burrito.  Also they have really good ice.  Thats a big win.    They are a great spot for a fast and delicious lunch or dinner.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,410,Cabo Bobs delivered exactly as advertised. Great food for cheap prices with sizable portions. I went with the beef brisket burrito and it was so tasty that I will undoubtedly be very torn the next time I visit Cabo Bobs. Do I stick with what I know is amazing or venture to try something else on their vast menu. I truly believe that no matter what I choose I will not be upset.  Everyone in my party really enjoyed their meal and the atmosphere is fun and lively even though it really is just a fast food place. If you haven t experienced Cabo Bobs yet you are missing out and you should remedy that immediately.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,411,Good food -- especially loved the chips and queso  Parking was difficult on a Saturday afternoon  but once we got inside there was plenty of seating and the line wasn t too bad.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,412,We are in town for the weekend and MAN is this place awesome  Huge burritos and super fresh and delicious ingredients. The house-made tortillas are awesome too   I will definitely be back next time I m in town 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,413,This place is great  Huge  7 dollar burritos and punch cards  buy 6 get one free . It is very similar to to chipotle  but with a few differences that make it stand above. First  they have a selection of tortillas that are made from dough and cooked in front of you.  They also have brisket and fish as meat options along with mango salsa and cabbage to make some killer fish tacos. Lastly  they make their own house hot sauce which I thought was really tasty. Idk if this is a chain yet  but it should be.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,414,This place is incredible   I ve ordered Cabo Bob s for big lunches for my clinics but I had never actually been into one. It s delicious   WAY better than Chipotle and Freebirds  So many more options to choose from including fish and tons of different grilled veggies.   Salads  burritos and tacos are HUGE  Everything is fresh and delicious.  The 66 Red Pepper Sauce is a crazy delicious topping that you don t need but want more of  per the two guys at the table next to me... they were right    Cool vibe inside  We need one of these North  Cheaper than the other chains. I would love to go to this place any day  any time  So Good 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,415,This is definitely the type of food u have to thank The Lord for. I ve eaten and I can t get up. The chipotle crema is alright  not much flavor. And the 66 red sauce is just alright too  kind of tastes like a BBQ sauce  pretty hot. But I can t talk Or type I m kinda full. Mango pico yes  flavor of mango isn t strong and the touch of cucumber is perfect. I was gonna get the bowl to save on carbs  but when u see them making it fresh right in front of you  you just have to get it. I guess this is what real tortillas are supposed to taste like  great texture. Although he kinda burned mine  oh well. Ok I m either gonna go take a long walk or go to sleep. This is the equivalent of eating a Ben  amp  Jerry s. Perfect for after a breakup where u just want to be numb lol.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,416,I have read reviews and have been wanting to stop by for months  but I m never on the southside. I got lucky and found myself in the area and decided to stop by.  The line looked very intimidating  to the door   but it went very fast. Actually  the line was long enough for me to finally decide what I wanted to eat when it was my turn to order.  I decided on the  6 Brisket  amp  Queso Burrito. My friend had the  2 Deluxe Fish Tacos. Both were very good and filling. We were both so stuffed we didn t finish our food.   Good size portions and good pricing.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,417,One of the things I miss the most about Austin is Cabo Bob s.   You can t really beat the tortillas  three different flavors  that you can combine into one   and they are made right in front of you. The ingredients are always really fresh and tasty.  I always get the  9 when I m there. The burritos are massive so I usually eat half of 3 4 of one and save the rest for dinner.   This location is pretty popular so the lines can get pretty long though they tend to move pretty fast. What really blows is the parking  you have a Starbucks  a chick-fil-a  and a Walmart near by so leaving the parking lot can be a total pain. But the food is totally worth it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,418,As other reviewers have stated Cabo Bob s is a solid option as an alternative to Chipotle and Freebirds  but on my visit the rice was crunchy  which was a total downer and led to me knocking a star off. I think the food is pretty solid otherwise and may try the place out again if in the area and in the mood for fast tex-mex.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,419,I don t usually write reviews but I was so impressed with this place that I decided it was worth writing about.  Let me preface this with  I m a huge fan of burrito s   Before I moved to Texas I was a huge chipotle fan and then I discovered Freebirds.  I d driven past this place for two years and had always wanted to check it out.  Today I went in for lunch and they asked me what kind of tortilla I wanted.  I chose the cilantro and to my surprise they pulled out a ball of dough and made the tortilla right in front of me from scratch.  Let me tell you it was the best damn tortilla I ve ever had on a burrito.  The chicken was your average better quality cooked chicken  the cooked peppers and saut ed onions though were a nice addition.  I added a few more things like sour cream  pico  lettuce  jalenos s  and some of their special Xxtra spicy Chipotle sauce.  It was a pretty big burrito almost the size of a Monster burrito from Freebirds.  They folded it so well that I was able to eat the entire thing without any sauce or pieces fall out of it onto my tray.  It turned out to be one of the best burritos I ve had since I moved here.  I really liked the Xxtra hot Chipotle sauce which added a nice touch but I wish it was a little hotter.  As a seasoned spicy foods fanatic I like my food hot hot hot.  For me it was maybe 5 10 hot.  Something with habanero s would have been an excellent addition.  All in all I definitely recommend this place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,420,Definitely enjoyed this place    First let me say  I have never really been exposed to Mexican food much being from New Orleans  but I definitely was ready to put on my sombrero and do a dance after I ate here      I had a fish taco with all the fixings and a veggie burrito on a fresh tomato basil tortilla that was just divine    Mind you I was SUUUPPPERRR stuffed  because my burrito was Ginormous  yes  ginormous  it s a word I coined and I use it often    To top everything off this place is super convenient  easy to get to  fast and great service  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,421,Its a great place for some nice burritos -- the cashier Alisha was super nice and I would recommend cabo to anyone
Cabo Bob's Burritos,422,Easily my favorite burrito place. I prefer it over Chipotle or Qdoba which are my other burrito experiences. Not a huge fan of the seafood motif on the walls  but the food was top notch.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,423,Used to love coming here. I had recommended this place to all my friends and coworkers. I was going here for years and had always received a military discount after showing my military ID card. Today  I was told that is not enough to get the discount and I to be in uniform in order to get it. I explained that I ve been coming here for years showing my military ID  but was still refused.  Too bad  I ll have to take my business somewhere else now.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,424,BEST build-your-own-burrito option in Austin   Different tortilla options  which are grilled to order  not just warmed on a press like other similar joints.  They also offer a menu of tried and true favorites if you re not in the mood to build your own.  Their chicken is smokey and they offer some great salsas to compliment your burrito  tacos  bowl  quesadilla or nachos.  Unlike Chipotle  they also have queso on their menu and I ve even seen them offer seasonal soups at times.  Highly recommended 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,425,I m tired of getting ripped off here. Customer service is terrible  the food is subpar and they have messed up my order every time I have visited. I have given them many opportunities to make it right and instead they blame me for their mistakes. I order a kids meal  I get charged a la carte items  more than a combo . I ask for corn tortillas  I get flour. It never fails. Chicken  Nah  I hate you so I ll give you steak and then charge you more. I came here to support local business but they obviously aren t treating their staff right since CHIPTOLE makes more eye contact than these zombies that work at Cabo Bobs on Ben White. I don t understand how this place has a following.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,426,Very good food. Very clean.  Way better than chipotle   They even have gatoraid and Dublin soft drinks.  The tortillas are made to order as well 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,427,This is one of my favorite places to eat. Soo fresh and delicious. The fish tacos are soo good  not too fishy and the brisket and queso tacos is something I definitely reccomend. The tortillas are made fresh everyday and right in front of you. What more could you ask for.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,428,Been going here weekly for years now  forgot to Yelp how good it was. You can get steak or chicken fajita meat or fish along with rice  beans  veggies  and typical burrito condiments like pico de gallo or mango pico. 5 stars for several reasons   Doesn t take long to order and get your food. Staff is always real friendly. Portions are huge if you want. I don t drink soda but they only carry the good sugar cane Dublin sodas  not the nasty corn syrup stuff. Buy 6 get 1 free punch cards. Super cheap for a huge amount of food.. A step above Chipotle or Freebird s in my opinion. Great place 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,429,Burritos here are giant. And when I say giant  I mean they are almost my face size. The price is also a good deal. The taste  however  isn t amazing. It s good as a quick meal  but you can t expect to have the best burrito here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,430,I usually order online and have never had a problem. Good burritos and good service every time.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,431,Everything I have tried has been AWESOME  Go early or expect a wait. The online order app is very user friendly and you can get in and out in no time at all.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,432,I m glad I checked yelp for lunch today  It s the only place I ve ever seen that makes your tortilla to order and I could taste it. The fish burrito was very yummy.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,433,This place is amazing  Great food. Great environment. Staff is super friendly.  They care about there food and you can see it when they make my tacos. Love love love   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,434,Happened to walk past looking for food and decided to give it a try. Delicious  My boyfriend says he still likes chipotle better but is different enough I would compare it more to a costa vida or cafe rio. More like a surfer version of chipotle. I recommend giving it a try. They also have a unique drink selection. Red cream soda as well as vanilla and sweet mint tea.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,435,Cabo Bob s  I was so excited to try this place.   What I like about this place 1  Easy  amp  plentiful parking in a lot right infront 2  Clean  amp  pretty fast 3  Service was great 4  Lots of different hot sauces 5  Great variety of healthy toppings Sauteed Poblano Peppers  Saut ed Onion  Saut ed Zucchini  Shredded Lettuce  MoJack Cheese  Pico de Gallo  Chopped Onion  Cilantro  Sour Cream  Diced Fresh Jalapenos  Mango Pico  Shredded Cabbage 6  Freshly made tortillas  right infront of you  in 4 different flavors  Ancho Chili  Cheddar  Cilantro  or Buttermilk 7  unique sodas  What I Got   Pork Burrito- Brisket  Cilantro Rice  Baja Beans  Sauteed Onions  amp  Peppers  Queso  Pico  Jalapenos  Sauteed zucchini  Lettuce  Cilantro  Sour Cream   amp  66 Red Sauce  6.50  And I wish I could give a 5 star review...It was definitely a quality burrito... and probably would be a great option for vegetarians since they have such awesome toppings... but honestly  I think it taste-wise  it was just OK. I personally still prefer Chipotle s meat  amp  seasonings in their rice  amp  toppings.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,436,VERY similar to Chipotle  except that they don t have barbacoa  Cabo Bob s has more options  seems a bit more fresh and they have different kinds of tortilla . There always seems to be a long line whenever I ve been there  but the lines moves quickly. I m craving it as I type this  If you like Chipotle  you ll love this place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,437,I love me some Cabo Bob s. I don t know if the owners discuss promoters or detractors  I know i do in my business  but I am definitely a promoter. Super fresh and basic. No added or unneeded ingredients. There isn t a better tortilla out there  I get there right at 11am to avoid the line but if there is one  it s totally worth the wait. It can be pricy but I always add chips  guac and a drink. It comes out to about  13 but for what and how much you get  that s really not bad. Keep it up and please add like 10 locations so I don t have to drive as far  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,438,I ve always been a chipotle kind of person but this place... let me tell you. I love the atmosphere  even though it is sometimes backed up you have this care free vibe that makes the wait worth it  The servers don t make you feel rushed even though they know it ll be nonstop. Now to the most important review. I always like to get something different and that has never failed me. Every time I think it can t get any better it does. Meat is always cooked perfectly and they have the best tortillas   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,439,My husband eats here literally 3x per week. He says ordering online is the way to go if you don t like standing in line at lunch. Delicious  amp  dare I say  better than Freebirds 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,440,Fish Tacos   They are amazing I ve only had this at Cabo s but I love them that much  I ll stop by every chance I get just for those tacos  so if you love fish i highly recommend these 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,441,This place is basically Chipotle. I got the fish tacos and the fish is sooooo gross  it tastes like dirt. Not good quality at all. Better stick to Torchy s    But I guess it is what it is. I just expected better with all the raving Yelp reviews... when am I going to stop trusting Yelp  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,442,Seriously love this place  Is it authentic Mexican  No. But is it an upgrade from Chipotle and Qdoba and other giant burrito chains  Absolutely   Their tortillas are to die for. Freshly made  chewy  and do a great job of holding up to the food.  I ve tried almost all of the meat options and love all of them  and they have more options for rice  beans  veggies  etc. than other chains.  They also make huge tacos and burritos so it s super filling and a great value. The tacos are almost too big - they include rice and beans which lots of places put on the side. I was actually surprised that one of my saucier tacos didn t completely fall apart.  They do catering  most of my meals have been when they ve catered work lunches  and the spread has always been great.  Be prepared for a long line at lunch - consider ordering ahead through their website though and your food will be ready to pick up in under 20 minutes 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,443,Cabo Bobs does not skimp on the portions. Their Just Fish Tacos are wonderful. Two thumbs up  They made them super fast  too 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,444,Best burritos in town  and the staff is always friendly. Tonight I came in after close without realizing they were trying to shut down the restaurant. The manager was incredibly kind  prompt  and helpful in putting together our order while not making me feel rushed. As a service industry worker  I love seeing good service even at the end of the night  and this place is definitely on top of their customer service.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,445,This is my third time back to cabo bob s and it was delicious every single time   I can only review the nacho s for now...maybe one time I ll get something else but for now I can t seem to stop craving those nachos    The chips are freshly made in the restaurant and you can choose your meat and toppings.FYI the queso sauce is to die for    The meat is seasoned very well  Today I got extra fajita beef and extra queso sauce and was in heaven  I m visiting until but I guarantee I ll be back at least twice before I leave    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,446,The amazing service combined with killer food makes this place a 5 star experience every time. A million times better than chipotle 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,447,In Austin and really didn t want to eat chain but we didn t have a lot of time and yelp was very positive about it  at least at this location.  To be fair I would prefer to eat a few things before reviewing but it is very unlikely that will happen so the review is on one menu item.  The fish tacos.  Quite good but not outstanding.  I do really like the soft shells were pressed and warmed right in front of me.  Price was also very reasonable.  Good choice for quick and affordable fast food with a Chipotle or Moe s chain model.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,448,The flavor was not good. The service was great but other than that the food was mediocre at best   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,449,This place is consistently good. I have gone there regularly for over two years now. The shopping center where it s located can get a little too crowded during the lunch rush  so I try to strategically plan my Cabo Bob visits before or after it. At the moment  I like this place better than Chipotle for their variety alone.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,450,Ok  I work near the Cabo Bob s on Ben White and have not been inclined to try it until recently.  I figure that since I LOVE another taco joint  why try one that is similar in  formula .  I was pleasantly surprised when this turned out to be quite different.  A very California vibe with  somewhat cheesy  surfer decor and not just one flour tortilla flavor but four     The fish tacos are something only a 5 yr old could love  I swear they put fish sticks on it  .  But when I tasted the pulled pork taco I was suddenly very happy to be at Bob s.  The briscuit taco was also delicious.  Queso is made with white cheese and very good.  I will stick to my fav  Chipotle  for the best chips and guacamole though. Bob s is pretty bland.  Lastly  if you are in need of some soda made with pure cane sugar they have multiple options.  The formerly dubbed  Dublin Dr. Pepper  is now called Baja but the taste is still delicious.  After two visits it is A-OK.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,451,Great Place. Our hotel is close and we stumbled upon Cabo Bob s and its excellent. Fish tacos were great as was the burrito bowl and queso.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,452, 2 Deluxe Fish Taco as you get a sample of all the tortillas  The fish is crispy and not soggy with it s light batter. A good quick lunch place with tasty choices.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,453,My favorite place for burritos    Always fresh and you can pick your ingredients. So yummy.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,454,I ve eaten a lot of fish tacos and most say these ads the best I ve had. Period. Get the combo that has the 3 diff tortillas. It s amazing   Will be back FO SHO   Don t 2nd guess coming here. Do it  you won t regret it   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,455,A burrito the size of a baby  And tastes just as delicious   Order the  10   Feed your entire family for a week.   OR feed Sally Struthers a mid-day snack.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,456,Really solid food and great folks. Stopped in for a quick bite and I wasn t disappointed. Great value  food is large for what you pay and high quality. Would definitely come back next time I m in the area 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,457,I can t seem to try anything besides the Just Fish Tacos. That mango salsa is so good. The last two times the fish has been a little too salty for me. I still eat it. If they could tone down the salt just a bit then the tacos would be perfection.  The line is often long  but it moves quickly. Somehow we always find a seat.   The tortillas are cooked right in front of you and they are so delicious.  The noise level is a bit high  but I believe that s to be expected in a place like this.   I like the HFCS free soda choices  but I usually just get the iced tea.   The only thing I don t like about Cabo Bob s is the terrible parking lot  Getting out of the parking lot requires a lot of patience and care. Between that and the fact it s clear across town from me  I don t go here too often. I would not be sad if a location opened up north.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,458,I would say these guys rank up there. The tortillas are ALL really good and made right in front of you  that is a huge plus. It was a bit busy and we went in super late   literally thirty minutes to closing  the staff was relaxed and polite. I tried three different tacos  the fish  the beef  and the chicken  all good. The burritos are massive and inexpensive for what they give.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,459,This was an excellent find  We were visiting Austin for the Holidays and looking for a quick place to eat. A search via yelp showed us this choice and we decided to try it out. We are so glad we did  They have all fresh ingredients and make their tortillas right there for each order. Good ambience  Great food and Excellent service  We went back thrice in the 1 week we were there. Definitely 5 stars    Will go back again when visiting Austin next.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,460,This is my first time eating here  and I was impressed with the menu and the fresh tortillas being made. I opted for a bowl with carnitas  white rice  tons of cilantro and the chipotle crema. The flavor of the food is good I was just a very disappointed in the temp. I expect the sour cream and guacamole to be cold but I would of like for the rice and carnitas to be hot. I would definitely try it again over Chipolte due to the fact that they serve cilantro.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,461,I always come here when I m craving a burrito  it never disappoints  They always have good seating in and out. I love Cabo Bobs 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,462,I ordered the Cabo Bob Chicken Bowl and it was awesome  i was visiting Austin and i came across this place on yelp. The customer service was great and the food is better than Chipotle. Living in Houston  i wish that this place was out there. i will be back in June  so it is a must that i go back. i might just try the burritos  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,463,First time coming here and we decided to try the deluxe fish and the brisket burrito. The brisket burrito is huge  the fish was very good and both were more than fullfilling. Happy Holidays
Cabo Bob's Burritos,464,My burrito was pretty messy but just as delicious. Got the Brisket and quest burrito. Was not disappointed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,465,Great great food. Simple menu but quality. Worth finding this hidden gem in Austin  It s on the south side of the street by other trucks if you need  help finding it   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,466,I don t live in Austin so was excited to try this place  I LOVED the fresh made tortillas and smoked cheddar flavor was my favorite. The fish tacos are super yummy and huge  I could have a whole meal with just one taco  The ones in LA seem to be so much smaller. I used to like Freebirds a lot but realized they were super salty and made me feel bloated after a meal. Cabo s wasn t overly salty  just the right amount of salt and flavor and I think the tortilla and the spicy sauce really separates them from the rest... Oh and I love that they have mango salsa  my fav. Def coming back if I get the chance 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,467,This place beats chipotle  free birds  and any other burrito place on taste hands down. They offer a huge variety of meats including chicken  steak  crispy fish  etc. I cannot stress how satisfying the burrito wrap is with four distinct and delicious varieties.  Finally  they offer old fashioned cane sugar filled soda s and a killer sweet mint tea. This is the first 5 star fast food-esque I have truly been to in many years.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,468,If Jimmy Buffet bought out chipotle or freebirds and remade it in his image  you d have Cabo Bob s. Staff was nice  place was clean  giant burrito was burritolicious- it just feels like more of the same. Not bad  but there are so many places like this it s hard to find anything that stands out as unique.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,469,Got a take out vegetarian burrito from here the other night and it was huge and delicious.  Most places hide the guacamole but I tasted it in every fresh bite.  The veggies and tortilla were all awesome. I will gladly return.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,470,I have been visiting this place ever since they opened and let me tell you that the quality  service and taste is still excellent.  I loooooove their buttermilk tortilla. Their burritos are chunky  very compact  BIG  lots of ingredients  not stingy at all  ingredients are always fresh. I love that they make the tortillas there.  Eventhough I m hooked to their burritos  I have also tried their fish tacos and it is excellent as well. This place has a five starts in all categories  fast  affordable  taste  quality  quantity  friendliness.  If you are in Austin  try this place. I highly recommended.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,471,The best burritos in town will not go anywhere else but here I am very satisfied with their service and their food will be returning again and will be recommending this place to anybody that comes my way   very clean and professional. The. Cheddar tortilla is the best I highly recommend it to anyone that has not yet been to Cabo Bob s. . Overall awesome location and environment.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,472,Easily the best custom burrito spot in all of Austin. Simply prepared food with a great variety of options on proteins  veggies  and sauces. This is all topped off by the handmade tortillas which are cooked right in front of you. Simply unbeatable 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,473,I am a loyal chipotle fan. Whenever someone says another place is better  it never is. However  Cabo Bob s  even as a fanboy of Chipotle  I will say it is much better than Chipotle or any other burrito place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,474,Chipotle or Freebirds would definitely be better if yesterday was your first time to eat there. The tortillas were fair at best and the chicken was bland. The rice was undercooked and they charged us for a to go container. With so many other Mexican restaurants in Austin there are better places to go.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,475,cabo bobs is so good. I love their queso and prefer their guac to other burrito chains bc it s simple. I love the variety of tortillas and beans and their protein is always good. today I got a fish bowl with baja beans  white rice  cheese and chipotle crema. so so yummy with queso and chips of course bc I m a proper Texan. the only thing about them that is not awesome is the parking lot  getting out of there is sometimes more than frustrating. but for cabo bobs you can be a bit patient.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,476,Cabo Bobs is the luxury version of chipotle. You can never go wrong grabbing a burrito chips and queso.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,477,After finding ourselves outside of the Long Center  we were hungry and looking for some place to eat.  I remembered that there was a fish taco place down South and we would never go there otherwise  it being a 30-minute trip both ways   so we ended up getting super lost trying to find Cabo Bob s.  This eatery is on the north side of 290 71 near 35  in the same complex as the Wal-Mart.  The parking lot is blindingly white  and the atmosphere outside is... well  it is concrete.  However  step into Cabo Bob s and the reggae-margaritaville soundtrack will have you transported.    We both ended up getting the fish tacos  albeit in different form.  I am allergic to mango and so needed to avoid the pico - which they were happy to do  but in case you have allergies be sure to watch the prep carefully so they don t put it on by accident.   I had a  noooooooo   moment there but it was quickly rectified.   Also got chips and queso  and all that good stuff.  The fish tacos were small pieces of tilapia - two per taco - in a crunchy cornmeal shell.  They were rather salty and medium-level fishy which was slightly disappointing.  The chips and queso were fine  everything was pretty much fine  and really salty .  Would I make the trip back   Only if I were going to San Marcos or New Braunfels and was hankering for a burrito.  Was it good for the area   Definitely.   The place was clean  the restrooms were clean  and the servers were as happy as you could be working indoors on a gorgeous Saturday.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,478,I am so addicted to the green salsa here it isn t even funny.  Like I get cravings for it and want to eat it almost all the time.  Other than the salsa  you seriously can t go wrong here. Everything is fresh  the tacos tortillas whatever you want is amazing. I also love their chips  because they re super crunchy and salty and mmmmmmm.   This place puts pretty much every other taco burrito joint to shame.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,479,Amazing tacos  Great sauces. Solid place to come crave your appetite. I will be back soon.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,480,Lest you assume this is a creepy corporate chain  I feel I should  mention the following details   1. First restaurant in the nation to be fructose corn syrup free. 2. Totally F-n local.  3. Organic brown rice 4. real tortillas.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,481,Try the fish tacos they are super awesomely good    The tortillas are super good and the ingredients are delicious.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,482,Very solid food that s fresh and well prepared. Very similar to Freebirds.  I had a brisket burrito. The meat was tender and not fatty. I prefer Torchy s brisket to this place but they were good - just not spectacular.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,483,Smaller than a breadbox  but bigger than a baby s arm...  ...is how I would describe the burritos here. Burrito means  little donkey  and that s what I felt like after eating here. These things are massive   go ahead  say it...you know you wanna  One burrito could have easily fed two normal people or at least be spread out over two meals. Not in my case. Yes...I ate...rather inhaled it in one sitting.   They have a black board with specials. Or you can do the custom route. Choose your tortilla  or option of tacos or bowl   then select your rice then your meat  hehe   next up are beans  then the standard filling options including pico  cheese  and a spicy tomatillo salsa. Imagine an assembly line a la Chipotle  but on steroids    My burrito is as follows...  Ancho chile tortilla  freshly pressed and toasted before your very eyes. Next up  cilantro rice with the option for brown rice. I went with baja beans  which as a blend of red  black  and pinto beans with garlic and onions. For my protein  I chose the crispy fish. Even after sitting in the burrito  it maintained it s crunch. They stuffed about 6 good sized  sticks  in the burrito. Not the minced stuff  either  I finished up with fresh pico  shredded cheese  and fresh tomatillo salsa. You can add guac for an additional fee. The flavors were bold and fresh. I don t know who this Bob fella is  but I can assure him...I ll be back 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,484,I write this review with two delicious fish tacos sitting at the bottom of my very happy stomach.  or  I did. I m finishing this review 2 days later   Cabo Bob s is set up much like Chipotle. You start by choosing your tortilla  choice of ancho chile  buttermilk  cilantro   then your rice  meat beans  veggies   toppings. What sets CB s a bar higher than Chipotle is the crispy fish option for the tacos and burritos. Seriously  AWESOME fish tacos. I got the Deluxe  the  2  which totaled out to be  8.65 including tax. A little pricey for fast food  but you get 3 PACKED tacos  so I feel like the price is very reasonable. Mango pico de gallo  big slop of guac. Yum. The quality tastes like something I would get at a sit-down restaurant. Fresh and flavorful.   Clean  fun interior. Tropical baja Cali decor. Ample seating.   Cool stuff  free wi-fi AND freshly pressed tortillas right in front of your eyes.  Bottom line  I M GONNA BE BACK FOR YOU  FISH TACOS. I gave one to a homeless dude on the way back from the restaurant. After all  everyone deserves a chance to eat some good food   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,485,You win  Cabo Bob s.  The guy who first introduced me to this place said something really cocky along the lines of  I hope you re ready to write your next 5 star review   and I ve been holding out on the review to spite him but I just can t hold it in any longer    FIVE STARS   I describe it to people this place as a tropical freebirds.  They re world-renowned for their fresh tortillas - you gotta try the smokey cheddar  It s a great place for any meal really  an economical dinner date  a casual lunch after paddle boarding on town lake  or post-game fuel for the entire little league team.  They have your usual chicken beef options but I m pretty addicted to the fried fish and mango salsa.    They have the charm and quality of a local joint with the consistency and execution you d see in a chain.  The staff here is always very friendly  I came here with Alex T. one time and we each got a single order of tacos...using 3 different taco shells...and 3 different fillings...and the staff laughed along with us the whole way through it   Love the counter service  self-serve beverage station  and outdoor seating.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,486,My husband is a regular and he FINALLY took me.  We went on a saturday and I have to say I just love the relaxed  beach  type atomosphere...never mind I am a Cali-Girl.  Spoke to one of the owners  super nice guy and they are LOCALS...gotta love that.....the photos of the kids surfng on the walls are actually one of the owners kids  nice touch.  The tort s are AWESOME...........seriously......crazy good.   I had the fish taco s and they are great all of the items to can choose to go on it are freshly prep d.  I love real tort s.....fresh rice...even organic if you are into that sort of thing oh and pure cane surgar only.     Super clean  even the bathrooms  .  Ya gotta check it out 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,487,As most people have said  this place is a solid four stars.   What stood out to me the most was the cane sugar sodas.  Jesus....there is such a difference.  So good.      Cabo Bob s reminds me of a Chipotle on their best day possible.  Their home made tortillas are very good  they don t kill you with rice and beans like the other comparable places  and the people working the counter actually looked like they had a soul.  The chips are delicious and it appears like they fry them fresh for every order..at least mine were.  I will definitely be back.  The chicken was great 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,488,Friend tried  and conquered  to convince me how awesome Cabo Bob s was compared to Chipotle and Freebirds... let s just say that if CB was on the UT campus  anything Tex and or Mex would fail because of CB.  Chipotle and Freebirds are both predictable  so if you like to expect the unexpected in the burrito assembly line world  here he is. It all begins and ends with the dough - Buttermilk Flour  Ancho Chili  fave   Cilantro Tomatillo  and Smokey Cheddar tortillas - all start as a risen round mound  then thrown onto a two-way sledgehammer-griddle-disc-mechanism  squashed flat a la Wile E Coyote  and finally tossed onto the toasting turntable. Go see it to believe it.  Now  everybody s CB virginity needs to be lost with the fish burrito  6 hunks of fried fish fillet  the Chipotle FB predictables  rice  beans  etc.   and then... real choices... a squash medley  MANGO pico  sauteed poblanos   MoJack  cheese  and it goes on and on...  Top it off with with some lime and CB hot sauce...and lose yourself.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,489,I returned to Bob s after 2 years away  and this time I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  Perhaps  it was because I went during the busy lunch hour on a weekend rather than right before closing time.  The food was definitely high turnover  so food had to be constantly made fresh.  There was about 15 staff just spittin  out tacos and burritos and sauteing veggies.  The pricing here is very reasonable.  It is in line with Chipotle prices  and I will list a few comparisons.  Pros  pro-Bob s   Cabo Bob s is local  and it offers only imperial sugar sodas.  CB has 4 unique tortilla choices  and they are pressed and grilled to order.  CB has fish as a choice.  Cons  pro-Chipotle    Chipotle has more flavor boldness in meat and salsa flavors.  Chipotle offers corn salsa... and I love corn.  CB does not offer guacamole as a vegetarian burrito option.  Between Chipotle and Cabo Bob s  neither is better than the other in my opinion.  I mean  who does not like a baby-sized burrito   But... we can all agree on one thing... no one likes paying  1.50 for a slap of guacamole  but it is all something we painfully do anyway... with pleasure.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,490,OK. I will start off by saying some of my dislike is because I never knew how to eat a large burrito. Ha Ha  Truth be told I didn t know you are supposed to keep the tin foil on and rip it as you eat closer to it. So Adam F and I went for lunch one day. I ordered the something or other with chicken and brown rice. It was ok but lacked the flavor that I am used to at Freebirds.   I tore the tin foil off and tried to eat it. It completely fell apart. I kept trying to put it back together but it kept falling all over the place. Suddenly I realized I had made a complete mess and what looked like a five year olds attempt at a salad. I ate about half of it but quite frankly I was embarrassed and didn t really like the flavors that much. I covered the rest with a knapkin and let Adam F finish his.  I decided to stick with tacos from freebirds since I am more comfortable with something smaller.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,491,Got to say I like this place. After perusing Yelp for a recommended palce to eat  I tried out Cabo Bob s. Simple menu  tacos  burritos  but they make the tortillas fresh with your order. And the ingredients were a step above Chipotle or Taco Cabana. I had 3 tacos - beef  fish  and pork  beef was my favorite . Lots of different salsas.   The fresh chips - fried up to order - were delish. The pure cane sugar fountain drinks were a BIG plus  and there s still Diet Coke for those with the crack-like addiction to Aspartame... . I think I still prefer Freebirds but I m definitely going back to Cabo Bob s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,492,Move over Chipotle and Freebirds  there s a new Burrito Boy in town and he s captured my foodie heart and soul. After a recommendation from a friend and a massive craving for fajitas  I was directed to this awesome place.  I didn t know what to expect  but loved how they already had choices you could pick and choose from. When you re ravenously hungry like I was  the last thing you want to do is sit there and decide what you want in your burrito  or bowl tacos . I simply walked up  opened my mouth and pointed to the inside of my empty mouth and they filled it with the  8  Chicken Bowl.  With guacamole  mango pico and chipotle crema... it was love at first taste. Definitely not something you ll find at your local Chipotle. Oh and hellooooo Homemade Tortillas  The chicken was cooked to perfection and the prices are unbeatable. Feeding a family of 3 for under  20 gets major kudos. Also  my five year old dislikes the kid meals at other places  but he gobbled up his chicken and cheese burrito. Any place that gets my kid to finish his meal deserves our patronage.  We ll definitely be coming back for more and more.  And more.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,493,Recently had the Veggie Burrito and let me tell you... thats some good stuff   I can t get over how huge the burritos are and how much is packed into them.  Easily could be enough for two people.  Of course I was in the middle of a bathroom remodel and hadnt eaten all day...so I was a fat ass and ate the whole thang   I m actually gonna up my stars to 5.  I usually receive 5 stars for really top end places  but the food is so good hear  that for a  fast food  place  it definitely deserves a 5 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,494,Cabo Bob s is pretty terrific.  When they first opened a couple of years ago I ordered the burritos until I realized I could only finish about 1 3 and started ordering the bowls.  This is quite a shame because the tortillas are home-made  right in front of your face under a large griddle.  You have different options as to what type of tortilla you want  buttermilk  ancho chili  cilantro tomatillo and smokey cheddar .  If you want you can also get tacos.  My favorite filling is their fajita steak meat.  All their meats are natural and the most popular selection is usually the fish taco.  They have my favorite fish tacos in Austin.  The toppings are widespread such as sauteed onions  peppers  mango pico  regular pico  poblano peppers  zucchini  even pinto  baja and black beans.  Of course they have cheeses  sauces and fresh lime too.  If you like soda you have many options.  All of their sodas are made with pure cane sugar and are all  vintage  labels like old school root beer  Big Red and Dublin Dr. Pepper.  They even have ice bins filled with Mexican coke in the glass bottles  along with Topo Chico and Jarritos.  I used to eat at Chipotle when I wanted this type of stuff but since Cabo Bob s opened this has been my staple.  The guys who own this place used to live in Baja and spent years fishing and surfing there.  The name Cabo Bob is a general tribute to the spirit of the free wheeling surfing dude.  Come and see what the fuss is about.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,495,I ve never eaten at Chipotle or Freebirds so I can t offer up any comparisons to the competition but lemme tell you this.  Fish burrito is the bomb     -The green egg grills are cool -The made-in-front-of-your-eyes tortillas are awesome -The soda fountain drinks are insanely neat -The employees were friendly and kind  The only bad thing I can even bring up is the parking lot.  It s not Cabo s fault  but be prepared for a cluster of cars waiting in line to leave.  They have a mighty good burrito  but not worth a lunch time headache.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,496,Sure  Cabo Bob s has a goofy name  is located in a shopping center and has the atmosphere of a chain restaurant  but they make some of the best Fish Tacos I ve ever had.  In addition  Cabo Bob s  I really hate saying   typing that name   is a strictly high-fructose corn syrup free environment. This means Dublin Dr. Pepper  and a variety of other tasty sodas  on tap. A loss for Big Soda  but a win for your taste buds   And of course  your individual tortillas are made to order  The process is novel and fun to watch but it s also proof of how fresh the food is.  For all of these reasons  it really makes me wish Cabo Bob s WAS a chain so I wouldn t have to travel out of my way to eat there.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,497,I tried Cabo Bob s for the first time today. I hadn t intended to go there  but the line where I d originally been headed was too long  so I thought I d give the place a try. I was pleasantly surprised. Rather than the typical chain restaurant I was expecting  Cabo Bob s is apparently locally owned and had some unique surprises.  First  the tortillas are made to order. I tried the chicken fajita burrito on a buttermilk flour tortilla. The burrito was quite tasty  though the chicken wasn t quite as flavorful as Chango s. Next time  I plan to try the pork burrito  as the pork looked promising.  For me  the best part was the soda fountain. I was very excited when I noticed that the fountain includes several sodas made with sugarcane  including sugarcane Dr. Pepper from Dublin  Tx  Considering that the tiny bottles of Dublin Dr. Pepper are somewhere around  1 at Central Market   1.69 for a self-serve fountain drink is a great deal.  I d love it if they added whole wheat tortillas to the menu  but I plan on going back regardless. And I will probably become a regular  for the Dr. Pepper alone.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,498,I m so glad  Cabo Bobs it s around the corner from my job. I treat myself every week for some deliciousness. I love everything they serve. Even there drinks are delicious. I m actually craving a spinach chicken burrito with que so and guacamole  oh and mango pico
Cabo Bob's Burritos,499,Large burritos.  The seasoning of the sauces could have been better.  Served luke warm.  Wait service was fast and efficient moist of the time.  Very noisy bar atmosphere.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,500,I first must indicate how much I love anything that has the word bob in it...BOB FM  The Bob haircut  so I had a feeling I would like this Cabo Bob idea....  and I was RIGHT   I went here yesterday because it is so close to my job and WOW it put the bob in the bob shoo bob do waa and the ram in the ramma lamma ding dong   I got the cheddar tortilla to start with  I ordered the burrito  which they are HUGE .  It was fun watching the tortillas spinning around and they are MADE FRESH.  This place is like an assembly line  so after you get your fresh tortilla you are guided through and get to pick what you want to  like Freebirds  and then you pay and then you move on.  A highlight of this place for me  aside from the SURF decor that I LOVE  was the AMAZING fountain drink area   Bobtastic    They have imperial sugar fountain drinks Dublin Dr. Pepper  an orange drink made with imperial sugar  all of the drinks were  a regular cola  a root beer  and a MARVELOUS imperial sugar lemonade that is the perfect balance of sweet and tart   This place was so crowded yesterday   It is a very casual place but is so very good  too    I will be ready to go back soon      I also really appreciated their Fuel For The Journey Motto  again a huge fan of JOURNEY  the band   they had going on in there  I found that to be not only accurate but highly appropriate 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,1,I love Cabo Bobs  I wish they would come up to Plano  but I used to go to Cabo Bob s in various locations around Austin 5 days a week for multiple years and my visits back to Austin are not the same without a burrito with a fresh pressed tortilla. Even with all of those visits  my enthusiasm has not wavered in the slightest and it s still one of my favorite places on earth. If I could have food from only one restaurant for the rest of my life  it would be Bobs.   This location has some tricky parking  but don t let that detour you if you haven t been 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,2,I love my Mecican food   This place is the Chipotle killer.  Anyone who goes to Chipotle instead of Cabo Bob s is on crack cocaine and has a limp tongue.  Better rice  better beans  better veggies - zucchini and squash   Ask Chipotle for zucchini and squash and their head might explode.  Poblano and Onions   Give me my veggies.  Aye Papi 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,3,Super yummy  flavorful tacos served in an efficient manner.  Convenient and easy on the wallet too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,4,We. Love. Cabo. Bob s   Do not let the long line  or lack of parking deter you - Cabo Bob s is a must   It is less than  10 for a build your own burrito or bowl  think Chipotle   and the portions are definitely filling. There is indoor and outdoor seating  dog friendly  and super nice employees - what more could you ask for  Hint - get some limes to squeeze over your burrito or bowl  it just adds an extra something special     Give Cabo Bob s a try - you will not regret it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,5,Just another version of chipotle with not as many options. Its over rated and over priced for the portion sizes. the QUESO is a HELL NO from this place. Its literally just melted velveta with no other flavor  I couldn t even eat it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,6,Came on a Monday evening. There was some parking up front but it looked like we snagged the last available one. It was crowded though there was space in the outdoor seating. Like what other yelpers have described this place  it s like a Chipotle 2.0 setup. They make their own tortillas in front of you  I got the brisket burrito with the cilantro tomatillos tortilla.  Ambiance  4 5 Very college dining fee Service  5 5 Despite the long line they were fast Food  5 5 It was absolutely delicious  The thing that sets it apart is the freshly made tortilla that you get to choose the batter and see them make in front of you. It was the perfect amount of chewiness  In addition to the brisket I included pablano peppers  onions  zucchini and other fillings. The chips were also amazing   Coming from NC  I wish they have one of these over there  I would definitely be a regular 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,7,I was craving trying their  build your own  bowl. The last time I ate here was four years ago  and I remember it being better than chipotle. Recently  I ve been hearing more about how great this place is.   My sister and boyfriend decided to take me here to try it again. The food was fresh and delicious. There is plenty of variety in both meat  tortillas  salsas  and veggies here. They offered local craft sodas  and the food came in a very large portion.   There was parking available. There was lots of indoor and outdoor seating  with fans for a hot day .   This place is worth a hype  Give a try 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,8,I love this place. The Baja fish tacos are as good as you re going to find in Austin and their portions are huge 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,9,Food  6 5 AMAZING MEXICAN FOOD  I have never had such good Mexican food in my life. They literally make the tortillas right in front of your face  and they even make different flavors of them  All the ingredients are super fresh and the meat is great    Service  4 5 All the staff wear gloves and masks. They are very friendly and diligent. They move fast  while making sure they don t mess up your order.   Quality  4 5 They have an outdoor and indoor dining area with nice chairs and tables. They sanitize the furniture between customers  and make sure they are clean.   Prices  4.5 5 Very reasonable prices  We got 5 tacos and a HUGE burrito for  27  It fed the three of us  The meats were all well balanced in prices and there is even a  double up  on the meat for a little bit more   Overall  18.5 20  If I m ever in Austin again  I will DEFINITELY come back here     
Cabo Bob's Burritos,10,For the price and the amount of food  cabo bobs is a new favorite.  As long as they don t change the way that they pile on the food  I ll be a loyal customer here. The flavors sometimes fall flat so you need to make sure to put a lot of sauce on but as long as you do that  it is a good meal     I like how you can make it healthy with all the veggies and additions and overall  it s a great experience.   Also the burrito handler wrapped my giant burrito like a boss... somehow no big leaks  which I wouldn t be able to do..  Just check out how big this burrito is 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,11,Huge burritos filled with plenty of food. I always get their crispy fish as my protein and it is amazing  highly recommend. Load up with plenty of food and enjoy  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,12,We had a fabulous lunch on our first visit to Cabo Bob s. The fish tacos were as amazing as all had said they were and would be at this location.  I loved the corn tortillas and the mango salsa as well as the chips and queso.  The manager  Edward was very kind and interested how we liked our lunch. I loved that he referred to us as guest and not customers  guest has a better connotation ring to it. We will be back... not tomorrow  but soon. Thanks for a pleasant lunch. Your guest Linda
Cabo Bob's Burritos,13,The best of the make your own burrito places. Fresh ingredients  lots of food  and the best tortillas and chips make Cabo Bob s a standout. Fast efficient service with plenty of staff to navigate all the offerings.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,14,I love chipotle - but then I had Cabo Bob s  WOW - it was so delicious   I m so glad that I decided to stop by. Everything tasted fresher      I decided to build my own burrito  amp  got Smokey Cheddar flavor as my choice of tortilla  amp  Shredded Pork as my choice of meat. It was really cool seeing them press the dough into a tortilla - that s when you know they make it fresh  The mango pico topping is life-changing - the cucumber in it balances the meat and cheese out.   The process was like chipotle  where you tell them what you want  amp  they add it in. I really like how they have a plastic divider with the choices on it  so you can just point what you want.   I hope they open one near Bee Cave so I don t have to drive 25 minutes  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,15,You can t go wrong with the ancho chile tortilla. All the tortillas are freshly grilled right in front of you  which lends to their perfect combo of warmth  fluffy-yet-grilled texture  and amazing taste.   The selection of ingredients is unique  roasted poblanos  squash  grilled onions  and flavorful. The excellent quality of the food here is consistent and served with a friendly smile.   There s a sizeable  covered outdoor eating space with fans that s perfect for enjoying outdoor dining.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,16,One of our most visited restaurants in Austin    This is a staple for us  I ve only ever gotten the fish tacos and that s never gonna change  The fish feels crunchy and light. It s seriously perfect. The portions are generous and the tortillas are made in house  I get one buttermilk tortilla and two ancho chili tortillas.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,17,It s often packed with students  and the crowds make the wait long but you can t beat a fresh made tortilla. They let you mix flavors  so your tortilla can be a hybrid if you want. I do a veggie burrito with mango pico. They have a punch card rewards system.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,18,Love this place  professional and speedy. Great flavors and amazing portion sizes compared to others.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,19,I don t know why it took me so long to discover this place  it s awesome    Perfect for catering parties at a reasonable price too. Highly recommend this place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,20,There is a reason why this place is constantly teeming with students.  I would say this Cabo is the superior version of Chipotle  worth walking the extra few blocks from campus.  You can t really go wrong with anything of their food options - though their burritos are legendary. Many meat options to choose from  would recommend their fried fish. And from there  the rest of their topping options are plentiful  I would recommend the baja beans and the mango pico    All the employees are wonderful  the restaurant is super clean and lively. Great place for all ages 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,21,Bad timing at 8 30 on a Monday night  line out the door.  The kitchen tried to work quickly but it took a long time.  Finally got orders in  sat down and munched.  Food was good  tasty fish tacos and chicken burritos.  This issues was my daughter got back to the dorm and was immediately sick.  Not a great start for move in day.  Also  I was a little concerned as we were waiting in line.  We had someone be come in off the street  get a water cup and then proceed to hit every different drink at the fountain.  I hope this is not tied to the sickness.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,22,Think Chipotle but better... a LOT better. Not only are the ingredients more flavorful and not soaked in salt  it s also cheaper  For anyone looking for a good burrito with really tasty tortilla choices  definitely come.  Cilantro tomatillo is my favorite tortilla. The bits of springy-ness from the cilantro helps make an otherwise really heavy burrito a bit easier to stomach and more flavorful. I always ask for the tortillas to be toasted for a little extra longer  and the slightly crispy exterior plus the chewiness of the rest the tortilla and fillings tastes amazing. Fill the burrito with whatever you want  it ll taste good regardless  and definitely give their specialty sauces a try. Their 66 Red Sauce is a more acidic barbecue sauce  and if you like spice  try their XXtra Hot sauce that s both smoky  spicy  and really tasty.   Cabo Bob s always hits the spot  and is definitely worth a visit whether you re from Austin or just visiting 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,23,Love this place  The people  the ambiance  the food  esp. the tortillas  all wonderful
Cabo Bob's Burritos,24,I got to try Cabo Bob s Burritos during my trip to Austin  and it was definitely one for the books. Firstly  the parking is minimal. We definitely had to spend a few minutes  trying to look for some parking. When we got inside  we didn t have to walk far because the line was all the way to the door. This was perfect because we got to look through the menu a little bit and decide on what to order  and the service was super fast anyways.  Cabo Bob s Burritos is a  Chipotle -restaurant styled  where you get to pick your fillings  as you like. The thing that makes Cabo Bob s stand out  is the freshly pressed tortillas. Me and my party got the Ancho chilli and Cilantro tomatillo mix tortilla with the Baja fish. We got our variety of toppings  and sat down. I d like to commend Cabo Bob s for their serving sizes because the size of one burrito was perfect for two people to share. But the burrito. It was so delicious  I still think about this burrito  all the way in Florida. If I ever come to Austin again  I would come just for this burrito. HIGHLY recommend.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,25,The burritos here are good. For the style of burrito that they are  they re great. The ingredients are top notch and their tortilla  flour tortilla  game is on point with 4 distinct selections to choose from.  The burritos here aren t really my thing but my family loves them. I typically go with the fish tacos on ancho tortilla and am never disappointed. My only nitpick is that that quality of corn tortilla is lacking and doesn t make it a real option here. I say it s a nitpick because only a handful of places do not have the same issue.  Aside from the food  the people that work here are always fantastic. Professional  polite  and genuinely friendly. More than happy to come here for this reason and the couple of times I ve had any issues they resolve them quickly and with a smile.   I concur with any good compliments you ve read here regarding the food and service. That  however  is not why I m here.    Not the food   You say   Not the service   you inquire     Then what is it   you demand   I ll tell you what it is. The bathrooms. Sure they re single occupancy  which is the best when they re free and the worst when there s a line  but god dammit are the acoustics incredible. I don t know if it s the tile or the high ceilings or the combination of the two along with an ancient aural spell cast within those walls. Don t believe me  Next you go and lock that door behind you sing or whistle a tune. You will be amazed.  I went in  semi-ashamed fat guy just about to stuff some more food down my gullet and came out feeling like Luciano Pavarotti.   12 bucks got me a totally unwarranted ego boost that carried me through the week along with some tasty fish tacos on the side.  Very good food  legit great people  and bathrooms designed  probably  by Hans effing Zimmer.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,26,Had the  2 Fish Tacos. Three different tortilla flavors- ancho chili  cilantro and buttermilk- cooked as you order.  It was delicious.  The tortillas were flavorful.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,27,I am loving Cabo Bob s more and more every time I visit. All their workers are really nice  and I love that you can mix more than 2 types of tortillas in one. I also crave mango pico sometimes  and Cabo Bob s is the only burrito taco place I know that has it. Service is good  and you ll get your food and be on your way in a jiffy.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,28,So so good  I love their toppings and tortilla flavors. Really big portion sizes. The place is always pretty crowded but the line moves fast
Cabo Bob's Burritos,29,Great place    Food is way better than that other burrito place that we won t mention  LOL . Service is fast and good
Cabo Bob's Burritos,30,Cabo Bob s has been tasty each visit I ve had. I have now tried a burrito  a bowl  and a quesadilla. The bowl in my opinion is definitely the best out of the three. This is also the only build-your-own place I would trust eating fish from  it s amazing . The portions are pretty big so I look forward to the left overs my next meal  and unlike chipotle  these are actually super fresh  The rice stays hydrated  and yummy. Would recommend.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,31,Cabo Bob s is a UT Austin cult classic and for good reason  They differ from other  Build Your Own  burrito spots by offering  4 different types of tortillas  crispy fish  baja beans  mango pico  and sauces like chipotle crema and ancho rancho  Plus the ingredients are higher quality which gives it an overall better taste. And the price is comparable to Chipotle  Coming here is a no brainer. I got to give them an 4 5 for doing a great job 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,32,I really enjoyed the fresh tortillas and house made  toppings. However  I was really excited to try the crispy fried fish as it had the top reviews. The fish was barely warm and I think had been sitting in the container for a bit. Was expecting freshly fried fish. Other than that it was good and enjoyed the tacos. I also tried the brisket which had good flavor.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,33,My wife and I were walking around admiring the unique and interesting murals in the NW area of UT Austin and decided to have lunch at Cabo Bob s Burritos.  The parking lot was completely full so luckily we arrived by foot and inside found a long line of people waiting to order.  This is a place where you walk up  order  pay  and take your food with you for either take out or sit down. It s a great way to feed hungry college students being next to UT Austin.  The menu is basically about building your own burrito or taco. Looks simple but with all the selection of ingredients it can be overwhelming ... however they have prebuilt selections to help you out.  I was one of those people and selected the Baja Fish Tacos. The tortillas are made there front and fresh. As you slide down to pay you see your meal get made in front of you like an assembly line. No alcohol is served here which may explain why half the orders were for takeout.  We found a place inside to sit but there were available outside patio seating some with dogs with them. It s a nice mostly younger crowd with few parents.   The tacos were amazing and enjoy both. The fish was tasty mixed with Cabo s predefined ingredients and being full sized they filled me up. I was not alone where noticed many others ordered it too.   It was an excellent choice of eatery for lunch and afterwards went back to search for more murals. However they did have a nice one inside too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,34,This is one of the places I crave the most when I leave Austin for an extended period of time. My favorite thing to get here is the fish burrito. This is a great place to come with friends or just to grab a quick bite.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,35,Sup  Mark the reviewer here. This place is the GOAT burrito place. I m reviewing the location by UT Austin. For  8  there s no other place that ll give you a burrito this size. There are a lot of options for the burrito but I ll come clean and say I never get anything besides fish in my burrito. The fish is fried and they give a serviceable amount. All of the additional toppings you can add inside include rice  beans  cheese  and a variety of vegetables. I partially like the mango pico. They add sauces at the end but tbh it s kinda hard for me to taste the sauces with the mountain of food I get inside my burrito. But my go to sauces are chipotle creama and lime juice which is a nice combination of sour and savory. Anyway  the size of these burritos are huge and fill me up to the brim even though I can eat hella food. In my opinion  the best part about the burrito is the tortilla. Cabo makes the tortilla in front of you and you can mix and match from 4 different flavors. The tortilla is thick and could fill you up alone. It s very sturdy and has good flavor in it. Let s go 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,36,Looove their burritos so much  Think of this place as better freebirds chipotle but with more options of toppings to put in your food and freshly pressed tortillas for your burrito  They have about four types of tortilla to choose from  ancho Chile  cilantro  buttermilk  cheese  etc.   and three types of beans  Baja  black  pinto   lots of meat option to choose from  even fish    can t find that at other places . Unlike freebirds  their flavored tortillas actually taste like what they are made out of. One unique option from their proteins is their fried fish  tilapia   and it appears to be very popular among their customers.  I very much appreciate their variety of options for crafting the burritos  tacos  bowls  whatever you prefer. A MUST visit chain when you are in Austin. I promise 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,37,Better than chipotle  more options  greater food. It s more expensive than chipotle  but it s well worth it. I ve had the fish tacos  brisket bowl  fish bowl and chicken burrito. Never been disappointed. However  it does get really busy. The tortillas  veggies and salsas are my favorite things to get in any food here
Cabo Bob's Burritos,38,OUTSTANDING  Many great memories here dating back to the summer of 2015 when visiting friends who attended UT at the time.   The following words come to mind when thinking of Cabo Bob s   Flavorful. Quality. Filling.  It starts with the tortillas  which are made in-house right in front of you.  - White  Flour - Red  Ancho Chile - Green  Cilantro Tomatillo - Orange  Cheddar  Go with your gut. It might seem like a tough decision but you actually cannot go wrong      The next challenge  choosing what to fill your tortilla with. We ve never gone wrong ordering from Bob s Specials. Whether it s the fish tacos or brisket  amp  queso follow your heart s desire. As with the tortilla  there s a high likelihood you ll enjoy what you ordered.   And that s it. For under  10 out the door get ready for a FEAST.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,39,OH MY GOD BEST FOOD EVER. I love this place. 100000  recommend. The only place that I take my friends when they come and visit. 10 10
Cabo Bob's Burritos,40,When I say I want a burrito  I don t want just any burrito. I want THE burrito. Cabo Bob s is quite literally the best burrito place I have ever had the fortune of eating at. I ve been here many more times than I can count  all because of the quality and quantity of food you get. The value is through the roof  it s insane. You get MASSIVE burritos with much BETTER ingredients and TASTE for cheaper than what chipotle  qdoba  and all the other places can even think of offering.  The fish burrito is my go to choice here  definitely get the fish  chipotle cream sauce  and 66 chili sauce.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,41,You can t go wrong with Cabo  It s cheap and has massive portions. Typically  I would get a bowl at places like here  but I highly recommend getting anything that has their tortillas. I love mixing the doughs. Each burrito can easily feed me for two meals which is incredibly  and I ll return even if I m not near campus anymore 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,42,Maaaaaaaan I am really upset with myself for not coming here sooner  I ve lived within a mile of this location of Cabo Bob s for the past 5 or so years and never thought to try this place even though plenty of people encouraged me to over the years. I ordered a chicken burrito online and within 2 minutes my food was ready - good thing I live so close  When I got to Cabo Bob s I parked in one of the curbside pickup spots and texted the number I was there. They were so fast that when I looked up from my phone  a staff member was already at my window with my food  ... yes she scared me  yes I jumped... . My burrito was delicious and I loved being able to choose a custom tortilla flavor  the smoked cheddar was perfect  I can t wait to come back for more  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,43,I dig the decore more than anything else. When I walked in it struck me as a seafood chipotle and frankly...that s what it was but that s bot a bad thing. I of course got a few fish burrito and destroyed them in a matter if 3 minutes which is good and bad cause I was still hungry . Been meaning to make my way back there  def worth the trip
Cabo Bob's Burritos,44,I can t imagine my life before Cabo Bob s. What was I doing with my burrito life    I am in LOVE with their ancho chili tortilla. Their buttermilk and chilantro lime is pretty good too. I just love the ancho chili tortilla because it gives a unique rich flavor and depth to all the rest of the ingredients. Watching them make the tortillas right in front of you when you order  each order  is pretty cool too.   PRO-TIP  get the tacos so you can order all 3 flavors of tortilla to try them out or you re indecisive like me   You can definitely taste the freshness of all their ingredients. Pictured is their chicken tacos  come with 3 just 2 fit on the plate . I once got their fish tacos and they were really good too 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,45,Incredible fish tacos  ESPECIALLY because of the tortilla. The fish was perfectly crispy and not dry at all  the fillings  and jalepeno sauce in particular  were really tasty and complemented the flavors well  and the cilantro lime tortilla was soo good.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,46,Literally my all time favorite burrito place. Cabo bob s puts chipotle to shame. I first went here while a freshman at UT and it became a staple in my life ever since. I went every year for my birthday while living in Austin. I love their cheddar and buttermilk flour tortillas combined into one mixed burrito tortilla. And their queso is soooo good  They expanded to the Houston and San Antonio area but need to come up to Dallas 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,47,At first the service was great but by the time I made it to the last two ladies all service went down hill. After getting back to our Hotel we sat down to eat and the food was just like the service Poor.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,48,Literally amazing. This is better than chipotle  idk how it just is. You need to eat here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,49,A very big burrito  But it tastes good and is cheap. Recommend. If you are hungry  please visit.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,50,The best burrito in Austin   I usually get half chicken half fish. Mango pico is the best addition. Really casual spot that usually always has a line out the door.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,51,Chipotle but make it tropical  I love the from scratch  fresh tortillas at Cabo Bob s that come in    variations. I got the cheddar one for my  1 Just Fish Tacos  and they were lightly toasted and flakey  Like chipotle they ve got complimentary fixings that you can choose from or go with their set menu. I recommend leaning towards the crispy fish options  since their mango pico is unique and a must try  The pico is fruity  fresh  and a little spicy. I also got their chips and queso  which wasn t too exciting. Still some solid Texas queso though  They also offer Mexican sodas  always a welcome addition to tacos.  Usually spots near the university are too hard to get to  but Cabo Bob s has this huge parking spot all to itself. I came here during the winter holiday time  so there was even more space. Their main locations are scattered through out Austin  but this is a Texas chain for now.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,52,Normally I never have any complaints when it comes to Cabo everything is really fresh and always tastes good but today my bowl was super greasy and there was an entire puddle of grease that I had to drain from my bowl. Really ruined the entire meal for me which sucks because I always look forward to getting Cabo.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,53,Ever since living in San Diego for 10 years prior to moving out to Austin  I ve been in search of California style burritos Mexican food and this place does not disappoint in the slightest  I ve been here about 2 times so far but the level of customization on their burritos is incredible. Think chipotle but actually authentic and much more elevated  Last time I got the cilantro lime fresh pressed tortilla with grilled steak and all the fixings and I absolutely will be back to this establishment. They even have an outdoor patio for eating during these COVID times which I really appreciate. I ve even had their crispy fish tacos in the past and they were incredible   10 10 would recommend you check this place out.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,54,My tortilla was under done and tasted like dough. When I told the crew at the front they were rude and acted like it was a chore to re make it. They were so rude. They barely put any rice  beans or meat in the second burrito. Rip off and rude workers
Cabo Bob's Burritos,55,Really enjoyed the fish tacos and watching their efficient half-automated taco-burrito production line producing my dinner   This place rocks. Thank you 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,56,This place had a massive line when my boyfriend and I got in from out of town  so I had pretty high expectations based on how many people were at the location. It has a very similar set-up to Chipotle  but it is exponentially better. Despite how long the line was  they were able to move people through decently quickly. My boyfriend and I both ended up getting the tacos and they were delicious. It is a generous portion without being an absurd amount of food. When going through the line  they also have signs on the shield between the workers and the customers for the customers to point to so you aren t trying to yell which I thought was a nice touch. It was definitely loud on the inside  so this prevents things from getting messed up by difficulties in communication. The salsa was great  they had a large soda selection  and it is clearly a very popular place for a reason. I m from Ohio and was in Austin visiting and the next time I am in the area I will most certainly be going back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,57,We made a quick stop here for lunch during our visit to Austin. The line was long when we first arrived but don t be frightened  it moves really fast. Once in front  we picked what we wanted in our burrito and moved asking pretty quickly. There were stickers to help with digital distancing and everyone had to have their masks on. The was outside sitting since the inside was getting full. The burrito was good and it did the trick. It was big  do I had leftover to snack on later in the day.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,58,This is THE burrito place to go to. If you are visiting Austin please do not waste your time at Chipotle or Qdoba. I I come here regularly  3  times a week  and I can confidently say that they make the BEST burritos.   Your journey starts with four different options for the kind of tortilla you want  you can also ask them to combine them to make your burrito unique  . From here  you get your choice of rice  beans  protein  and veggies. Their fried fish is my favorite- you must try it. Next  you can choose from a standard selection of toppings including sour cream  lettuce  and salsa. Last  choose your dressings- I recommend chipotle cream  lime juice  and 66 sauce. Their 66 sauce is incredible and I would honesty buy it in buckets if they had that option.   All in all  this is a must try place in Austin- you cannot find a better lunch or dinner place at this price point. Not to mention their burritos will honestly last you two meals considering how big they are .
Cabo Bob's Burritos,59,My first meal in Texas was an absolute treat  We were looking for a last-minute place to grab a bite to eat and were lucky to find Cabo Bob s Burritos was open. I saw there were great Yelp reviews so we decided to give it a try  plus I can always go for a delicious burrito. There was a long line  which was not surprising given the fact Austin is a college town and it was a Thursday night. It gave us all enough time to figure out what we wanted. I was able to choose between one of their menu items or I could have made my own burrito - the choices were endless. Even the tacos looked amazing - I COULD NOT DECIDE   Before I go any further  I could tell there was great morale among the workers. Even though they were working non-stop  they had smiles on their faces and honestly seemed that they enjoyed what they were doing. I also liked how they guy who was first in the  assembly line  was REALLY enjoying making those fresh tortillas  yup  they make them fresh to order  .  D  I ended up choosing the Chicken Burrito with a cilantro tortilla. It was the perfect size  served hot  and it was absolutely DELICIOUS. This was an authentic Tex-Mex experience that you cannot get outside of Texas. I highly recommend you pay a visit to Bob s for a legitimate Tex-Mex burrito. I would definitely try their tacos too 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,60,Cabo bob s hooks it up  These guys know whatsup. No stinginess or low quality here. Just a solid meal.  Don t be surprised to wait 10-20 minutes in line. It s worth the wait. When you serve quality food  people will wait In line
Cabo Bob's Burritos,61,This place is the BEST food in Austin Texas  The staff is so kind. Edward  the manager  always makes the experience great    Cabo Bob s is set up chipotle style. It is so delicious. Their homemade tortillas are incredible. My favorites are ancho chili and cheddar  Their 66 red sauce is the BEST hot sauce. Plus  their mint tea is something I crave regularly.   They have a location close to campus that is very convenient for students.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,62,I love this place. Cabo Bob s is the best burrito chain and for the price of about  7- 8 you really can t get anything better. Usually  at restaurants when you re out to eat  you sacrifice quantity for quality  or vice versa. At Cabo Bob s  get burritos any size and stuff it however big you want. It s seriously the best place around campus and the best bang for your buck.   Food  Oh my god. They hand make their tortillas right in front of you  and they have a wide range of ingredients that you can t find anywhere else. You can t even compare it to Chipotle  Qdoba  or any other burrito place. You can choose from pork  steak  fish  which is bomb   and chicken among other options. Splash some lime juice with mango pico and you re all set   Service  Nothing out of the ordinary  but they sure don t question you if you pack your burrito with a lot of ingredients. Friendly staff.  Atmosphere  Great vibe  and there s usually a wait when you go at peak times  so make sure to account for that    Overall  it is the best burrito place to hit up when in Austin  maybe ever. Might go back this week lol.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,63,tortillas are amazing   make sure u get it on the side if u get a bowl. it s a good everyday kind of meal and pretty healthy too  i loveee the fish it s so good
Cabo Bob's Burritos,64,This spot is my go-to spot by UT for when I am craving some delicious tacos. For my order  I usually get two brisket tacos and one steak taco and it never fails to disappoint.   In terms of the overall experience  if you haven t tried Cabo Bobs you are missing out because this place is the best and I am going to tell you why. No matter the day the staff are always friendly and are always give great recommendations if you want to try something new.   Beware though sometimes the line can be long especially during peak eating times such as lunch dinner but don t worry usually this place moves the line quickly. Probably my favorite feature of Cabo Bobs is the vacation-like atmosphere as well as the punch card where after 6 visits you can get a free entree or a T-shirt.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,65,To me this beat Chipotle  Uberitto  Bullritos  Freebirds  and all the other Mexican burrito places you can think of. They have this extravagant fish  which I ve heard is the most popular meat  because it s so good. Cabo Bob s has Mango Pico de Gallo which I absolutely loved. You can blend in 2 different tortillas  into one big burrito which I thought was sooo dope. Will for sure be hitting this again next time I m in Austin.

Cabo Bob's Burritos,66,Visited late on a Saturday night. Had a long line  but it went by quickly and the staff was very friendly and on task. The floors and restrooms were a bit dirty and seating was hard to find. The food itself was flavorful  everything from the protein to the veggies. In addition  they have healthy options  plentiful portions  and filling entrees. I will definitely visit again for a meal on the go 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,67,I ve only been here twice. The first time I got a fish burrito  which is their most popular item  and the second time was recent  and I got their best beef burrito. Surprisingly  I prefer the beef burrito. It was very melty and the cheese and beef came together well. Both times that I ve been here  I would only eat half of the burrito and save the rest for another meal  which is a very good deal considering how cheap it is. There s a reason why Cabo Bob s is so popular for students. My second visit left more of an impression on me than my first one  and I actually want to come back and possibly try a different combination or the same beef burrito.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,68,Ordered a pick up for lunch. First time here. A buddy recommended the fried fish. Had a burrito with that  Baja beans and lots of other stuff. Fantastic. Will be back to try different things.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,69,Came here for a quick lunch. It s the type of place where all of the items are on display and you pick what you want on your burrito bowl  etc. Everything was very tasty and portions were really good for the price. The restaurant itself was clean and had indoor and outdoor seating. Line was a little long at lunch but it moved quickly. We really liked how the tortillas were freshly made in front of you.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,70,These tortillas are sent from heaven. All the ingredients are fresh and delicious  and you get a lot for the price  They also always get my order right when I order online  and have it ready quickly. This is my go-to spot near campus  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,71,We had a really delicious chicken burrito and I enjoyed the sauces that came with it.  The chips were thick and crisp which I loved.  Great queso 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,72,Surprised it took me so long to post a review for the best damn burrito place in all of Austin. If you find yourself hungry in Austin and you ve never been to Cabo Bob s  then it s time to ask yourself what went wrong in your life. Luckily  the answer to your problem is simple - Get to Cabo Bob s now   Easily  the best thing about CB s are the homemade flour tortillas which come in Buttermilk Flour  Ancho Chili  Smokey Cheddar  and Cilantro Tomatillo  but that just where the fun begins. Next  you load up on the chicken  the shredded pork  the brisket  the steak or even the crispy fish  followed by the beans  rice  queso  veggies and assorted toppings.   Don t forget the queso and chips and the sweet tea  or cold bottled soda  and you re ready to dig in.   They ve got several area locations  but we favor the west campus restaurant because it s the favorite hangout for Longhorns students and staff  especially before big games and after study hours. Grab an amazing mouth full  drop fewer bucks than you d expect  and hook  em Horns at Cabo Bob s.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,73,Hands down the BEST FISH TACOS I have ever tasted.  I am NOT exaggerating.  So delicious and loaded with fish   I got the deluxe fish tacos with cilantro lime  smoked cheddar and regular flour tortillas. WOW. I was happily surprised by the cheese one as I have never found anything like that before   My husband who got a brisket and queso burrito mentioned how this was his very first time in years where he enjoyed the tacos more than the burrito    And I m talking about a  1 burrito fan who enjoys burritos just like a man enjoys Sunday football on his couch with a beer in hand .   The restaurant may remind you of a Chipotle just because of how the choice of the ingredients is set up behind a glass for you to pick more easily. However  in my opinion Cabo Bob s is a one of a kind. So  please  go and enjoy because I m telling you it s 100  worth it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,74,This is my favorite place to eat on campus. The way the food is served is similar to Chipotle where you go down the line telling the server what you want. However  something about their food makes it so refreshing and guilt free. Food quality is nothing like chipotle  it s much better   I usually order the fish bowl  tortilla on the side of course      with lime juice and all the veggies. It s a place where you can choose to eat health or not based on what you want to put in your order. Also their special flavored tortillas are amazing    This place is definitely a must try if you like great service  short wait  and great quality food.   Tip  they have a punch card system  After you purchase 6 orders at Cabo  your next order of burrito bowl is on them 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,75,Came here all the time while going to school at UT. Have never been to the other locations but this place was great. Somewhat remote and to itself. It provides a nice outdoor eating area away from all the commotion. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the Austin area 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,76,No place will ever compare to cabo bobs. WAY TOO GOOD. I go to college out of state  so when I come back home to Austin  the very first thing I do before I even get home is go to cabo bobs. Theyre food is incredible.  I recommend getting the buttermilk tortillas for either your burrito or tacos. Bury me at cabo bobs. 10 10 every time I go. Love it
Cabo Bob's Burritos,77,Hands down my favorite burrito place. Portions are large and all the food tastes fresh. The staff is exceedingly friendly. I have been going to this place for years now and it has always exceeded expectations. The ambiance is very nice and gives off beach vibes.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,78,chipotle on steroids and delivers every time. fantastic casual dining place  and just as good for pickup 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,79,I love this place  It s so delicious and their portions are generous. Their employees are always kind and service is speedy. I love the variety you can get in meals  such as fish  chicken or beef. This place is way better than Chipotle and would recommend to anyone visiting Austin.   05 29 2019 - Place is still amazing 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,80,Hands down the best fish tacos ever  I always get the  1 fish tacos and it always taste amazing and fulfilling  The fish is crispy and seasoned to perfection.   Everything is fresh and made to order which is great. You can see them make the food in front of you as it goes down the assembly line.   I wished there was a location closer to me so I wouldn t have to drive so far. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Prices are very affordable for the portion.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,81,It has been said before  but perhaps not during a coronavirus shut down  Cabo Bob s is as good a Mexican restaurant as you will ever find.  I went in yesterday to pick up an order made online.  All the employees were wearing substantial masks and all the take out orders were well sealed and stapled.  As always  the place is immaculate and the ambiance is friendly and cheerful.  In the midst of this shut down there is even an optimistic defiance  everything will be made perfectly according to their high standards and the welcome each patron receives is as hearty as it is sincere.  Many have praised the food to the heavens  something it well deserves.  Let me add that  in my opinion  their buttermilk taco  around any filling  is absolutely addictive  in the best way   these are times that we are asked to practice social distancing so it is delightful to know there is such a superb local spot that allows you  in safety  to engage in a friendly community and be so rewarded with the best food in town.  thanks  Cabo Bob s 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,82,Great burritos and LOVE the queso   No matter what you get it s always delicious. Both the burrito and the tacos are both super great
Cabo Bob's Burritos,83,I love Cabo bob s food  their fish is delicious  but I have to say this... they get my order wrong every time. And I mean every. Single. Time. Whether it s online or in person  it s incorrect. Today  in store  I ordered a  2. No changes or substitutions. Tried to make it easy. They still got their own creation incorrect. I had to ask for sides of three ingredients they missed. Pleaseeeeee do better.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,84,The fish burrito was amazing    Had it on the cheese tortilla. Great vibes all around inside and out. We ate our food on the patio. The salsa verde had a nice tiny kick to it as well
Cabo Bob's Burritos,85,Delicious fresh tortillas at any location. Great choices for any burrito  taco  or bowl. Highly recommend grabbing a bite.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,86,Unsung hero in Austin for a burrito bar.   Cabo Bob s does not get enough credit  undermined by similar chain restaurants like Chipotle and Freebirds But Cabo Bob s blows them out of the water     Ingredients are extremely fresh and different from your typical choices with options such as the mango salsa and tomatillo sauce. No one else that I know of is doing crispy fish either  and they re doing it right. They do not skimp on the portions and burritos bowls come out huge.  Different flavored tortillas for you to choose from and are pressed fresh to each order.  It is one of my new favorites in town  I only wish they had some more locations up North  and that they weren t closed on Sundays.   Most of the time they do have quite a long line and moves kind of slow  but in the end it s totally worth it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,87,Hands down  the best burrito place around campus. It s not even a contest. The huge portions  the variety of options  the excellent choices for tortillas  cheddar tortilla   Sign me up homie   and the many tvs  this place is the bomb. Only downside  the fact that its located in the far north of the drag. If it was located where the current Chipotle is on the drag  they will need a line manager outside the store.  I almost always get the fish burrito every time I come. It s the absolute bomb  By far the best fish taco or burrito you will have. The pico de gallo with mango is super fresh and phenomenal.  For  7  I definitely can t a find a better place that provides as much value. They also offer a punch card where every 10th burrito is free.  Have been coming here for 3 years and definitely will be back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,88,Blows Chipotle away.  That s all.  Nuff said.  I get the bowls  but everyone else likes their fresh tortilla options
Cabo Bob's Burritos,89,Ordered online and pre-paid for a pork bowl with red  amp  green salsa  cheese  and basically all veggies.  Got it home and discovered a rice and beans bowl with no salsa and NO PORK.  Thanks guys.  Knocked it out of the park there
Cabo Bob's Burritos,90,This is literally my favorite restaurant. Throughout college  Cabo has always been a place of happiness  great food  and great service. Whenever I have to leave Austin  one of the things that I will miss most is Cabo. Ivan in particular has provided wonderful service all throughout Covid. Anyone looking for a genuine Austin experience - this is the place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,91,This Cabo bobs is one of my favorites everyone is so friendly and everyone is so hardworking. They treat you like if you were part of their family. Once you come a few times they ll know your order lol. Shout out to Brisa I hope I spelled that right she makes the most sick mixed tortillas and is a bad ass at the dough presser. She knows what she s doing if she is ever on press ask for a mixed tortilla you ll be in awe   Thank you guys keep up the great food and service if I could give you guys more stars I would 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,92,Always a good place to go to when in Austin  When my group of friends and I arrived  there was a line that snaked around just to order. Granted  it was a Friday night and it took about 20-25 minutes to get through the line  but it was definitely worth the wait. I recommend if you do want to get food from here during rush hour  order online so you can pick it up.   The food was made quickly and looked fresh. They were very efficient and made the process seem effortless despite how busy they were. I got the Crispy Fish Burrito with a buttermilk flour and cilantro tomatillo tortilla.I also added my own toppings inside of it. The food was hot and ready to eat and I honestly don t think I ve ever had a better burrito than Cabo.   There was plenty of seating here  however  the only complaint I have is that the tables and chairs were slightly dirty after customers would leave. Other than that  Cabo is one of my favorite places to come to when I visit 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,93,The food here is delicious and the burritos are huge. The fish is lightly breaded and fried  but not oily at all. I really enjoyed the burrito with fish here. The chipotle cheddar wrap is the best 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,94,This spot has adjusted nicely to Covid-19. It has lots of outdoor seating and a quick  safe ordering process. I really enjoyed my lunch eating on their shaded outdoor patio.   I deducted a star from Cabo Bobs because its food didn t have enough spice and flavor. The recipes here accommodate too many palates and are too safe. This is an Austin restaurant and it should have weird  crazy flavors.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,95,This place is awesome. It s like chipotle but way better ingredients and a much wider array of choices ie three different types of rice beans  multiple tortillas for your burrito and the chips are made awesome. Customer service is also very good here  employees greet you and try to get you through the line as fast as possible
Cabo Bob's Burritos,96,I always feel like I m back in college since there are a lot of students and long lines. It only reinforces how yummy and greatly priced their food is.   The fish tacos and burritos are amazing. The fish is lightly breaded and tastes delicious with a squirt of lime juice.   It s build your own with soooo many great options. The portions are large  so you ll surely fill up even when you re super hangry  You can t go wrong with Cabo Bob s  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,97,Food  5 5  - I m not going to lie to you - Cabo is hands down the best burrito chain I have ever head. The variety is several orders of magnitude better than Chipotle or Qdoba with expansive options for tortillas  meats  toppings  and sauces. I live down the street from Cabo and eat here at least once a week  usually more.  Service  4 5  - The staff is nice and usually game for a conversation. The line could move a little more quickly  though they can t help when they regularly get swamped around dinner time.  Ambiance  4 5  - Pretty much what you d expect from a surfer-themed burrito joint. It s definitely a vibe  and you can t go wrong with eating in.  Value  5 5  - Cabo is several cents cheaper than Chipotle and the burritos are far more filling. I eat A LOT  and a Cabo burrito leaves me feeling like Santa Claus. Plus the punch card makes every 7th burrito free  which is a pretty hefty discount over the long run.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,98,BEST BOWLS IN AUSTIN. Way prefer this over chipotle or Qdoba. Cabo s queso is the perfect taste for any bowl. Plus the nacho cheese and chilantro tortillas are the way to go  All of the meat options here rock and are consistently fresh and delish.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,99,Move aside chipotle  Uberito  and firebirds  there s a new sheriff in town. Cabo bob s surpasses them all. Love love love the fact that they create the tortilla in front of us  as well as multiple toppings and sauces. The mango pico de Gallo is phenomenal. This with fried fish is my go to every time 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,100,Terrible first time experience. Food to pick up 300 minutes late  no delivery to car as promised. Cash register person didn t know what he was doing. Food orders wrong. Food cold. Didn t get what paid for. I ll never order or eat here again. Food quality also low. Very subpar.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,101,Cabo Bob s made me feel like I was in burrito heaven. I have had terrible experiences with burritos in the past that either give me food poisoning or fall apart after a bite. My friend kept pushing me to go to this place and I finally agreed.   Initially  when I came here I was planning on getting a rice bowl but when my friend ordered a burrito I saw that they made the burrito tortilla fresh on the press in front of us so I was like hmm maybe I ll give burritos another chance. I ordered the chicken burrito with sour cream  cheese  pico de gallo  rice  and lettuce. This looked like a promising burrito and I was so excited to try it.  The first bite did not disappoint. In that first bite  I could tell all the ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The chicken itself was 10x better than Chipotle s  which has always tasted weird to me and is sometimes cold. I couldn t finish it because it s giant    The day after I wanted to come back. This is a place that would be impossible to get tired of. I just wished I lived closer because it s a 30 minute walk from my dorm       All in all  I highly recommend this place to burrito lovers and burrito haters  like me in the past . You won t regret eating here 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,102,The manager contacted me and gave me a meal on the house to give them another chance. Food was fresh per usual and no bug this time.  Kudos to the management here 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,103,I love this place  It s so delicious and their portions are generous. Their tortillas are freshly pressed and cooked and come in various flavors. I always get the steak  but all the proteins are delicious - yes even the battered fish  There are plenty of toppings to choose from when you build your own burrito  but there are also their own designed tacos.  The food was made quickly and looked fresh. They were very efficient and made the process seem effortless despite how busy they were. ALSO  if you re trying to get the most bang for your buck  I would suggest getting the bowl with your 2 small tortillas on the side for no extra cost  Their employees are always kind and service is speedy.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,104,This place is the BOB.COM. I ve only been in Austin a few days and have mostly been eating and drinking  but I ll forever have a satisfied food baby from this place. The burritos are the size of a new born   This place is neat because they press the tortillas in front of you  and they let you pick the flavor of the tortilla. The concept is similar to a chipotle  but like 10 times better.   I got a burrito with crispy fish and the actual fish was cooked great and tasted amazing. I put some queso on the burrito and they was a great touch  They also have a mango salad to add to burrito which was a great sweet kick.   When I m Austin  EAT.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,105,Cabo Bob s is one of my favorite places to eat in Austin    For those that do not know what Cabo Bob s is  think of it as a local style Chipotle except with more options to customize your order. For example  there are 4 different tortilla options - buttermilk flour  ancho chili  cilantro tomatillo  and smokey cheddar - which you can also combine any of these different options together if you can t decide between 2.  I always get the burrito and typically  change it up a little each time I go and would recommend you do the same and try out different things each time you come in  Some things that I ve tried and loved - the smokey cheddar tortilla  ancho chili tortilla  cilantro tortilla  chicken  brisket  chipotle crema  and their 66 red sauce.  They also have a few TVs set up  typically playing a sports game   which I really appreciate.   There is usually a pretty long line around lunch and dinner time but would say not to be intimidated because the line moves pretty quickly   Overall  I don t think you can ever go wrong with Cabo Bob s  Great burritos and friendly employees   Note - they are closed on Sunday s
Cabo Bob's Burritos,106,I love cabo bob s - the fried fish   FOOD   This place works like Chipotle and Q doba  BUT the best thing was its fried fish as meat option. Another really good thing is that the tortilla and its choices of tortilla. It s somehow manage to hold the biggest burrito...  ATMOSPHERE   FISH SEAGULL BOAT WATER  YUHH  amp  it s clean  SERVICE   They re great   SURROUNDINGS   It s far end of Guad-ish.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,107,I can t believe its taken me 4  years to write a review for the best burrito place on planet earth. To give you a little preface    If burritos were people  Cabo Bobs would be Beyonc .  If burritos were NBA players  Cabo Bobs would be Lebron James.  If burritos were artists  Cabo Bobs would be Drake.  If burritos were animals  Cabo Bobs would be the GOAT.   Need I say more  I dare you to try this place out for yourself and see if you feel otherwise. You can customize the burrito to your hearts desire but below are the things you MUST get in your burrito  ancho chili tortilla  brisket  queso  chipotle crema  saut ed onions  hot jalape o  pico  and LOTS AND LOTS of Red 66 Xxtra Hotxx. You can thank me now or you can thank me later.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,108,Really yummy and fresh food  The employees were all really nice and welcoming. The pricing is really reasonable for what you get and I had a good experience my first time. There was a pretty sizable wait time in line during the lunch rush but once you got to the point that you could order the process to checkout went very quickly and smoothly.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,109,When Cabo Bob s first opened up on 71 and I tried it  I fell in love.  These huge burritos at dirt cheap prices   And fried fish tacos burritos too   Fantastic.  A few years removed now from college  however  and the luster has dulled.  I came back to Austin and went to the West Campus location.  I d been here before  but it was radically different than a couple years ago.  It seemed to be a thousand times more popular  with a 20  minute wait just to get to the counter.   This seems promising   I remember thinking to myself.   If it s popular  it must still be just as good as I remember    Unfortunately  not  however.  The burritos are still  admittedly huge.  You also get your choice of tortilla dough  which you can even mix   and you can watch them flatten and toast up the huge tortilla right in front of you.  That s pretty cool and mesmerizing to watch.  Unfortunately  however  the food quality wasn t as great as I remembered.  I had fried fish with brown rice  and the fish didn t leave much of an impression on me.  The small pieces of fish weren t very flavorful or substantial in the burrito  lost in a sea of carbs and veggies.  The brown rice too was bland and dry  making the burrito overall flavorless and a disappointment.  The veggies were good  but I left feeling full - filled with sadness and regret.  Maybe it was college me that was just so enamored with huge burritos  but I don t think it s worth it anymore.  If all you care about is quantity though  Bob s got your back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,110,This place is amazing  Basically local styled Chipotle Qdoba but so much better. If you re into big burritos  you can order one with a special tortilla  e.g. cheddar cheese flavor  since they make them in-house. You can also ask for a bowl   the tortilla on the side which is what I usually do. Load up on all the free extras  Of course  the queso and guacamole are good add-ons. Expect this place to be packed during lunch hour with college students. Young vibe and solid food  definitely a favorite 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,111,I remember going to cabo bob s for the first time when I was a wee little freshman at UT. Back then  I ordered some tacos which were pretty good  but nothing mind blowing.  Three years later  I m now a senior at UT and I can say without a doubt that cabo bob s is one of the best places in Austin to eat.  You HAVE to get a burrito  after all it s in the name of the freaking restaurant  The most unique part about this place compared to any other burrito place is that they have different flavored tortillas that you can get. Personally  the ancho Chile is my favorite but you can t go wrong with any of them. The best meat to get here is definitely the fish  it s head and shoulders above the rest of the competition. However  their chicken and steak are also really good if you re not a fish type of person. The sauces are also what makes Cabo s special. Their 66 red spicy sauce is super tasty  and if it s not spicy enough for you there s even an extra hot version.  The only gripe I have about this place is that the wait times can be really long during lunch and dinner hours  but that s just proof that this place is that good.  Once you try cabo s  you ll never want to eat at chipotles qdoba freebirds  again.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,112,Bougie Chipotle is how I describe the place. Without a price upgrade  the food quality increases in terms of flavor and options. I m a huge fan of the crispy fried fish and mango salsa.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,113,I have been to Cabo Bob s multiple times and  man  is this place WORTH. It s Chipotle-style where you go and tell them if you want a burrito or a bowl and the ingredients you want added.   Parking  There is a small parking lot right outside with probably  10 spots. I ve never had trouble finding parking.  Atmosphere  Light-hearted  casual. Indoor and outdoor seating available.   Service  The workers are usually pretty helpful and give generous scoops.  Food  This is where the 5 stars comes in. First  you get to choose between 4 different types of tortillas  made fresh in front of your face. I ll usually get the Cilantro tortilla. Then  the meats. I personally LOVE getting the crispy fish  tilapia . Sometimes  I ll even get double fish portions   If you come here and get these  add some chipotle mayo sauce to your burrito  and you are SET.   The burritos cost like  8 and will heartily fill you up. Come here and you ll won t regret it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,114,There was once a week when i went to cabo bobs 3 times in one week. I have used up at like 2 punch cards since i found cabo bobs a year ago. I always get the crispy fish burrito with the cilantro tomatillo tortilla. The tortilla is my favorite part  it tastes like those delicious asian green onion pancakes. I always ask for a little bit of queso and lots of lime juice  rice  black beans  lettuce  and cabbage. It s the most delicious thing you can eat on the drag in my opinion. Cabo bobs is better than chipotle and qdoba for those reasons  the ingredients and the tortillas.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,115,Food  5 5 Uhhhh only the best fried fish burritos in town     And mango salsa   Hot sauce bottles that you can take to your table           And what s this....4 flavors of tortillas    Makes this place my favorite spot to get burritos in town  Also they have grilled onions and peppers. What a blessing from heaven  Service  4 5 The people are always happy to help. They re usually super busy juggling an endless stream of customers as well as call in orders. Great people. Many a time they ran out of my favorite fried fish. Got em freshly made and seasoned in just a few minutes. Love it  Atmosphere  3 5 It s a really casual place. Beach theme. Cabo bobs  according to them  represents the spirit of the chill  relaxed individual. I always have a good time w friends here  Bathrooms  3 5 Nothing special to note. Decent cleanliness. Gendered.  Price  3 5 You re probably going to pay around  8-10  That s pretty average I feel like. If you re not the biggest eater  a burrito might get you two meals 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,116,Hands down  this is sooooooo much better than Chipotle  After finding out about this place  I don t think I will ever go to Chipotle again whenever I m on west campus.  Cabo Bob s has the same concept as Chipotle. You get in line and decide which ingredients to put in your bowl or burrito.   Ingredients are fresh  meat are juicy  and there is a wide range of varieties for the sauce and the tortilla flavor. There are four types of tortilla flavors you can choose from  buttermilk flour  ancho chili  smokey cheddar  and cilantro tomatillo. My favorite one is the cilantro tomatillo.   If you re looking for the biggest portion size  get the burrito instead of the bowl. But that does not mean the bowl has a small portion size. I usually get a bowl with a side of tortillas  and I get full after eating half of what the bowl has.  There are plenty of tables offered both inside and outside. The restaurant also has couple of large tables that can fit in about six people for each table.  Gosh - I am so glad that I found out about Cabo Bob s. Thank you Cabo Bob s for making something better than Chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,117,During the CoronaVirus pandemic  this business is allowing patrons to enter inside the main dining room without masks. I imagine the staff here are staying atop standards  the curbside delivery person had a mask  amp  gloves  but it s impossible to manage the standards of people entering   leaving  touching door handles and counter tops as often as I watched them do while I was in the parking lot waiting for my order. Won t be returning here for a good while considering this wild oversight.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,118,2 years later and this place is still the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a   I don t eat here very often  but every time I do go here I always end up asking myself   Why don t aI eat here more often      As you can see in the picture  they don t play with their portions. They re huge  They had to double foil my burrito  I prefer the ancho chili tortilla to make a huge burrito. This time I didn t get my typical fried fish  I felt adventurous and went for their pulled pork. I m glad I did because I think it s my new favorite now  Make sure you grab a lot of napkins  the juice from the pork will drip out of the foil.   Service is always friendly and seating areas are clean. Can t wait to come back again 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,119,Yum. Cabo beats them all. It doesn t get much fresher than this.  THEY MAKE YOUR TORTILLA RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE.   So just imagine how far that speaks into how fresh their other ingredients are.   With several options of meat  and of course the fish  options never get old. I m pretty sure most people come here for the burrito bowl  and more than often order the fish. You have to try it.   I usually order the bowl with tortilla on the side. I ll switch up the meats and get almost all the free options. Mango pico is amazing. I ll put lemon concentrate and chipotle mayo as well as their super spicy home made sauce.   I m actually craving Cabo right now as I write this.   If you live in west campus and haven t visited this place yet  come eat here for your next lunch. I m sure you ll feel the same as I do.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,120,We can t help but like Cabo Bob s. We d been once before  but it never really occurred to us to go again until the wait at El Patio was 1.5 hours last Thursday night. We quickly changed gears and came here.  The line is chaotic. The guy handling the grilling of the tortillas wasn t particularly helpful about getting our daughter s quesadilla made and the guy at the register was very flustered. Everyone else at the other stations was on it. The quesadilla ended up being pretty gross  as is the queso there. Everything else is pretty good though  one of us got a salad with pulled pork and a bunch of fresh toppings  the other got a chicken burrito with ALL the fixings.   There s nothing extraordinary about the food other than that portions are massive  prices are fair  and it s just a bit of a silly experience overall. Also  you get to support a local business. We ll probably be back again in another few years when the burrito craving strikes.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,121,I wanted to love this place. Everyone was like  yes  Cabo Bob s is the BEST  I felt like  as the stars say  A-OK. The first time I had it I went in with the bf. I got the green tortilla  which made my burrito taste a little weird.  Don t get me wrong  I love veggies  but it just had sort of an odd taste to it.  The food inside was fine  but  eh  overall. I gave them one other chance when I was planning an event and a friend said they were fantastic.  So we ordered catering - we got chicken  steak and veggies. They were a good size  pretty filling  but I ate the chicken and it was literally chicken  rice  and maybe something else  beans  . I can t remember now  it was a while ago.  But I wanted more - where was the tomatoes  Lettuce  etc. Everyone seemed friendly  and maybe you ll like it better.  But I think I ll stick to Taco Deli or Chipotle  at least for now.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,122,Best burritos tacos in town. Lines can get long on weekends and during dinner time. Good service  fresh food and really affordable 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,123,Their fish tacos are amazing  Best burritos and tacos at UT. It s busy sometimes but worth the wait every time 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,124,My first time at Cabo Bob s  It was really busy as it s a holiday and all the students were out of school  but we still got helped in a timely manner. The food was AMAZING  I got the fish burrito with a Smokey cheddar tortilla  there are plenty of flavors for the tortillas and they are freshly made  soooo good . Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating   a friendly staff  All around great place
Cabo Bob's Burritos,125,If I had to pick  I would choose Cabo Bobs over Chipotle any day. You get to pick what flavor tortilla you want  and it s freshly prepared right before you order. Also they have much more variety in terms of toppings and menu  I usually get fish tacos or a chicken burrito. I like to add grill onions and mango pico on everything. Their chipotle creama is a must get. Trust me  that sauce goes well with all their items and brings all the toppings together. After my tacos are made  I like to drizzle some red pepper sauce on top to give it an extra kick.   Great place to grab lunch that comes under  8.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,126,This place hands down has the best burritos in town  Fresh ingredients  including the wow factor of tortillas pressed right before your eyes. So many different options and crazy ways to customize your food  All the meats looked amazing  I had steak and chicken in my burrito while the hubby had the roasted pork. The flavor was out of control.  Every single bite was as savory as the last and I literally can t wait to come back here and try something new   Cabo Bob s did not disappoint by any means  well worth the wait 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,127,Every college student tight wallet adults  dreams.   Cabo Bob s knows fish tacos when so many fancy Tex Mex restaurants have failed me.   First  they give you THREE hefty tacos with at least two scrumptious pieces of freshly fried fish filets each.   Second  they make the tortillas right in front of you.   Third  it s less than  10.   You get me   P.S. their burrito is the size of a body builder s biceps if that fancies you instead
Cabo Bob's Burritos,128,Can t beat their deluxe fish tacos. Don t forget to double up the fish. Great food you can count on.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,129,I was so excited to try this place  given the stellar reviews  I had a free meal and then a free burrito on account of them sort of forgetting our order the first time--so  for the price I paid  it was decent  but I wouldn t pay full price.  Upon unwrapping my burrito I found it was busted open in the middle so I had to eat half of it with a spoon. This would have been necessary anyway though as the way the burrito was wrapped  all the good stuff was on one end. And maybe I got a bad batch  but the poblanos were kind of cold and hard to chew. As was the rice  which had a handful of really hard pieces in it that hurt my teeth.   The fish on the taco was okay. Just okay. Just kind of tasted like breading and was maybe a bit dry. They neglected to add the cabbage I asked for. The tortilla on both my burrito and my fish tacos were so soggy they sort of stuck together in a shriveled little cocoon that had the tack of something more like the inside of an egg roll. But this could be because they forgot about our order or something  For some reason it was 15 minutes late  they did give us a coupon for a free burrito though .  The veggie burrito as designed by default had no spice at all and while edible  was  even at the low price of free  kind of disappointing. The one I built myself was better  but the above flaws remained.  The reviews about the  guacamole  aren t wrong  it does in fact taste like plain smashed avocados. Where s the salt  The lime  I routinely make lazy guac by smashing an avocado in a bowl with some juice  salt  and pepper  and that still tastes a lot better than whatever this is.  The queso on the other hand was fine  although I don t know that you can really get queso wrong. I felt like the chips-to-queso ratio was way off though  as I still had half my chips left  even when going easy on the cheese. They also forgot our sauces the first time and forgot the chips for the kids meal the second.  All around a pretty disappointing experience and I genuinely have no idea how people are calling this the best Tex-Mex in Austin or the best fish tacos in Austin. It tasted bland  even with added sauces   looked unappetizing  had funky textures  and the service was consistently below average  aside from the coupon  which was a nice gesture .  I will say though that I baked the second half of my burrito  easily two meals for a tiny gal like myself  and added my own sauce and it tastes considerably better. The limp soggy tortillas are easily the biggest issue with the texture  and baking it was a huge improvement. I ll also say the churro blondie is great.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,130,I would choose Cabo over chipotle any day  I love how fresh the ingredients taste and you can t go wrong with their fried fish. They make the tortilla in front of you and you can choose to mix 2 together  They have a variety of toppings and meats and dressings  I recommend the chipotle creme and fresh lime juice.   Deff get a punch card  It s so worth     Sometimes the lines can get long but they usually move pretty quickly. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. I also never have trouble finding parking at this place 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,131,Step aside Chipotle Freebirds Qdoba  This is the must-go for a quick burrito in town. Their tortillas are freshly pressed and cooked and come in various flavors. I always get the steak  but all the proteins are delicious - yes even the battered fish  There are plenty of toppings to choose from when you build your own burrito  but there are also their own designed tacos. ALSO  if you re trying to get the most bang for your buck  I would suggest getting the bowl with your 2 small tortillas on the side for no extra cost   At the end  be sure to use your punch card as you get your 6th meal free  Don t forget to grab their sauces too - it s more on the barbecue side but their XXTRA hot one will definitely make your nose run  Never disappoints and worth the trek from campus 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,132,It s a cool experience to see your tortillas being prepared in front of your eyes. They have a great variety of fillings. Pretty cheap and tasty 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,133,Delicious   We were headed to Torchy s because we were from out of town and we know Torchy s.  So glad we stopped and ventured in.  Long line but it moved fast.  Great burritos and queso.  Great service  too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,134,It s months later and I still remember my burrito from Cabo Bob s  I have NEVER had a better burrito  Everybody needs to stop here whether you live there or are just passing through like I was. I am so sad that I can t get this where I live. Enjoy it Austin 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,135,After reading other reviews of it being too crowded inside and the fact the pandemic is still happening we decided curbside pickup was the best option and it was so yummy  the reviews were right no one was social distancing so overall picking up was great decision 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,136,Definitely 100 times better than any other burrito place out there. Way better than Chipotle or Free Birds. You can get a free entree if you make 6 purchases. Also  they let you mix two different burrito flavors. I highly recommend the Smokey Cheddar Ancho Chile tortilla and a side of Chipotle sauce to pour on your burrito.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,137,This place is delicious. And cheap. For  6-7 you can get three tacos or a huge burrito. The place is set up chipotle style where you can customize your meal thru the line. They also have a menu with ingredients listed if you re not picky and don t feel like picking and choosing thru all the choices of fixings. I got the Baja fish tacos and the flavor was great  they put a good amount of fish  and the tortillas held up the weight of all the fixings. Water was free and drinks cost extra. The only problem we had was with the service. I called ahead to see if our dog could come and the man who answered said no dogs were allowed. A friend told us he s seen dogs there before so we took a gamble and when we got there a lady worker told us it was perfectly ok. The parking lot is also small so I would suggest street neighborhood parking.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,138,This place is an Austin staple. It s fast  causal and close to the UT campus. They have fresh pressed tortillas offered in 4 different flavors  tacos  burritos and bowls. I personally always get fish tacos or a bowl. The servings are generous and the service is quick. The sauces are delicious. I like the kick in the extra hot sauce  Perfect to spice up my entree. All of this for under  10  you can t beat it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,139,The food s good but you could find better places somewhere else. Also  we were able to make tacos just like theirs. It s just like Chipotle or Freebirds.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,140,Good tacos  burritos  and bowls  but the line at this particular location is ridiculous during lunch dinner hours - especially when UT has a game or during graduations.  The one on Ben White would be a better option . 4 star for food  3 for location and wait. Parking is tough during lunch dinner.  Fish tacos are their signature  but their chicken is actually really great. Mango pico is on point.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,141,You absolutely have to come here if you re really hungry. Like you ve probably heard  this place is basically the same concept as Chipotle  where you choose the ingredients that go into your bowl burrito. Unlike Chipotle  which gives you more food if you get the bowl  Cabo Bob s actually gives you more if you get the burrito. In other words  get the burrito if you re choosing between that or a bowl.  Everyone says the ingredients here taste fresher than Chipotle s and it really did feel like they were. If you come here you have to get the fish  like when you choose your meat at Chipotle  except fish isn t an option there  cause that s the best. Fish tacos are just amazing. But really though. Solid option over Chipotle. Just wish it was closer to campus 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,142,One of my all-time favorite restaurants in Austin. Cabo Bob s is like Chipotle but 1000000x better  seriously. Get a burrito bowl with queso on top and you ll be in heaven. It s usually my first stop when I land.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,143,My friend is notorious for having the worst palate. His favorite restaurant is CiCi s Pizza  birthday celebrations have taken place here AS AN ADULT . He once said he would take a girl out on a first date to McDonald s  and let her order off the non-value menu.     As you can see  I was skeptical when he told me that Cabo Bob s is legit. Plus  with its location in West Campus  which is generally known for average but overpriced food  I was thinking this might be a trap.   All my doubts vanished when I walked up to the front of the line. I was asked to pick a tortilla flavor. Cilantro tomatillo  please. The guy plops down little colorful balls of dough on the tortilla press and flips them around until they re slightly browned. Yes  Their tortillas are freshly made  And it makes a WORLD of a difference in taste. The rest of the line is done Chipotle-style- customize ingredients to your liking. Let me be clear  I despise Chipotle and would have to be paid to eat there  but this place is higher quality  way fresher  and tastier.   I selected the deluxe fish tacos  and told them to put everything on it. Mango pico  guacamole  cabbage  2 generous pieces of fried fish  all wrapped in a warm  soft tortilla. This is no ordinary fish taco. This is a fish taco I d eat every day for the rest of my life.   Looks like my friend upped his food game  so I ll have to give him more credit. Seriously  the tortillas are bomb. I don t want to waste any more time trying to convince you. JUST GO GET YOU SOME.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,144,Tiny burritos  super inconsistent. Picture of my burrito next to a normal size lighter for reference.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,145,I love cabo  probably the best burrito place in austin  and there s a good reason why. It s not only delicious but you get your money s worth. The restaurant is similar to chipotle in that you pick every ingredient in your burrito. You can also request a bowl or a tortilla. What s unique is that the dough for the tortillas is pretty much cooked in front of you. They compress it in some machine and then cook it on some large circular heated rotating disk.  I normally get the cilantro tortilla  which is the green colored dough  and always add fish as my meat. Without fail  I have never been disappointed by these selections. The burrito costs like  9 dollars  but you ll be so full. The one gripe I have is that sometimes they rip the tortilla when they wrap the burrito so eating it becomes really messy for me. They did this last time I was here.  Parking can be a little bit of a challenge as the lot is pretty cramped. Other than that  the ambiance is nice. You shouldn t have trouble finding seats as you can always go outside if the inside of the building is a little cramped.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,146,Wow  Out of all the reviews I have written  I can t believe I forgot to do this one  well now it s about time I write about it   Cabo Bob s is out of this world. Whether you come for the first time or the thousandth time  Cabo Bob s will never fail you. They have a delicious assortment of meats  veggies  toppings and tortilla selections. This place is way better than Chipotle...or Freebirds...or anything alike   When you first go  you smell the Mexican flavors from the rice and beans to their delicious fish  oh my goodness  it s like an addiction  you can t ever have enough fish . If this your first time going  please order the fish. I don t care if it s in a taco or a burrito  just get the fish. That is all I have to say about that.  My usual run down for this burrito creation is these steps  Half and half tortilla with Tomatillo and Cheddar  White Rice  Black Beans  Fish  Grilled Onions  Zucchini  Cheese  Lettuce  Pico de Gallo  Cilantro  Cabbage  Mango Salsa  Chipotle Crema and Limes on the side.  Give it a try  It s definitely the best mexican burritos in town  and located in North Campus 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,147,Two words  FISH TACOS.  Wow. These are delicious.  But so are the rest of their tacos   I love this place. Every ingredient is delicious and the atmosphere is chill.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,148,I come here a few times a week  it is so very good.  Everything is delicious  the portions are huge and the service is fast.   Be sure to get a frequent burrito card to get a free burrito after you rack up enough punches 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,149,There is no better place to get a burrito than Cabo Bobs. Anything you get is 5 Stars and there s nothing else to say.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,150,Mediocre. It looks awesome with the freshly made tortillas but the food tastes bland. Wish the fish was available grilled too  would be better than fried alone.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,151,O M G. If you haven t been to this place you have to go    My sister has been telling me for months this place is better than other burrito places and she is definitely right. They have so many options and THEY MAKE THEIR OWN TORTILLAS right when you order -- game changer. All the ingredients are amazing  the meat is so juicy  and they have several veggies options. The line was out the door when we got there for a late lunch but the line moved quickly and it was definitely worth it. I can t wait to go back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,152,I ve been to this Cabo Bobs 5 or 6 times and everything I ve ordered has been great. The meat is always perfectly cooked  and the non-meats are always fresh. Imagine like a much better version of Chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,153,Beware   Even though it says west campus  cabo bobs is pretty far  do not plan on walking from on UT   Bwfore you order  you can see how they make their taco and chips  and it was really interesting to watch  Cabo bobs is a typical pick your own food type of restaurant  very similar to chipotle. They are well known for their fried fish. I ordered a burrito with fried fish and it was HUGE. The fish was crispy and crunchy and their hot sauce and the rice balanced each other out well. They are very generous with their servings and the meal feels slightly more nutritious then your average fast food restaurant. I would definitely come back to try the fish tacos next time 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,154,Was in town and chose this place on a whim.  O.M.G YOU GUYS   They make their tortillas fresh  right in front of your F  amp  ING FACE      I told this to my 9 year old nephew and he said  Like  they crush the wheat   No  they don t crush the wheat  but they DO CRUSH IT     So you can pick from 3-4 flavors of tortilla. They have the dough balls ready then they press them flat and huge  then throw them on a rotating gridle and cook them up. Do you know how fantastic it is to watch your tortilla get all bubbly and griddled  F  amp  ING FANTASTIC     I had some kind of pork  sorry  don t remember because my mind was blown by the tortillas  with white rice  baja beans     and other delightful fillings  like the squash zucchini - YUM    It was huge and delicious and I kept telling myself to STOP EATING but I just couldn t   Carb overload  but totally worth it.   P.S. I had the green tortilla - Tomatillo  amp  Cilantro I think  So yum.  F CK IT  I never give Five Stars  but it s been over a week and I m still dreaming about those damn tortillas. Tomatillo and CRACK is more like it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,155,This place can be hard to find  but it s pretty close to University of Texas. This place is made for the adventurous burrito lover. They have a variety of tortillas to choose from  proteins  and extra fillings. To me  this place is pretty much an upgraded Chipotle because it is the same concept but so so SO much better. I ordered a crispy fish burrito with a cilantro tortilla  avocado  and other fix-ins. My boyfriend ordered a brisket burrito with queso that was also amazing. Their burritos are also so fat  they can be eaten for both lunch AND dinner. If you re looking for amazing  cheap food...you should definitely come here 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,156,Satisfying burritos made out of very fresh ingredients  amp  especially fun is that the tortillas are freshly baked to your liking. Enough to keep you full for the whole day  amp  happy on top 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,157,Thank you Cabo Bob s  for being my little piece of paradise in Austin  I m a sucker for a killer fish taco and you can definitely find that here. I love that the tortillas are made to order. So  The chips are perfect and thick  they hold up great for dipping so you have to try the chips  amp  queso  I love this place and can t wait to come back 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,158,Every time I go to Austin  I always make time  to make a visit here  I ordered  6  which is brisket fajita burrito  but I don t get all the add-ins. I always drench it with the hot sauce they have   My only complaint is that they don t give enough meat...my whole burrito was filled with rice  It s sad  but I still come back  It s just like another chipotle restaurant but with more variety. At first I didn t really like it  but I m definitely hooked now. My favorite thing to order here is the chips and queso   Oh my gosh this is the best thing here   The chips are so fresh and are just one of a kind. I always ask for a refill on the chips and cheese  usually they don t charge me  if I m lucky . To top it all off  I always order a Mexican coke. It s literally just the best drink to eat with the burrito and queso  It compliments so well    I definitely recommend it  And if anything  ALWAYS order the chips and queso   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,159,ONE WORD  ERASMO            He is the most wonderful person. After picking up our orders and realizing we were missing a couple items  we called back to be greeted by his warmth and willingness to listen. He gave us corrected orders immediately. Rarely do you meet someone who makes you feel so special as a customer.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,160,High quality ingredients. Everything was freshly made  the tortillas  the salsa  the pico di gallo. The portions were HUGE  especially for the price. The burrito was just so bland  I got steak with brown rice  looked like cilantro in the rice  black beans  grilled onions  salsa  guac  pico and cilantro on a cilantro tomatillo tortilla. It should have been flavorful. But it just wasn t.  The meat didn t have any flavor. The salsa and pico and guac didn t have any flavor. Maybe if I had gotten it with queso it would have helped  A different meat  Everyone raves about these burritos and I was just so disappointed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,161,It s good. They make their burritos fresh which is a huge plus. There s a big parking lot out front  so it s very easy to find a spot.   They have decent options for vegetarians  and everything tasted very fresh  I personally am not a fan of cilantro  and they put cilantro in almost everything  rice  salsas   so beware of that. However  the food was still delicious  You can even get burritos with two flavors  I recommend the cheddar .   Overall  it s a delicious and efficient place to get solid burritos close to UT campus.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,162,These people are the best - I come for lunch all the time and everyone is super nice and serve you fast. I ve had pretty much all the items on the menu. Everything is very good....  Plus the atmosphere has a great casual feel and they keep the place clean.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,163,This place is what burritos should be   They take fresh dough  then press and grill your tortilla of choice right there as you order.  The staff is always friendly and the food is amazing 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,164,Love this place  Been coming here since it opened  at original location off of Ben White   Freshest ingredients that are super delicious. Always a friendly staff - especially Beto who presses your tortillas 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,165,CABO BOB S IS THE BOMB   Hands down  best burrito place in Austin...Makes competitors like Chipotle  Qdoba  and Freebirds look like a joke.  You can get burritos  tacos  or salad bowl and even give you selection of different types of tortillas. The tortillas are made fresh right in front of you and they cook all their meats on Big Green Egg grills. They also have queso  salsas  and their own house made hot sauce.  They also do punch-cards so you can get a free burrito after 6 visits. HIGHLY RECOMMEND 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,166,Great spot not just food wise but the employees there make you feel like family. They really do. The cashier Brisa was doing such a great job  had a line to the door but she was always so polite and friendly. He had ordered a chips and guacamole  the people working were a little busy so they brought it out to us. As soon as we got it Brisa was quick to apologize on the delay but honestly there was no need to. We were always treated like family there and can understand if there s a little delay. When you are treated like that by a restaurant it feels so great  So thank you guys. Also Beto    The press guy such a great help  Made sure we got what we were looking for and gave us a couple suggestions that we will be trying out pretty soon  They love their job and it shows  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,167,I walked in the Anderson location last night craving a burrito and boy did I get that craving taken care of. I picked the Smokey cheese tortilla which is by far the best tortilla that I have ever had in my life and added lettuce  cheese  pinto beans  black beans queso plus that delicious fish their known for. Just simply a delicious meal for  8.60 you can t beat that anywhere. See you next week.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,168,Cabo is clearly the go-to burrito for students and one of the best in Austin. Everything is done right from the fresh pressed tortillas to the flavorful meats to the wide variety of toppings and sauces. There s also punch cards that make every 7th burrito free  which is a great deal if you frequent the area. Oh  and did I mention that the burritos are cheaper and larger than Chipotle s 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,169,This place is a tad bit farther from campus compared to chipotle or qdoba but it s totally worth it   There plenty of seating inside and outside.  I typically get either the burrito or the tacos because they make the tortillas right in front of you so you know it s super fresh  I normally go with the cilantro one. They also have fish which I know chipotle doesn t have and it s super delicious  The portion sizes are similar to chipotle so I definitely have leftovers.   If you re ever craving delicious tacos and burritos  come here  It s worth the distance  I m so sad they only have locations in Austin. Hopefully they ll expand to Dallas soon 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,170,If you are looking for the TGI Fridays of Tex Mex  come see Bob.   Everything is smothered in cheese - the crappy waxed coated pre-shredded kind from the grocery store.   I literally had 4 or 5 bites of my dinner as it was just a pile of melted cheese.  The guac and  homemade  chips were...okay at best.  Also - the Gluten free chips  yes we tried both options  tasted like old leaves.  They literally have a house birthday song - we had the unfortunate luck of hearing it three times that night.   As a tourist in Austin looking for TexMex  I was really disappointed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,171,This place is just amazing. I can t even tell you how many of my friends make this their first request when they come to Austin. They make the tortillas fresh in front of you-and this is one of the limited quick service places where I recommend the fish. Everything is fresh and it s always worth any line that s there.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,172,A good supplement to chipotle  I love the fact that you can pick your tortilla flavors which are made right in front of you. You can either pick the specials that already have the fix ins chosen for you or you can build your own creation- chipotle style. The battered fish is a great tasty meat choice. I order a salad  which comes with 2 tortillas of my choice  and then make my own little tacos. I like how there is more variety in the toppings and sauces also. For a quick and cheap dinner fix to fill you up  cabo bobs is an excellent choice  It will leave you with a happy wallet and tummy.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,173,This is a 5 star place for me  The authenticity of this restaurant should get all the credit it deserves  Think Chipotle but homemade tortillas and love in every bite  They have different type of uniquely flavored tortillas you can choose from  Buttermilk flour  Ancho Chili  Smokey Cheddar  or Cilantro Tomatillo. I tried the Cilantro Tomatillo and my boyfriend tried the Smokey Cheddar  we were both very satisfied with our choices  They are so delicious AND they put it on the hot surface for a few minutes so it is nice and warm and even has wee bit of a crisp once you bite into it  They have the similar assembly line like Chipotle where you pick your beans first  then rice  then protein  greens  and lastly sauces cheese. They have an option for beans that includes a variety of beans in it  I chose that and it was great  The burrito was so fat after they rolled it. That first bite sent me into a great time portal of when I used to eat Burritos in Mexico as a child  it also had a slight chimichanga taste which sent me into overdrive. It made the Latina in me want to get up and hug kiss every single person working in that kitchen  This place is authentically the bomb  Please do yourself a favor and try it  you will be back  I promise  and so will I.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,174,In the great Campus Burrito Battle of the 2010 s...   Qdoba never really stood a chance. Freebirds was plucky  but generally too stoned to challenge Chipotle s tinfoil throne.  Enter Cabo Bob.  The pinnacle of the fast casual burrito. End your search here. This is it.   Why   You know how GI Joe used to say  knowing is half the battle    The other half is home-made tortillas. Cabo Bob has them in four flavors.  Then your kind burrito-rista  burrista   loads the tortilla with a wide variety of veggies and stuff. It s all pretty damn good. As is the hot sauce.  The nationwide battle may still be raging  as Cabo Bobs only just opened their third location. But ended  the Campus Burrito Wars have.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,175,I cannot explain how good of a burrito this place really has    I really couldn t see myself getting any other burrito from anywhere else. The tortillas are actually incredible. If you actually think chipotle is better than Cabo bobs you legit have the tastebuds of a dog. If you ve never eaten here and you like chipotle come here once and you ll never go to chipotle every again and I put that on G
Cabo Bob's Burritos,176,I think that Cabo Bob s was really good and I really enjoyed the service there.  I would definitely go back there again. The parking there is pretty tight and there is a big lunch crowd  but the service was good and I think there ingredients are really fresh and I would say it is better than Freebirds. I like how they make their own tortillas right in front of you and the price is reasonable.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,177,Cabo Bob s... you are the reason why I will never eat chipotle again in my life. Your burritos amount to the size of a small child. The tortillas are fresh pressed and grilled to perfection. The fried fish is always hot and crispy inside the mound of my burrito. Your options for brown rice that still taste great makes me feel like I m being healthy. The options for saut ed squash  bell peppers  and onions is a mild surprise to a burrito. The mango salsa and the chipotle sauce are standouts from the traditional burrito fillings. The punch card is a gift to man kind as is the entire establishment. One burrito a day is all I need  and after 6 days I get a free one. Thank you for existing in my life.  Sincerely   Comatose Brian as a result of your heavenly burritos
Cabo Bob's Burritos,178,Great for a quick and affordable lunch  Always busy with college kids  expect a long line reaching the entrance. It s a bit of a walk from the UT campus  but very worth it.  The concept is like Chipotle and Freebirds  but Cabo Bob s is the best. There are so many choices and the ingredients are very fresh. Never disappointed when I come   I usually get a chicken burrito bowl. The chicken is tender and juicy. The fish tacos are also really good. I love their house-made sauces  especially the Ancho Rancho and the hot sauce.  I have been here multiple times and will definitely be back 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,179,We like to come here almost every week  My order is  1 come with 2 pieces of fishes tacos    I order you got 3 tacos  so awesome 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,180,So I was fairly disappointed by this place since it received such high praise and ratings. So I came across this place by word of mouth from a co-worker who works in the area. The first issue with this place is the location  it sits on UT s campus. Of course if your a student this is great but if you re a normal government employee it s too busy for a quick run for food. The food itself isn t bad cuts squarely in the middle of Chipotle Qdoba and Torchy s and here in lies my problem. They have no where near the flavor of Torchy s but have more customizability than Chipotle. Everything taste fresh which is awesome but the food is lacking that little punch you get from Torchy s. So if you want great tacos go to Torchy s if you want a great burrito or bowl go here or Qdoba only difference is this place maybe slightly healthier. So probably the real difference here is the food had more of a South West flair instead of the oh so familiar Tex Mex flavors which may be the welcome change you need.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,181,Probably the most popular spot for UT students to grab a quick meal. Their queso and tortillas are AMAZING. For all the counter-service restaurants  Chipotle  Qdoba  etc   Cabo Bobs definitely comes out on top. Usually pretty busy whenever I go but always worth the wait. If you aren t wanting a long wait  try going at a less busy time and avoid the post-football game rush. Also  they are closed on Sundays so hopefully you aren t craving a big burrito with queso then...  Check out their website  they have a great story and a fun-loving atmosphere. Also a great restaurant to cater for events.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,182,If there s one food item i m passionate about in Austin  TX  it is Cabo Bob s burritos. Think everything that makes Chipotle  Freebirds  or other build-your-own burrito places good  and make it exponentially better  and you have Cabo Bobs. Incredible queso  pico  all their meat is cooked on a Big Green Egg. Their Red 66 sauce really pulls it all together. Cabo Bob s is a must have.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,183,Can t beat the handmade tortillas  and different flavors  here. I recommend a mix of the cilantro tomatillo and ancho chili. Definitely go 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,184, 1  Tasty.  2  Brown rice available   Take that  Freebirds.  3  Vegan burrito on the menu.   No need to ask for it special.   4  Long lines   lunch and dinnertime are a plus or minus depending on your perspective.   Plus b c it popularity suggests quality.   5  They made an in-kind donation to my kid s school.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,185,Capsule review  Cabo Bob s offers good variety and  value to make it a solid player in an Austin market overflowing with taco and burrito choices. Full review below.  At first  I was simply ignorant of Cabo Bob s existence  and afterward I merely ignored it. It s just too far to casually walk from my campus building for lunch  and  given that Chipotle satisfies my chain burrito needs  I assumed it wouldn t be worth the effort.  But lo and behold  Yelp intervened. I saw 4.5 stars  and considered the possibility of a hidden gem. And a hidden gem it is  I almost dropped the five-bomb on it  but some hitches are keeping me at four. I ll be back to reconsider  though.  Nothing about the look of the place promises much  it s like a discount Joe s Crab Shack on the inside  with nautical murals on the walls and wooden tables meant to resemble reclaimed ship wood. There s a huge outdoor picnic-bench area as well for braving the heat. Still  I kinda hate the all-things-Cancun ethos  so I was a little leery.  Service concept is that Subway-inspired DIY assembly line. They have ten preset burrito options  plus tacos and sides   if you re in a hurry or choice frightens you  or the build-your-own. There are four yummy tortillas to pick from  pressed and roasted right in front of you. Just the tortilla alone made me quietly vow to divorce Chipotle  but the fact that you can get fried fish helped as well. I went with brown rice  a mix of black and pinto beans  fish  sauteed poblanos  two salsas and some guac. They have two additional hot sauces on pumps by the drink fountain.  Not only was the burrito excellent  I could have split it with someone and walked away full. My will to overeat was overwhelmed  and I threw away a quarter of it despite its fresh-tortilla-fishy-burrito goodness. And before I added the guac  this log of food was only going to be  6.99. Damns.   Staff were super friendly  although it looked as if service had gone a little off the rails as the manager ran some orders to people standing around waiting  I was nearly handed someone else s food  side cups had run out at the condiment stand  etc. Everything was fixed  but the shift could maybe have run a little more smoothly.   Still Cabo Bob s is an easy keeper  and also  forgive the alliteration  very viable  for vegetarians and vegans--you won t leave this one hungry.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,186,I keep wondering what makes this place so special and I ve determined that it s definitely something about the tortillas  Fresh and full of flavor  they make the meal. Ask for a stamp card  otherwise they don t give you one 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,187,Actually the best place ever like I don t know how I lived without CB before college. Better than chipotle by farrrr
Cabo Bob's Burritos,188,Best burrito I ve had in Austin. All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty and the burrito doesn t fall apart in your hand. It s a better quality Chipotle Qdoba. Those places have been ruined by these burritos. Highly recommend as a place to eat
Cabo Bob's Burritos,189,No idea what the hoo-ha is about. A true experience in mediocrity. Service was good  selections seemed good- however-the tacos  amp  burritos were 50 shades of bland  with toppings to match. Nothing to taste here folks. Will come again if nothing else is open.    Addendum  I did take the leftovers with me. Courtesy of being extremely poor while I bide my time as a gypsy before succumbing to a job again  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,190,What makes Cabo Bob s different from Chipotle or Qdoba  Sure  Cabo is a little farther up north but it s well worth the trek for students due to their freshly made tortillas  variety of tortilla choices  variety of meats  including fried fish  and toppings  including mango pico or whatever that is    The fresh quality of their food and the abundance of options make Cabo Bob s a top contender for a fast burrito taco bowl.   You can t go wrong with picking a premade order number off the wall  like fish tacos  or just making your own as your eyes do all the choosing for you as you walk down the eye. And be sure to speak up so the workers can hear you because it can get loud in here    Definitely snag a punch card here. They don t make you reach the double digits before they reward you. In fact  you could probably eat here every day and then get a free meal on the weekend.   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,191,This is a Gem  Large portions  unbelievably low prices  and fresh Tex-led made right in front of you. I fed three people for  26  I ordered the Fish tacos and they were nothing short of delicious and fresh  The salsa is not as spicy as I usually prefer  but the variety of fresh toppings gives it all the flavor 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,192,This University burrito shop is a true hidden gem  though I can t figure out why. So few of the people with whom I ve talked food have heard of Bob s  but with freshly made tortillas for your burrito right in front of your eyes  it s a must visit on any  ATXFoodie tour. Oh  and the sauce  CrayCrayGrayt from their hot sauce to their slightly sweet salsa verde  it s a perfect complement. Oh yes  chips. Hell yes. Fresh fresh crispy fresh.  We ve had the pork  the veggie  both fish and the chicken so far. We will make it through the whole menu of specials before end of next month.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,193,The burritos are really good. They are usually very large and the tortillas are home made. Always a good meal when you are really hungry.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,194,Best fish tacos IN LIFE EVER...cooked to order home made tortillas...omgggg  what more could you ask for     Great customer service  Mmmmm   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,195,Cabo Bob s takes Chipotle to a whole new world.  From the variety of fresh made tortillas to the large amount of stuffings  you really can t beat this place.  Not only are they very friendly but they also make every item extremely filling and for a great price. I got three different tacos and they were all massive.  I am definitely coming back here again 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,196,I had never had Cabo Bob s until it was catered at Healing with Horses Ranch s volunteer appreciation party.  I really liked all the fresh ingredients  Pico  Chicken  Beef  Tortillas...  The chips and queso where so addictive 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,197,Chipotle who  I went to Austin with my friends and decided to eat here on a whim. Honestly  the best decision that we made bc this place is a bang for your buck  They re very versatile and you are given the choice of a bowl  tacos  or burrito  love that  . It s very filling and tasty. Highly recommend 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,198,Great taste on the build a burrito I had the fish and it was delicious nice and crisp just the way I would ve done it if I had made it myself hope to visit again soon
Cabo Bob's Burritos,199,The food here is pretty good  but the workers ruin the experience. The food wrapping is gross  and they do a poor job at it. Makes me angry looking at it  and makes me not want to eat it. Don t ever to-go from here or you will regret it. Not worth the money i paid to get a burrito this quality. All exploded. I d rather go to chipotle for a cheaper price.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,200,Came here on my younglife team retreat and these are the responses from some of the members of the team  Alex  this was my high school experience. It s so good.  Logan  I was hungry and it was food Madi  so yummy I ate my tacos really fast Joy  the tacos and nachos were really good   Lauren  loved the tortillas Zac  solid pepper sauce loved the extra kick Tres  if any place has homemade tortillas I m in Come here    Great place for yummy food and good convo  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,201,These are some big ass burritos  I didn t choose much filling to go in my burrito but the burrito still ended up being humongous. The guy in front of me got almost every filling and his burrito was on the verge of rupturing but what I love about this place is that they press their tortillas right in front of your eyes and cook it on a heating plate so you can see the tortilla bubble and brown up. For the filling  I recommend you definitely get the mango salsa and chipotle sauce because they add a nice and fresh spicy kick to the burrito. This place is the same concept as chipotle and free birds but they have a nice selection of burrito fillings including zucchini   Which I really liked  so I would definitely recommend coming here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,202,This place was so filling   I got the bowl with two tortillas and it was enough to take home to make it a second meal  I highly recommend eating it soon though because it will go bad if you leave it for too long  I will make sure to stop by the next time I m in Austin to try there fried fish 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,203,Incredible food at an incredible price. This place is easily one of the best deals in Austin. The service is fast and the homemade tortillas are amazing and the portions are giant. What more is there to say 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,204,Bad ass taco and burrito joint. Get this... They cook your tortilla made to order in front of you. Not heat it up like chipotle. When you order the flavor tortilla you want. They slap a ball of raw dough onto a revolving grille. It puffs up like a ballon then get to filling my friend. The rest of the show is much like chipotle but a little more creative.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,205,really good fish tacos  great queso. ask for extra chipotle crema on the tacos for even more flavor
Cabo Bob's Burritos,206,I ve been to Cabo bobs at least a dozen times over the last year and the quality has dropped every time I ve been. I would have given it 5 stars after my first 2 visits. I like how they press the tortillas fresh and I ve had no problems with their structural integrity until recently. The last 3 times give been the burritos have fallen apart instantly. I always order online so I don t see them make it.   The worst part is that they took the best meat they have off of the menu about a month ago  the bacon ground beef. That was one of the best burrito fillings I ve ever had. I ve since tried every meat other than the fish and they re all mediocre. The steak I had was dry and there is nothing to say about the chicken.   Bottom line  worth a try but I would avoid ordering online if you want your food made correctly.  Edit  I go there so often because I pass by this place every day
Cabo Bob's Burritos,207,Beat burrito place on the planet. Very cool option for what you can get here. Very healthy. Laid back atmosphere. A must try
Cabo Bob's Burritos,208,Fresh tortillas cooked right in front of you. Friendly staff and lots of seating. One of the best burritos I ve had. Everything is so fresh and they have so many ingredients to choose from. The punch card is also a great deal 6 burritos and you get one free 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,209,I ordered lunch today from the one on Anderson lane and Shoal Creek today for the company I work for  Austin s Communication Station It was easy to order and amazing food. Very reasonably priced. Our company will use them again.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,210,Holy Amazing   Chipotle is usually my go to   would order from them once a week    but my friend told me about Cabo Bob s  and I knew I had to give it a try.This is during Covid-19 so we ordered pick up online. The online ordering was easy and  straight forward- our order was ready within 10 minutes. The gentleman who brought out our order was very friendly and efficiently. I usually get burrito bowls or salad but I knew I had to try a burrito from Cabo Bob s and I am so happy I did . First off  the size of the burrito is HUGE. It was bigger than my bicep. I got two meals out of it   and the leftover was still  super good reheated in the oven . I love the large variety of toppings they offer- they have fresh jalape os as a topping option too   The mango salsa was a super yummy addition to the burrito  you can also tell the tortilla is fresh and made in house . We also got the chips and queso. The chips were super crispy and fresh and I liked how they didn t overdue the salt on it as many other places tend to do that . The queso was delicious - better than chipotle in my opinion. Cannot wait to get cabo bobs again   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,211,Learned of this place 8 years ago  have since become loyal to their hot sauce  driving from Houston TX twice a year to purchase the LARGE bottles 2 at a time. Today  the tacos were great  but no supply on hoy sauce. Thanks to a kind manager who.heard my desperation and filled a large to.go bowl to tide me overuntil we come back.  We.love Cabo Bob s
Cabo Bob's Burritos,212,The fish tacos are great  The prices and portions are very good 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,213,The tortillas are made to order which makes them head and shoulders better than any other tortilla spot in town. In an effort to cut calories  I often opt for a bowl at Chipotle but I just can t say no to a made-in-front-of-me tortilla 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,214,This place has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat a quick lunch. I always get the crispy fish tacos  which have never disappointed me.   I m always skeptical of new places when I already have similar restaurants as favorites  but this quickly became  1 on the list. I m always craving the crispy fish tacos. The only downside is the location. I live all the way on MLK so if I decide to walk here  it takes quite some time. I normally drive if I m too lazy. The parking lot has many parking spots so that s always a plus.  If you haven t tried this place  I would highly recommend it  You definitely won t regret it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,215,Huge portions and everything is tasty. Basically  only burritos  but lots of options. Kind of like a gourmet Chipotle  but quality and price are better. I wonder if all the college kids who eat there appreciate the place - yeah  I guess they do  Given the numbers. Probably best to come at an off time.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,216,This is one of my favorite places for lunch in Austin. They give you a great discount on your order if you re in the military  and it doesn t matter if you re dining in or getting it to go. Let me say it is one of the best discounts in town.  The concept is about the same as Chipotle  but Cabo Bob s is way more festive and has way more choices for tacos  burritos  burrito bowls  and the service is much better. I will put up with the complete lack of good parking  its very awkward location  and its always busy and bustling atmosphere just to get lunch here  I usually get fish tacos with all 3 different flavored flour tortillas  or a burrito bowl with shredded pork or something. I also get their very tasty chips and salsa. Be mindful there are two salsa choices  red and green  and that green sauce is really spicy  Definitely a great place for lunch whether you re dining in or out.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,217,Great burritos and tacos mainly for their tortilla choices. Nacho Chili  Smokey Cheddar  cilantro tomatillo  and buttermilk flour. This trip I got three tacos and my husband got a burrito. Both were good however previous times have been more filled with toppings. I think it may be because line was long and they were in a rush to get everyone s orders. We went on Friday night after winter break so the line was out the door with college students. Usually it s not too loud with reggae music playing but once the college students are back there s a lot of commotion.  Still one out favorite places to get burritos in Austin.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,218,Wow  Been coming in once or more weekly for almost 6 months and nothing has been bad. The staff and management are great and the flavor and quality of food is very consistent and reliable. I work in culinary and it s great to have a place that I can grab dinner when I m too tired to cook for myself. My advice is they shouldn t change a thing  unless it s to take care of the employees who are making Cabo Bob s Burritos a winner. I notice that restaurants that retain long term employees usually have better and more consistent food and customer service. Cabo Bob s Burritos seems to get this and I hope they keep it that way 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,219,First time customer and will certainly be coming back  Fish burrito was as big as my head  The cheddar tortilla was perfect  Great atmosphere
Cabo Bob's Burritos,220,Cabo Bob s never disappoints  Their ingredients are always fresh and their tortillas are honestly the best in town. I love that you can customize everything and make it healthy if you want to. I could eat there everyday  Just wish they were open on Sundays 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,221,Cabo Bob s is my go to taco place for fish tacos. I come here alllll the time but I never took the chance to write a review. Every time I come here the fish tacos are crispy and hot  I like that they have different types of tortillas  buttermilk flour  ancho chili  smokey cheddar  or cilantro tomatillo  you can choose from. I could eat Cabo Bobs for a whole week in a row  I have  with no regrets. Will stay a loyal customer 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,222,This place is da bomb. I have been eating at CB for years now. The Rio Grande store is always so friendly and helpful. The food is always on point and the queso is definitely the best in Texas. I wouldn t call it a meal  it s an experience. From the aesthetically pleasing atmosphere  to the food  to the people  this is my favorite restaurant in Austin. 10 stars out of 5  would eat here again.  PS. Management must be doing something right.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,223,I was really excited to give this place a try after hearing about their fresh tortillas. While their tortillas did not disappoint  other aspects did disappoint. Set up like Chipotle  I made my own chicken burrito with veggies  beans  lettuce  and pico. The staff was kind  patient  and even rewrapped my burrito with a new tortilla after it busted open. The burrito was the size of a 8 lb baby.  Okay  maybe not  but it was huge. Refer to the photo with my hand for reference.  The burrito size definitely adds points for the bang for your buck. But the seasoning of the ingredients in the burrito fell flat. It was quite bland. Thinking some of the guacamole from my guacamole and chips order could zest it up  I transferred some to my burrito. No luck. Although I would give this place another try for affordability  it is not a meal I will ever crave.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,224,DISCLAIMER  This review is solely based on the fish burrito.  Fresh tortillas   Check.  Huge burritos   Oh yes.  Good prices   Thumbs up   The style of ordering at Cabo Bob s is similar to that of Chipotle.  The main difference is that their four different kinds of tortillas is made to order and you can feel and taste the difference.  There s also a lot of variety in their toppings and sauces  which makes the experience all the more exciting.  What brings my rating down is their fried fish.  At first  I was hesitant to try it since I feel that frying a fish is cheating  seafood snob alert .  But in the end  I decided to give it a shot since it received so many compliments.  However  the fried fish just didn t impress.  Its flavor was a bit bland and tasted like any fried fish from a fast food restaurant.  Maybe I got them from a bad batch.  Maybe I got the very last aged pieces of fish from the bottom of the container.  Who knows   But if I do come back  I ll probably try their brisket or their beef burrito instead.  I won t let this one experience define my perception of this place  but if I could  I would give it 3.5 stars.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,225,Lemme start by saying this. Tortillas were phenomenal. I don t know if I like the flavor combo and the cheese and cilantro tortilla. Other than that  I love that they offer fish too 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,226,I ordered Cabo Bob s catering for an event at work and I was super impressed  It was so easy to order and they were able to accommodate everything we needed. Gluten free  vegan  and vegetarian options. Delivery was on time and setup for us  super helpful . We had a taco bar and it was DELICIOUS  I am super impressed overall with quality  service  and cost. Will definitely be using Cabo Bob s for future catering needs  Thank you 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,227,I don t know why anyone even goes to chipotle anymore. No just kidding I do  it s much closer to campus... But seriously  if you want a cheap  quick  and amazingly tasty burrito  don t go to chipotle  come here.  Why do I like this place so much    1  They appealed to the inner child in me  is that a tortilla press   WOW it made the dough ball flat  WOW now it s spinning and cooking      1.5  No but seriously  fresh tortillas make such a difference. This coming from someone who usually opts for the bowl.  2  Fresh ingredients with flavors that taste home-made and warm and happy. I love how they season their proteins.  3  Queso. In the freaking burrito. Their queso is the bomb diggity.  4  The patio is adorable and perfect for nice weather outdoor eating.   5  PARKING LOT.  Come  it s worth it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,228,Now there are many a places these days that put Mexican flavors into one tantalizing dish  but this one is a local option.  Now I can t say that this is better then the others but the staff is the greatest.  As you may know I feel that the staff is an important part of the dining experience  but this is a fast food wait in line place  Having said that  EVERYONE from the person who took my order to the person who took my money wanted to make sure I got what I wanted.  I ordered a   8  but I m not a big fan of cilantro.  Not a big deal  just a preference.  They made a point of getting me some rice that didn t already have some in it. And every step of the way they wanted to make sure my taste buds got what they wanted. Alas  I got no names  but the staff who was working for the lunch crowd on Saturday December 10th kudos. Let s face it YOU RE the reason I ll be back  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,229,Satisfied  I always order their fish taco  one order comes in 3 tacos. This is my forth time here and I took with my family who are from OOT. Still thumbs up experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,230,Cabo Bob s food is great and their to-go packaging gives me peace of mind  but during COVID-19  they are not requiring patrons to wear masks unlike most other eateries. They do not even have a sign on the front door recommending it. Subsequently  of the 30 people I see in line  almost all college students  only a handful are wearing masks. I left promptly and placed an order for pickup online. I will not be entering the restaurant again until I know that customers are wearing masks and taking precautions out of respect for the community  even if they feel healthy and indestructible.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,231,This place hearkens back to my middle school glory days as that fat 6th grade kid on the middle school track team - days when I would get to enjoy a HUGE delicious burrito after a meet from Mission Burrito in Upper Kirby in Houston.  This place is as good as burrito places come  at least the ones I ve experienced .  This place is Chipotle on-roids - the degree of customizability  for your burrito is unparalleled by other Austin establishments  from four varieties of tortillas  to countless number of toppings  etc .  Most of all  everything is fresh.    Best of all  THEY HAVE FISH TACOS  which I would not have expected to find near campus.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,232,Want something that doesn t feel like a corporate burrito factory  Cabo Bob s is the spot. Awesome folks like Theresa  Elliot  and Sarai are ready to get you great food with a smile and good conversation. Thank you all and John for reminding me how fun and delicious this place is 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,233,Good fattening burritos. Brisket  carnitas  other good meats and stuff. The pop machine has Cane Imperial Sugar flavored pops  including a variant of dr pepper  i think its called Dr Baja. All kinds of sugary goodness. Or you can have iced tea.   Has a patio. Staff is usually friendly. Only a couple retards working there. Its usually clean. Bathrooms are cool. About the parking  Im not sure  I usually park at the laundromat and come here while my clothes are washing.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,234,Cabo Bob s is an excellent lunch spot in west campus  They have ample parking and seating  the food is fresh and they always have friendly service. For just  8.49 I got 3 DELUXE FISH TACOS that were filling and juicy.   A lot of people compare this place to chipotle  but I feel like the fried fish tacos are what make this place distinct.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,235,Love this place   Super good and I go all the time  One request- pls no more carrots in the squash zucchini  otherwise amazing in every way
Cabo Bob's Burritos,236,Absolutely love this place.  The food is always fresh  portioned well and so very tasty.  The staff are always pleasant and attentive.  The restaurant itself is clean and inviting. I wouldn t change a thing 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,237,Service  Every time I go to Cabo s  there s always a long line  because it s good food AND close to campus   however  they re very great at getting you through the line in a timely manner.   Ambiance  Very upbeat and chill place to eat at. Plenty of tables to accommodate for small and large groups.  Food  I ve tried pretty much everything they have to offer in a taco form. Hands down - crispy fish tacos  3 tacos per order    whatever toppings you prefer   chipotle crema   fresh lime on the side. The chipotle crema is a must  I ve ordered the crispy fish taco without it once and I hated myself for it. Disclaimer  it s good without the chipotle crema  but it s life-changing with it and this is coming from a person who dislikes creamy sauces 99  of the time. If I had to pick at one thing  then it s probably the tortilla because I prefer a fluffy corn tortilla  but it s nothing that ll stop me from coming. If you like spicy  DEFINITELY try their Red Hot Sauce and or XXtra Red Hot Sauce. I d recommend spooning it into your food in case you don t like it it s too spicy. I eat really  really  really spicy so the XXtra Red Hot is only a kick for me. To help you gauge the spicy level -  the spiciest  at an Americanized Thai food place is a barely a kick to me.  Overall  If you re in the area  definitely stop by. It s great food and a good portion for less than  10 - mine is always less than  8  In my  I breathe tacos  opinion  of all the taco places within the WEST Campus area  Cabo s definitely tops them all. If you think otherwise  please let me know because I would love to find an excuse to try a new taco place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,238,WOW   This is like a more mom-and-pop form of Chipotle. My friend Morgan  who goes to UT Austin  took me here singing all the praises of a college student looking for a solid burrito bowl. You can get their specials or build your own burrito and watch it all come to fruition. What shame they re only in Austin 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,239,Finally I reached a day with no leftovers where I could try one of my bookmarked Yelp spots and I decided it was between Cabo Bob s or Gourdough s Public House for a Donut burger with bacon  cheese  mayo and a fried egg  and I decided to put the coronary on the backburner for now.  I m glad I saw this place on the front page here as it was awesome  fairly priced  and who doesn t love fresh tacos   I love that you can choose your tortilla flavors and not only for the big burrito tortillas.  I opted for the Ancho Chile  Smoky Cheddar  and Cilantro Tomatillo tortillas with the brisket  fajita chicken and shredded pork tacos.  I loaded up with grilled poblano peppers  onions  lettuce  pico  and tried 3 different sauces as well.  Basically everything sounded good  so I had one of everything.  The tortillas are freshly made  and flattened on a machine that is what the trash compactor on the Death Star wishes it had been.  It gets those bad boys thin and quickly so before they throw it on a griddle to cook until they are slightly crisp and still pliable.  You then load up with a variety of fresh toppings of your choosing.   All the veggies looked fresh and appealing  and the meat was moist and flavorful.  There were ample sauces to choose from as well.  I d say the fajita chicken was my favorite meat as it had that great grilled charred chicken flavor  along with maybe the smoky cheddar or ancho chile tortilla which were super fresh tasting  nicely flavored and made a huge difference to the overall taco.  After I finished eating  I debated going immediately back into line to try the beef fajita and crispy fish tacos as well  but refrained for another visit.    I ll definitely be back 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,240,Wow  this location surpassed the old location. If I could give it 6 stars I would.  Yes  while the food quantity they give is less than the location down on Ben White  let me tell you the one reason why this place has really set itself apart in the lives of college students and makes an already Cabo enthusiast jump for further joy  UMeTime. For those of you who don t know what this app is  basically at different time intervals throughout the day  they blast out deal specials for various restaurants near campus. Well looks like Cabo Bob s hopped onto that list because they have some really awesome deals  BOGO burritos occasionally  taco  chips combos  food item   drinks...yesterday I got 3 fish tacos and a drink for  5.49. That s right with tax that s under  6. It s not like Cabo Bob s was pricey to begin with  always been affordable and filling  but getting a drink thrown in for that really just puts it over the top.  Fuel for the journey eh  Gonna be making a lot of pit stops here then.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,241,Arnold invited me back to give them another try and I m glad I did.   The counter staff was super helpful with suggestions and I ve found  my  burrito  so to speak.   Ancho chile tortilla  cilantro lime rice  BBQ brisket  cheese  salsa  and 66 Red Xxtra Hot.  And some more 66 Red Xxtra Hot when you bring the burrito to the table.  The food was definitely better than my last visit and I credit the presence of management ownership for a good chunk of that.   It s a pleasure supporting a local business that wants to make things right.   Today  my burrito was made right and I had the opportunity to meet some of the management team.  Definitely a local business worth supporting.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,242,I absolutely love cabo bob s. starting from the location  right off rio grande is a good central location. because it is so central the parking situation sucks. during high traffic times  lunch and what not  your parking can be a little stressful. now once you have parked  well its only up hill from there. as soon as you walk in the menu is visible. as you stand in line contemplating what you want to eat  so see people walk off with food and then you taste buds start watering. you also get ideas as to what looks good and what you don t want. finally you are at the tortilla guy. you chose  I chose a bowl  they are starting to grow on me..........then I pick white rice  then a meat  then some beans  and so on and so on and they make it fit all so perfectly. if you are on a diet  they have healthy options. if you are on a budget  go to McDonalds. so I get my bowl and I pay. now seating is tricky because its not wait to be seated its a first come first serve. which means you may have to sit in a booth  table or bar table. if you aren t picky then you will have a spot to sit. larger groups I suggest as soon as you walk in start finding a seating area. my hubby usually get chips on the side to eat with his bowl. good idea if you don t think the bowl will fill you up. listen to me when I say.............Cabo bob s is the truth. GO. you wont be disappointed. last reason I love this place.............THE MUSIC JAMZ lol
Cabo Bob's Burritos,243,Best burritos on campus. I fell in love with this place ever since the first time I came. Great service  nice people  and a chill atmosphere.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,244,Cabo Bob s is one of the best burritos in the world. I ve been here so often I ve lost count of the punch cards I ve made it through. I recently moved away from Austin and the Cabo Bob s is one of my biggest cravings...  The can t stop won t stop eating good  - FRESH TORTILLAS. OH MY GOD. - Fried fish is on the spot - Hot sauce is absurdly good  The bad  - Lines can get a bit long - Cashier can get judgmental if it s your 2nd meal of the day there  Some tips and tricks  - Mix tortillas  yes you can do this . I usually get a half ancho chili half smokey cheddar for a burrito. - Half  amp  half meats usually yields more quantity - Buy tortillas by themselves to-go
Cabo Bob's Burritos,245,Very tasty tacos and burritos. Their tortilla have great flavor. My favorite is anchor chilly. Compared to Torches and Taco Joint which are more TexMex like flavor  Cabo Bob s is SoCal style.  The punch card gives 1 more meal for every 6  must be used in your next visit .
Cabo Bob's Burritos,246,We flew 1200 miles and this was our first stop and it did not disappoint. We had the Deluxe tacos and brisket burritos and they were phenomenal  Fountain drinks were not traditOnalaska in that we has the old time cream soda and the peach soda. Winning 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,247,A great experience. Staff is very friendly  atmosphere is on point  as a company they are very charitable  the beverage choices are great  and the burritos are great and reasonably priced.  Perfect location.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,248,Hands down my favorite quick meal in town. You can tell everything is made fresh  and the meat is high quality. And those tortillas. Seriously.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,249,I was trying to think of a clever opening line for this  similar to  This place is like a Turkish Chipotle.  But all I could come up with was   This place is like a Fishy Freebird   and that s not quite what I was going for. Not everything I do on Yelp is a home run.   But if the game we re playing here is clever tacos  then keep your eye on the Bob. Their tortillas are pretty innovative  their proteins pretty perfect  and their veggies full of vim and vigor. They do lots of creative sauces  and they offer a killer vegan burrito  if that s your style. And they really do have one great soda fountain - no HFCS here. In fact  everything I said about their original store on Ben White holds true at this new location - the only difference I could see is the service line moves from left to right. You ll catch on.  Granted they re brand new  but the staff was super friendly  they kept offering suggestions on how to  pop  flavor into my fish bowl  and I was in-and-out of there for under  10. Incidentally  their  Dr Baja  is our Dr Pepper  and real sugar in soda is a subtle world of difference.  The bottom line is this Cabo Bob s does a whole lot of things right  they re good  they re local  and now they re definitely a lot more accessible. In our very own hometown Field of Tacos - perhaps the most competitive game in town - I think we can point to these guys and call   Score. 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,250,Update  Review on a follow up by owner   The owner Bob messaged me back and offered to try to make things right. I appreciated that offer  and told him as much  but due to just how sick I got on the guacamole  and the fact other family members got sick several weeks later after eating the same thing  again  those that did not eat the guac didn t get sick   I told him I really didn t have the desire to try it again at all. He was pleasant  but that s where it lays.  Thanks Bob  I do hope things work out  but I m still going to have to pass. Cheers.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,251,Most UT-Austin kids would agree that this place trumps Chipotle...always. The main difference  When I think Cabo vs Chipotle  I just think Cabo is more  clean  in every aspect. Hard to describe  but for now  let s talk food.  Walking in you ll notice the decor is bright and colorful. The ordering style is exactly like chipotle but they have 3 different tortilla flavors you can get. I don t ever get the other 2 so I ll only talk about the cilantro tomatillo. Can you taste the cilantro  Probably not  but it s pretty neat to eat a green buritto. You can also get the flavors triple taco-size style.   I believe this place has  more meats than chipotle too..One thing that stands out is the fish. Portioning-wise  IIRC they re pretty generous and give you 2 per taco. I ve only gotten the burritos recently but getting the tacos with fish is always a great go-to for newbies. Anyways  there is no proper combination of ingredients so just throw in whatever looks good. If you get the fish make sure to get the pico on it too.  Lots of sauces to choose from as well. I always get something different so I don t remember anything of them at all. All of them sound and taste good anyway.  Finally  that punch card nets you a free burrito per 6 burritos OR a cabo-bob s t-shirt  which I feel as though is worth it a lot more. Plus  you re going to be coming back here anyway so you don t even have to take into account that you have to buy 6 burritos   P  any menu item  not specifically burritos .  All in all  I ve gone here several times these past few years and there s nothing really holding me back. Price is fair  if not seemingly cheaper than chipotle  but I never compare because the portions are generous to make me think it s cheaper .   9 10  would always come back again and definitely recommend to a friend.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,252,If you like burritos  tortillas  or cane sugar sodas  you will love this place. The frequent diner card is really generous too  buy 6 get 1 free. You will not regret giving this place a try. Mostly I go for the three tacos on three different flavors of tortillas  at no extra charge  with chicken or fried fish.  The burritos are just too massive for me.  This spot hopped on my lunch rotation a while back  and it s there to stay   Seriously the freshly made tortillas are very special and so is the 66 sauce.  If you try the XXtra hot sauce your nose will water in a good way.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,253,Fun atmosphere with great tasting food. I enjoy their tacos  Great place for a quick in and out trip or if you want to stay awhile.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,254,Great food for a great price  I went here due to a friend s raving recommendation and I m happy I finally did so  I tend to avoid this area of town because of having to street park  but this place had a large parking lot  The place is pretty much like Chipotle but with more options  The thing that made this place stand out was the option to choose fish as your protein  They certainly don t hold back on the amount of fish - or any of the toppings  really. They kept piling the toppings higher and higher - all with a smile on their face  Love the variety of toppings and sauces. Food was wonderful  and it was all for an affordable price    The environment itself was great as well. It was clean and spacious. For some reason  there were a lot of law enforcement  city police and state troopers  dining in  so it made me feel pretty safe  I saw lots of people order large bags of take-out  so it s a popular and fast place that can feed all sorts of people. If I was in this area more often  this would definitely be a place that I frequent at. Bonus discovery - it has free wifi there 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,255,We love Cabo bobs    For the most food- get a steak burrito.   For the best bite proportions  get the tacos. I usually do 2 steak and 1 fish  Smoker cheddar tortillas all day...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,256,Giant and delicious burritos. Fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. Solid punch card program  six burritos gets you one free . I come here weekly and have never been disappointed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,257,I m new to the area and a coworker told me to check this place out and it was great   Chipotle and freebird are ok..... but this place was awesome   Next time you want a burrito  go here you won t be disappointed 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,258,Cabo Bob s is by far the best burrito place in Austin. Far superior to Chipotle  Freebird s etc. The staff is always friendly and provides great service. Management at the location near campus is truly awesome. If you ever find yourself near the UT campus  definitely stop here  and make sure to get the queso  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,259,Such a quality burrito joint. I always enjoy a nice custom burrito from here whenever I am hungry. They have never disappointed nor will they ever in my opinion. If you have not tried it  I would definitely recommend   thetruthshallsetyoufree
Cabo Bob's Burritos,260,We ve tried Qdoba and Chiptole  and heard about Cabo Bob s. We were lazy one night and ordered it via delivery service  favor or something - boyfriend got the burrito  I got the salad.  Oh my gosh is this delicious burrito heaven. SO much better than Chiptole  and my favorite new place  sorry Qdoba . The ingredients were delicious  and the aboslutely LOAD your toppings on. Amazing flavor  so filling  and reasonable prices.  The only downside I suppose is that they charge for sour cream...  If you really want to nitpick. But I don t because HECK YES TO THIS BURRITO SPOT 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,261,oh. em. gee. do I love this place  I ve been going to Cabo Bob s near West Campus since they opened a while back and have yet to be disappointed.   1. Their burritos are giant.. every time I eat here and order a burrito  I end up with two meals because I could never finish one in a single sitting.   2. The tortilla flavors  I love the fact that you can choose the flavor of your tortillas. So. Dang. Good.   3. The BEST chips   queso. It probably sounds crazy that the best chips and queso would come from a what appears to be a simple burrito chain  but not I know   but it does  You have to try their chips and queso for yourself.   Love this place and their management.  Top notch local business.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,262,This place is so good  The meats are marinated and cooked perfectly. The chips are thick and one of the best I ve had in Austin. Also ask for the chipotle crema it is the special sauce for anything you get here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,263,Didn t know I needed a better version of Chipotle until I tried this place. Not only are there more options  but they also take that extra step with each ingredient to make it better than the competitors. I was also just sold on them having fried fish as a protein option. Not only was it made to order  but they also LOADED my bowl up with 6 substantial pieces of it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,264,If there is any line expect to wait at least 10 minutes. Quite slow and rather inefficient but for some reason everyone comes here and I will also continue to.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,265,Some of the best burritos in town  You can t go wrong with really anything on the menu. Definitely recommend the cheddar tortillas 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,266,Second time at Cabo Bob s  but it s my first time at this location close to the UT campus. My first visit to Cabo Bob s was about three years ago  and I was looking forward to seeing if there were any changes.   I came around 1 PM  and the line was still fairly long. The plus side was that the line moved extremely fast - good thing  too  cause my friend and I were HUNGRY. We deliberately ate a light breakfast in order to prepare for the mammoth sizes of Cabo Bob s burritos. And mammoth they were  We both ordered the fish burrito - still just as delicious and filling as I remember them to be. However  I noticed that the fish pieces were much smaller than they were before. Nevertheless  the burrito was delicious. Every bite had a different flavor  because all the fillings were mixed well within the burrito.   Will be back to try some of the other items on their menu 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,267,I m not sure if I mean this but I think it s better than Chipotle. I was extremely excited about the tortillas made on the spot. The burrito is HUGE and the price is reasonable. Just a bit far from campus but definitely worth going.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,268,Cabo Bob s is my favorite restaurant around campus. Think of everything you like about Chipotle minus the E. Coli plus better variety  better taste  and better quantity for price. There was one point in time where I came here at least twice a week for a few months.  My personal favorite is a fried fish burrito  loaded up with nearly every option. Another great addition is your ability to choose and mix different tortillas. The line  no matter how long it looks  moves rapidly  and the staff are very friendly. When my friends and I are trying to think of places to eat  Cabo Bob s is always at the top of our list.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,269,Oh...my...sweet...burrito gods. I ve grown up on chipotle thinking it was the king  but this place is the one true king. I felt like a kid at a candy shop with all the fixings I could insert into my pillowy cilantro tomatillo tortilla. The rice was perfect and the brisket was tender and juicy. Get the baja beans  so dang good. I got lost when I got to the sauces veggies extras. I babbled some words and they crafted my masterpiece. Hella good stuff  and I split their  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a  queso with a buddy.   You can t go wrong here... Seriously  you can t. Go try  bet you can t. If you can... Then you don t deserve this place anyway.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,270,WORTH IT. I always feel like I have a food baby afterwards because their burritos are HUGE  but it s all so delicious. I recommend getting the  green tortilla   or Cilantro Tomatillo  if you re getting a burrito. They press the tortillas right in front of you and they have a good selection of meats  sides  etc. to top off your burrito creations.  It can get very busy sometimes  there have been a couple of times where the line went out the door   but the line generally moves pretty fast.  It s one of my favorite places near campus  I d choose this place over places like Chipotle and Qdoba any day.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,271,I love this place  I m usually not the biggest fan of burritos tacos but Cabo Bob s is awesome  It s definitely the freshly pressed tortillas that take it over the top for me. They get nice and semi-crispy  so there s more of a texture to them than Chipotle tortillas. It s also cool that they have different flavors of tortillas. Some people say they can taste the difference  but I gobbled mine up too quickly to tell  oops .  My friends recommended the crispy fish and man  those were so good. I wasn t super hungry that day  so I got tacos instead of a burrito  and I completely devoured them. Each taco had not one  but TWO big pieces of fish  Yay more to love   . The mango salsa was also really good.  I wish I lived in Austin so I could come here more...but alas  it is a treat for the few times I visit. Open one in Houston pretty please  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,272,I heard of Cabo Bob s when others at my church would hire them for catering. I went and am quite a fan  Fresh and piping hot homemade tortillas and so many choices for salads  tacos  burritos you will wish you had more tummy room for all the selections. Be sure and try the mango salsa and the queso here. You can choose from a menu or you can create your own plate. Everything is soooo good. I hear they are working on a north location soon  near  Anderson Lane.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,273,This place is great    Not only is the food great but the servers are completely focused on making your food the best it could possibly be. One of the workers named Rosa can roll the biggest of burritos like its absolutely nothing  5 5 would recommend every time 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,274,I ve been waiting a long long time to try Cabo Bob s in south Austin. For many different reasons  I haven t been able to make the commute to the original location. Well  look at my luck -- They have one right near campus now   Two things I can say about this location  the customer service is really really good and the food will leave you very very satisfied.  Do not mess around  Get the 3 tacos in the build your own section  It s by far the best value. We were greeted by the first employee at the tortilla machine  who was very sweet and walked us through all of the choices.  Best part...  choose a tortilla type  Buttermilk Flour Ancho Chili Cilantro Tomatillo  Awesome  Smokey Cheddar  Amazing   Yes  They have the little dough balls for the tortillas right there. They press them into a tortilla right in front of you and throw them onto a flat grill. Everything about this made me very happy.  I chose the 3 tacos because you can make each taco unique. It s own tortilla style  fillings  toppings. It s like getting to try 3 separate plates. I loved that   You can fill the taco with white or brown rice  3 types of beans  regular guac or some sort of wild guacamole with even more delicious veggies mashed in.  The part that I really enjoyed were the various types of sauces that you could add on. I got a lot of these sauces on the side to try. It actually reminded me a lot of VERTs. I wanted to mix and match the sauces. The employees were well informed. They knew exactly which sauce went with which. The names are really hard to remember  but I think it was the 66 Red sauce that was just to die for with the brisket taco. It almost had a smoky BBQ sauce flavor  but it was a less thick than regular BBQ sauce. My favorite sauce out of all of them was the Chipotle crema. Killer flavor paired with a breaded fish taco.  I love that this is near campus  I almost wish it was closer  so I could walk from my office  The employees were mingling in the eating area since we went during the Christmas holidays  so a lot of them had special recommendations for us to try. This place also has Texas root beer and many other unique sodas to pair with your meal. Plenty of pure cane sugar  HFCS-free options.  Overall  a really yummy first experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,275,This place is really great  with good options if you re on the go and want to eat clean. The ingredients are fresh and you can make a lot of different combinations work based on what you re looking for. I personally love the bowls and salads with grilled veggies and proteins. Also  the fish tacos are some of the best that I ve ever had for a splurge. They are fried  but a great choice on a cheat day.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,276,I go to Cabo Bob s all the time. The food is delicious and fresh. The fresh tortillas are particularly amazing. The entire staff is friendly and helpful. I order to-go all the time and if the order is only a minute or two late  they try and make it up with a free drink or chips. In a city full of good food  Cabo is my favorite.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,277,Any time I crave fish tacos I totally make the drive towards west campus for these. Honestly they are so big and perfect  Everything about these rock and I highly recommend them.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,278,Cabo Bob s gives Torchy s a run for their money. Fresher  and more flavorful than other tex-mex places in town  you know you can count on Bob for a hot and delicious taco or burrito made-to-order as you watch. I m a huge fan of the  Just Fish Tacos   and you can t go wrong with the special queso. Cheap  fast  and fresh. Cabo Bob s definitely feels more personal if you re going for that fast food taco lunch but want something delicious.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,279,This place is the best  Maybe it s the fish tacos  all the toppings  BYOB  build your own bowl   or the colorful flour tortillas made right in front of my eyes. Cabo Bobs is fresh  affordable  and I feel like I m getting my money s worth. My favorites are the fish tacos with the colorful tortillas  loaded with veggies  and salsas. Here at Cabo Bob s everything  is BYOB so whatever you want you can have it. If you haven t been here  you need to get over here. Plus this location is really nice and it s a perfect hang out spot with friends  family or just you.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,280,We had a last minute birthday dinner and Cabo Bob s saved the day with their catering. The food is AMAZING   The tortillas are homemade  all the salsas and condiments are fresh. We are Mexican food snobs because of our heritage  and our travels all over Mexico.  We have now ditched all the other places that were just OK and will only go to Cabo Bob s  LOVE THIS PLACE 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,281,Oh my gosh  this place is fantastic    Everything there is so delicious. So many options and fresh food  Place gets super packed at lunch so expect a wait for to go or ordering. Definitely  worth it every time   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,282,I was sad to realize that this place had taken over for a cool bar that had entertainment the last time I had visited this locale.  I took out the burrito that I had ordered up.  I did get all of the free add ons which really cooled down the burrito once I got it home.  No one wants to eat a cold burrito.  I had to heat it up  guacamole and all in order to feel like it was dinner and not breakfast cereal.    I am sticking to real Mexicans making my Mexican food from now on.  Okay  the guy that heated my tortilla looked Mexican  but I am sure Cabo Bob is the Whitest  White guy in Austin.  I can t buy into this White Guy Burrito revolution perpetrated by these burrito establishments like Chipotle  Qdoba   Freebirds  and  unfortunately  now Cabo Bobs.  I love White People food  just not White People Burritos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,283,I ve heard so many great things about this place for the past couple years and now I ve experienced it myself. This is the place for any burrito lover. I was blown away by the size of their burritos. You really get your money s worth. As far as food taste and quality  Cabo Bob s stands much taller than the competition.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,284,Great spot...everything is delicious. Definitely try the fish tacos   Cool and casual  good service and a lot of different options.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,285,Man.... I thought I would NEVER say this... But Lord forgive me...   CABO BOB S IS BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE.  Seriously.... The portions  ingredients  that  I m in a seaside restaurant  feel  the PUNCH CARDS Hollaaa I m all about the loyalty reward business...  AND FISH   Woooo weeee I can t get enough.  Nowadays there s a lot of burrito restaurants but honestly Cabo Bob s is n mero uno. Thank you Mr. Bob for all that you do for this University  God bless and hook em 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,286,Oh my goodness the fajita beef was amazing    Fresh ingredients  We ll be coming often 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,287,Great tacos. Friendly service. The food was freshly made and the portions are just right.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,288,This is one of my go-to spots for lunch. Massive portions  fair prices  really delicious food. The wait is never too long  though parking is occasionally an issue. It s hard not to default back to something as simply good as this more often than I probably should.   Greatest discovery of 2015  Quite possibly.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,289,My all time favorite - way better than chipotle  I love the homemade tortillas  especially the cheddar ones. They have a variety selection to make your tacos burritos BOMB and the meats are full of flavor. You can never go wrong with adding their spicy sauce as well  I usually make my own tacos with the cheddar tortillas and fill those bad boys  Whatever you order from there  you will not be disappointed.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,290,I have been a frequent eater of the O.G. Cabo Bob s on Ben White and am so happy they finally opened one within walking distance to my apartment.   I ve only been here once since it opened and will definitely be back at least once a week. Having recently gone  gluten-free   I ordered a bowl filled with chicken  brown rice  black beans  pico  regular and mango   lettuce  grilled onions and peppers and the mild sauce. I ate the bowl for dinner that night and the next since they stuffed that container full  which is definitely not a bad thing. When I used to drink sodas like they were water  the Dublin Dr. Depper and the Retro Big Red were my addictions. The frequent eater card and the plastic cups you can keep are added bonuses   Cab Bob s has my heart  which is conveniently located in my stomach  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,291,This was my first time eating at a Cabo Bob s and I have to say it was FABULOUS  Judging by the different choices of soft tortilla shells  the meat selection  and the fresh or saut ed vegetables and sauces available  Cabo Bob s already sets itself far above Chipotle or Baja Fresh  in my opinion. They even have unique soda flavors like Texas peach or old fashioned pink cream soda  If you want a big  flavorful meal that will carry you through both lunch and dinner  give this place a try 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,292,I really enjoyed it  Cool concept with the machine making the tortillas. Though  nothing seems more appealing than seeing it done by hand. That being said I gotta say I really liked it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,293,I ve always been a fan of Cabo Bob s but this is by far the best location of them all. Service and management rock  and my food is superb. Every. Time. Haven t been back to those other burrito places since I first tried Cabo Bob s. Get the queso while you re at it  it won t disappoint 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,294,Their burritos are different-- they can be in one of many different and tasty freshly pressed tortillas  they have the option of FISH      they have a mango sauce  their Ranch 66 sauce is so spicy and matches well with their burritos  and their burritos are HUGE and their portions for fish are very generous.   However  I always feel like I m eating food that has been out there for a while. Nothing tastes fresh-- even when you get fish that is straight from the fryer  something else looks and tastes old like the rice or the beans. Not a big fan of that. Kind of kills the whole experience. I d take a star away for that.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,295,I love this place  Food is always great  and very affordable. The stamp card is awesome and only takes 6 meals to get something for free 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,296,This place has fresh tortillas and so many options to chose from  I love the fish and ancho rancho sauce it s not very spicy but creamy and smoky. Don t forget to get a puch card too  6 purchases gets you a free burrito or shirt.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,297,As other reviews have noted  it operates like a Chipotle. However  I find the selection and quality of ingredients are far superior at Cabo Bob s.   I love the steak  cooked in green eggs    the chips  amp  queso  and the ancho chile tortillas. I recommend the chipotle crema sauce too.  Every time I go in  there are always plenty of people working which I appreciate because the food is fresh  the restaurant is clean  and the employees are happy  amp  friendly.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,298,Sorry I don t get the hype at all - besides the tortilla  if I did a blind taste test I wouldn t know the difference between this and Qdoba  I ordered a pork burrito with an ancho chili tortilla  I do really like how they heat up the tortilla on a round stove  and threw rice  beans  roasted peppers  onions  guac  hot sauce and I felt like I got just a giant  not very tasteful carb-ball  I was hoping for some build in kick from the pork or the green sauce but it didn t come. I didn t add extra hot sauce at the drink station  but I don t think a good burrito or taco requires that you add some super-spicy hot sauce to give it flavor. This had very little flavor of it s own. I will say that for the size of the burrito the prices are pretty good.  7 for a massive  massive burrito.   If I m in the area again  maybe I ll give it one more shot  but this is definitely not a place I would go out of my way for
Cabo Bob's Burritos,299,This review pains me to write. Being a Los Angeles local my whole life - I know burritos. Breakfast burritos  Carne Asada Burritos with Fries  colloquially known as a California burrito  or your standard jam packed Chipotle special...I have had it all. Cabo Bobs has changed the game. And they re very far from my home state of California. The fresh burrito-sized tortilla stopped me in my tracks. The plethora of ingredients was mind blowing. The cherry on top was the fresh fried fish loaded up in front of me. Couple that with the hot sauce and this might be the best burrito I have ever had in my life - a very bittersweet thing to admit.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,300,Momma needed a burrito fix. Yum. We enjoyed the fish burrito with some chips and queso. It hit the spot. Ah  yes  their staff was friendly  too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,301,Food is excellent  I wish they had one in California. It s way better than Chipotle. I had the brisket and queso burrito that was very good. I will definitely be back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,302,I usually end up here once a week and it s amazing. Awesome service and great food. One of my favorite places around campus.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,303,It is like a chipotle to the tenth power. The burritos are massive and super filling. Also  it is super tasty and you can different flavored tortillas  All their sauces are delicious and have a really nice souvenir cup 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,304,Pink watery salsa without even a bit of flavor  Tilapia as the fish  Wet meat  Reminiscent of Chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,305,One of the best fast casual restaurants near UT  Management has always been quick to respond when we have catering requests  and they always do a stellar job.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,306,The verdict is in  Cabo Bob s beats  Chipotle. Having eaten chipotle for a good chunk of my life may have made me jaded to it  but there is so much more variety at Cabo Bob s  You have to try the crispy fish. So good and they pack so much food into their burritos  Their chips and guacamole are great too  the chips are slightly thicker than most normal chips which is something I liked. Prices are good for what you get and I would definitely come back.   Also the staff is so friendly too  Always good to see staff who work so hard and are still able to interact with customers and smile. Makes the whole experience better.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,307,My new favorite burrito place  I love the assortment of different flavored tortillas  probably my favorite aspect. I had a smoky cheddar tortilla but I ve heard great things about all flavors  I want to give ancho chili a try next time. Highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a good burrito. I was recommended this place by my friend Alisha who works there  overall great experience 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,308,This place is so amazing   I want to lather the queso all over my body. It tastes and feels so good. Oo yaaa.. the tortillas are from another planet. They are the secret to this. And the beef and chicken and fish and everything is SO GOOD. Everything is good. Trust me. Just get whatever and you will be like damn that s good. Because it s damn good. My friend Alisha works there and she recommended me this place and I can t thank her enough for showing me this heavenly place. It s truly an experience. Block out your calendar for the day and spend the whole day here. Might as well get married here also. I m proposing to my future wife at Cabo bobs. Thank you mr. Cabo bob      
Cabo Bob's Burritos,309,As a self-proclaimed tortilla snob  you must know that since they make their tortillas fresh to order I am totally obsessed with this place. There are 4 different varieties and I m completely content with the smokey cheddar flavor for the rest of my life. I watched them cook my tortilla from a doughy ball to a crispy  spotty perfect tortilla. If you re okay with weak ass  flaccid tortillas then you may not value Cabo Bob s as I do.   But seriously  I love simple food. If you don t feel there is some value in simple  fresh as fuck food  then you won t dig this place. By simple food  I mean rice  beans  sauteed zucchini  amp  squash  cheese  lettuce  cilantro  guacamole  mango pico and creamy chipolte sauce. All of this in a burrito  as tacos  in a bowl  in a salad  or as nachos. Clearly you must be wondering why I prefer this over say  Freebird s or Chipolte  And your answer is  sauteed zucchini  amp  squash  as well as mango pico. You see  at the other places my filling option to substitute meat are peppers  amp  onions....NO THANKS. And so I ve always been happy without anything extra  living life oblivious. But when you give me a real option other than nasty slimey pepper and onions as my filling  I have a hard time forgiving those other places for their lack of tasty filling substitutes.   In all fairness  I hear the fish  tilapia  tacos are fantastic here. They also have brisket  pork  chicken and beef fajita filling options. What also sets these guys apart are their salsas and sauce options. Delicious  vast options to  make your food spicy or less spicy  creamy chipolte is my go to . If you like sodas without the HFC then you will appreciate their unique soda options. Embrace the portion size and save some for later  this is my advice. I have yet to follow my own advice  but someday...someday.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,310,My favorite place ever  even with a line literally out the door they move quickly while still maintaining a smile and being friendly  luv the food too
Cabo Bob's Burritos,311, DO NOT DARE GO BACK TO CHIPOTLE  This place beats chipotle by a land slide  You get more here for less or the same price and the ingredients are WAAAAY tastier. The burritos are HUGE  the burrito bowls are DELICIOUS and the chips and queso are to DIE for. Please never go to chipotle again  if Cabo Bob s had as many locations as chipotle then chipotle would go out of business.. again.. I took off a star bc of how many times I had to detour myself to another restaurant bc Cabo closes at 10pm   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,312,In the West Campus area but don t want food you can get anywhere else   Head to Cabo Bob s   My coworkers very rarely add places they re willing to go for lunch  but Cabo Bob s made the list  We were SO happy that they added a West Campus location  now we go at least a couple times a month   To be honest  I really only get fish burritos at Cabo Bob s  but that s because they re so dang good. Every single time  the fried fish comes fresh out of the fryer and onto my burrito. Topped with mango pico  cilantro  cabbage  and black beans  the fried fish burrito   4  consistently satiates my appetite. The food combined with a clean seating area with TVs that show either SportsCenter or the Longhorn Network make Cabo Bob s the perfect spot for me to eat lunch and catch up with the sports news during my lunch hour.  ALSO  don t forget to grab a punch card next time you go. For every six entree items you purchase  you get one free entree item OR a Cabo Bob s tshirt. Personally  I just get the free burrito 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,313,Favorite place to eat  period. They have AMAZING meats  soooo many choices of tortilla and toppings to add to the food. The possibilities make it an exciting dining experience every time I go  That and the people are friendly  always ready to help you with your order. Give it a try  you WILL get hooked
Cabo Bob's Burritos,314,Went here for the first time for dinner before 4th of July fireworks  Pork was delicious however I was really stoked for the mango pico and it just didn t do it for me.... it tasted very bland with little to no flavor at all. And it made my burrito terribly soggy by the time I was halfway through because they don t mix the fillers up. They just roll it in layers. That s a good way to ruin a seemingly great burrito. Also  most burrito places don t charge me for queso since I DONT eat beans  but they did  which was also kind of upsetting. I ll probably visit again and make some adjustments in my choices. Overall was an okay experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,315,Today we had Taco Tuesday at our office and brought in lunch for our team from Cabo Bob s. It was fantastic  Everything was fresh and the variety of all of the salsas was exceptional. We ordered the chicken  steak and the brisket. All of it was cooked to perfection and our team could not be happier with the selection. The brisket practically melted in your mouth. If you have a group to feed  this was the way to go  Affordable and delicious. Can t wait for our next Taco Tuesday 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,316,First time eating at Cabo Bobs. I shared a bowl with my boyfriend. We really liked it. We got a brown rice bowl  with mixed beans  chicken and ground beef with bacon  queso  guac  roasted veggies  onions  and some other yummy stuff. I like this place better than chipotle but not better than Austin Burrito company in bee caves which unfortunately closed down recently    at least I found a place that is nearly as good that can replace it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,317,Love Cabo Bob s. Their burritos are huge  Enough for 2 meals. The ingredients are fresh and the food is good. Way better than Chipotle in my opinion.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,318,CABO BOB S over CHIPOTLE all day   PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN HOUSTON  TX   I bookmarked this place prior to going to Austin because I wanted to get some good fish tacos. I came in on a Sunday with my boyfriend before we were heading back home to Houston. They offer many fresh combos including fish tacos  burritos  bowls  and salads. The set up is similar to Chipotle but even fresher and faster. The decor was very inviting and surfer-esque with lots of seating. I visited the Rio Grande location which had it s own private parking lot which was a plus.   I ordered the baja fish tacos which came on corn tortilla and my boyfriend ordered the fish tacos on flour. We both regret not getting a flavored fresh made tortilla so we will be coming back for sure. The fish was fried crisp to perfection and very fresh not greasy. There were plenty of toppings to choose from as well. The soda fountain also had some unique flavors which I loved.   I can t wait to come back to Cabo Bob s Burritos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,319,I was not expecting this place to live up to the hype.  I mean  it s just burritos right   Nope.  This place was great.  The tortillas are hand pressed in front of you and all the toppings are fresh.  I had the  7 and it was delicious...the steak was very tender and well seasoned.  Chips and salsa were freshly made as well  and equally tasty .  Well done Cabo Bob s...I will be back soon.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,320,This place beats chipotle  free birds  and any other burrito place on taste hands down. They offer a huge variety of meats including chicken  steak  crispy fish  etc. I cannot stress how satisfying the burrito wrap is with four distinct and delicious varieties.  Finally  they offer old fashioned cane sugar filled soda s and a killer sweet mint tea. This is the first 5 star fast food-esque I have truly been to in many years.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,321,We recently had Cabo Bob s cater our volunteer recognition party at Healing with Horses Ranch  and it was absolutely delicious. I was mad at myself for never having tried them before  Ingredients seemed very fresh and good quality  queso was amazing  and they were very easy to work with  Definitely recommend  whether it s just for a quick meal or a whole party 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,322,This place is super cool and the fish tacos are to die for    The line gets really long around the lunch hour so plan wisely.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,323,Literally the best deal you can get if you re looking for a lot of great food at an affordable price. Seriously cannot recommend this place enough. Its literally Chipotle with better and more food for the same price.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,324,Fast and friendly  but average fish tacos. However  they are more proud of their burritos which I did not sample and can not review. The atmosphere was nice with a patio  fans and a banana tree  Service was prompted. I could see how college students would enjoy the setting.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,325,I visited Cabo Bob s on several occasions  however not often enough since they are about 20 miles away. I am always amazed at how good their food is. They start off with fresh tortillas and fresh ingredients. This place is what Chipotle wish it could be- good food at a great price.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,326,Check it Bleed s  this place is hip.Lookie here. I can dig grease  n chompin  on some buns and draggin  through the garden. These Big Ass Burrito s are the PHIGGIDY BOMB  YO . They fill yo     up good  you be cryin . Da Smokey Cheddar tortilla  is da SHIZ  NITS  you know what I am sayin  WIGGA  Hey... knock a self a pro  Slick  That gray matter backlot perform us DOWN  I take TCB-in   man  Check it  The Mint Sweet tea........Oh man let me tell. Squeeze off 3 or 4 limes in the large to go drink cup  add 7 packs of pink sugar  pour in the Tea 3 4 way  add ice. By the time you finish that S mofo sucka  you ll be F   ED UP. So all you Crack     Crackers stop by da place to See Arnold and the gang and get yo grub on. Peace 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,327,I tore into these like Liam Neeson tears into people who steal his daughter.  Duuuuuuuude   Insane fresh hot tortillas made right in front of you.  Are you kidding me     These tacos are mouth watering.  I had I literally ordered four just so I could sit there and taste almost everything.  They re way too big for that nonsense  but you know what   I sat there staring at the four tacos and said   This is happening  and ate every one of them.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,328,Walked in 5 minutes before close and they didn t treat me like the asshole I truly am. Wonderful burrito  even better customer service. 10 10 would recommend.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,329,Great place  They have a wide variety of options - so they probably have something for you too. The employees are always pleasant  even when they have lines that go all the way outside  and are really helpful if you re not sure on what to get. All their options are great but I particularly enjoy their fish the most 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,330,Cabo Bob s definitely ranks in the upper echelon of burrito-destinations in Austin.  Unfortunately  this isn t saying much because Austin is somewhat of a burrito desert. Quality tacos  chalupas  enchiladas  rellenos and whatever-else abound in Austin  but for whatever reason  no establishment here has been able to replicate the quality burritos commonly found on the west coast.   Cabo Bob s may offer bit more novelty than Chipotle  but my body feels the exact same afterwards.   The brown rice at Cabo Bobs is undercooked  stiff  and most certainly won t be broken down by my body. Here s a pointer  Bob  cook your brown rice with a bit more water  and perhaps a bit longer.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,331,Had heard a lot of great things around town about Cabo Bob s so we decided to stop in while we were at Breed  amp  Co. The staff was pleasant while we ordered a variety of different signature tacos.   I am from San Antonio and tacos are kind of our thing. These tacos were tasty but smothered in sauces and too much cabbage. Let the protein be the star  We must have come right after the rush because we could still see remnants on most of the tables. We will have to be back to try some different tacos because we owe Cabo Bob that much 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,332,Big Bland Burrito  Not sure what the hype is all about. The brisket needs flavor and the there is not much to the big burrito.   Also  wish the took care of new folks better instead of pushing them through the line. When I asked about the sauces they simply pointed me to the window that had their names on them.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,333,This place is amazing  They make the tortillas in front of you at this rotating press machine  as soon as you tell them. You point and tell them what toppings you want  and the possibilities are endless  Fresh fish tacos  great steak  tasty chicken or vegetarian.  I ordered the brisket and asked to have everything  but the kitchen sink  Great for picky eaters. Their soda cups are so cool and durable  I take it home with me...
Cabo Bob's Burritos,334,Man o man I love me some Cabo Bobs  Unfortunately this isn t yet a national chain but it should be. It s my burrito go to in Austin  they make their own tortillas while you wait  try the fish tacos  also their steak is so good  this place is so much better than Chipotle or Qdoba. Mmmmm I get hungry just thinking about it. Give it a try 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,335,This place is better than chipotle  in my opinion   amp  amp  that s a big statement because chipotle is amazing. This is like the same food creation process but more choices...delicious choices.  One thing that you have to get is the fish tacos or just anything with the fish    Another thing is they have different types of flour  more variety of toppings  and more sauces. The fried fish is seasoned incredibly and I love it. There s even stuff like mango salsa   I just wish this place had more locations and closer to the UT campus  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,336,From freshly made tortillas to fish just out of the fryer  every ingredient from start to finish in my Baja fish tacos was very fresh  Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful as well and parking is definitely not an issue. For about  8 for 3 amazingly delicious fish tacos  I d say Cabo Bob s is beyond compare.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,337,They have really great service and you cant beat the location  Friendly staff and really fresh ingredients.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,338,I finally caved and came here after all of my friends pestered me about it. Needless to say  I don t think I ll ever go to Chipotle again. Now don t get me wrong- Chipotle is phenomenal but the fish tacos at Cabo Bob s are to die for. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside  their crispy fish perfectly complements the sweet and spicy tang from the rest of the taco. Also  the service was great  Everyone was so friendly and the atmosphere was great  So glad I came here 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,339,I can t rave enough about this place.  We frequently order this for our office  and the tortillas are always soft and fresh and the chicken is so yum  And you have to try the spicy ranch sauce  orange in color -- I literally cover everything in the sauce.  To me  it is like an upgraded Chipotle with fresher ingredients and tasty sides.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,340,A definite step up from freebird chipotle. It has the same fast-casual business model but the ingredients are much  much fresher and much more inspired.  If you re tired of hearing  wheat or white tortilla  at your burrito bar  then you re going to love this place. To start you off   they change things up by offering you buttermilk-flour or cilantro-spice tortillas  or another less-interesting option I forgot . They then build the burrito in front of you with the typical ingredients  each one of them jazzed up in some way.  And jazzed up they were. You can actually taste the difference. The beef fajita meat option is particularly flavorful--I definitely recommend. They go a little heavy on the beans and rice  but ultimately it turns out to be a pretty good burrito. The vegetables are particularly noteworthy for their freshness. I thought I was eating a salad.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,341,Need to be full for 5 hours  Cabo Bob s is perfect. I usually get the beef or fish  but you can t go wrong 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,342,I m a fish taco snob. This place has the best I ve ever had   And it s fun to watch them make the tortillas. It s also my 14year old s most requested restaurant  And weLOVE their hot sauce too  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,343,YUM. This might be the best kept secret in town. And it s hiding in plain sight  The food is amazing and the queso  ROCK    Great environment. Great prices for the amount of food  YUM.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,344,Fish. Burrito. Get this.   So thankful they made a central location. Been twice so far  and the service and food have both been fantastic. Plenty of seating and TVs for watching sports  There s a lot of outdoor seating as well.   Really  little must be said about Cabo Bob s because their burritos are the disco pants of all burrito chains in Austin. Come here. They have a frequent eater card too  Six meals gets you a free burrito or a CB s tshirt.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,345,Clean  right-priced and  best of all  good food. I tried the fish tacos with no complaint. Next time will ask if they have a not fried option. My friend had a HUGE burrito--took half home to his wife. He s a fan of chipotle  and says this was fresher and better variety.   The manager  Arnold  I think  stopped by our table. He was genuinely friendly and has the attitude to make this place succeed  imo. Friendly staff too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,346,One of the best places to eat in Austin  period. I used to frequent Freebird s all the time  but Cabo Bob s has completely stolen that position and will probably keep it forever.  I mean really  tortillas that are freshly cooked right in front of you  high quality meat  home made chips  really good queso  and real sugar soda fountains  It s absurdly good.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,347,Why anyone still goes to Chipotle I don t know  This place is SO much better and faster   Their tortillas are amazing and freshly pressed when you re going down the line  so no more cardboard tortillas  They also have great flavors like cilantro tomatillo that really do make your food better.  Their ingredients are a lot fresher than Chipotle s  their fajita steak is always cooked perfectly and it never dry  They have great sauces that you can add to your burrito for free and their guac is a lot better too    The employees are also super nice and friendly. They give great portions and are really helpful when you re deciding.   I ll never be going back to Chipotle  I m in and out of this place within 10 minutes 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,348,This is my favourite burrito place for sure   You get to pick the flavour of the tortilla  which is amazing   Plus they give you soooo much food  Highly recommend the cilantro tomatillo tortillas 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,349,Probably the only legit mission style burrito I ve had in Austin people are cool  let me walk in with my pup to order  very friendly  and the tortillas are off the hook
Cabo Bob's Burritos,350,So delicious  If you want a mouth watering burrito then please go to cabo bobs  Their chips and salsa is a must try and their service is fast and efficient  And the fish tacos are a delicious healthy alternative  Highly recommend  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,351,Every time my friends are in town they come straight here and get it for breakfast  lunch  and dinner. Insanely fresh  warm  good food  You will never be satisfied from chipotle once you ve got a whif of the yumminess that is Cabo 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,352,Tortillas made fresh in front of you  nice vibe  great crowd  very welcoming  and food is great. I d recommend the deluxe fish tacos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,353,When I first tried this I was shocked that it wasn t as popular as Chipotle. There s plenty of seating inside  and the atmosphere is very peaceful. They have fish as one of the options  and that s something you rarely find in Mexican restaurants. Everything just tastes fresh  and that s what I love about this place 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,354,The main attraction of Cabo Bob s is definitely the fresh tortillas. You ve got 4 choices - flour  chili  cheese  and cilantro. The flour is a classic - boring  I know  but it s there for a reason. The chili is okay  it s not spicy or anything. You can get pretty much whatever you want in your burrito bowl taco. They have fish here  which is something you don t find at most places. Beware of getting it in a burrito - it will probably lose its crispiness due to all of the other ingredients. With a bowl or taco  it fares much better  since the pieces are usually put at the top. Other ingredients are pretty much standard.  I ve been here twice now  and I ve had pretty different experiences. The first time was great - no problems ordering  and the food was tasty. The second time  and probably my last time  it was quite a pain. Due to a language barrier  the person making my burrito put the things I _didn t_ want on my burrito. It got fixed  but it was quite a wait to get it remade since they were low on fish and had to fry up some more. Ugh  these things shouldn t happen. The burrito wasn t even good. I like Chipotle more - they are at least consistent.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,355,Best chips and queso...Best. Their tacos and burrito s are really delicious too  Way better than free birds and waaay better than chipotle.  Try Cabo Bob s and I doubt you will ever visit the other two again   Oh yeah  a major big deal...there is always soccer on one of their TVs...instant arrow to my heart.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,356,The food here is absolutely amazing. It s so delicious. There s parking available  which is a godsend here in West Campus   and there s plenty of seating for small and large groups. There are lots of options here  so everyone will have something they ll be able to order and enjoy. I personally get the fish burrito in a cheddar tortilla every single time I come  and it s the best burrito I ve ever had. Everything tastes super fresh  and the pico de gallo with mango is fantastic.   It s well priced too  and for  7 you get a massive burrito that tastes great and is absolutely worth the trek down to the north side of Guad. You won t regret it 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,357,Stopped in on Moving Saturday in West Campus.  We must have gotten lucky because we found parking near the door and a very short line.  The staff was friendly and the food was great.   The atmosphere was good.  I would certainly return in the future
Cabo Bob's Burritos,358,Grubbed on fish tacos  2 and it definitely hit the spot. Thanks cabo bob s  Your tacos rock and so fresh   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,359,This is the best burrito place that I have experienced in Austin  The amount of options at this place is awesome. The fresh tortillas with different flavors is the selling point at least in my book.  Fast. Friendly. Delicious. Decently priced.  I am a regular for sure here. Love it sooo much  Turned my whole family onto this place and we all couldn t rave about it more
Cabo Bob's Burritos,360,Cabo Bob s catered our company lunch on May 3rd and it was out of this world delicious   I will definitely plan to stop by and dine in person.  I loved the flavors and the presentation.  We all are voting to have y all back soon 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,361,It s good. Maybe more like 3.5 stars. Got the  2 to  go. Tortillas are nice. Tastes fine overall - nothing spectacular. Worked in a quick pinch lunch. Expected more flavor out of the sauces.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,362,I got a burrito  and it was quite bland. The rice was hard and flavorless. The meat and limited add-ins were not very flavorful. I will say that the tortillas were fresh and tasty  but overall you can get much better burritos from places such as chipotle or freebirds for the same price.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,363,Awesome place for some delicious quick food. Lots of options for the whole family. The fresh made tortillas add that extra something and the fajita meat is great. I love all the topping options and the cane sugar soda or mint tea to drink.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,364,I ve given Chipotle 5 stars and I think Cabo Bob s is even better. The tortillas are made fresh to order. I ve tried all 4 flavors but ancho chili is my favorite. The meat is good quality. There s a ton of sauce choices. Food is reasonably priced    7  and they have stamp cards for returning customers.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,365,I got a free burrito because of my last review  That s so nice of Cabo Bob s  thank you   I come here AT LEAST once a week. The punch card system has treated me so well. Since my last review  I indeed have had the fish tacos and I cannot return to anything else. There is nothing better than getting fish fresh from the frier on your tacos.  Mas pescado  por favor   is the best thing to hear when you are near the end of the line.  Furthermore  the staff at this location is just great  They all seem so focused  at ease  and even friendly despite the massive waves of customers they get.   Cabo Bob s is just the best food place to happen to West Campus because of their good prices  true high-quality ingredients  and it being a truly respectable business.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,366,I need you Cabo Bobs on Sunday s.... You are the only cure to the worst of hangovers and the burrito urges. Pleaseeeeeeee
Cabo Bob's Burritos,367,Wonderrrrfuuullll    I finally went after my coworker kept bragging on them  it was everything he said  Fresh tortillas  wide variety of toppings  CLEAN   I love it      But don t take my word  Go check it out yourself. The Manager was very friendly and funny and also offered us punch cards that you only have to use like 6 times in order to get something free    winning
Cabo Bob's Burritos,368,I like this place. they have great burritos  great tortillas they make in front of you. give it a try if your wanting Mexican fast food with a good quality.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,369,This place is awesome  Not exactly a hole-in-the-wall joint but it beats alot of those Mexican chain restaurants. You order like a Chipotle style service where you go down the line and choose your ingredients. However  I can immediately tell that the sauce and ingredients are fresh and the portions are about the same as Chipotle.  If you like that kind of Mexican food this place is awesome. They also have bottled soda which tastes way better than those fountain drinks. I ordered  6 which is a Brisket with Cheese Burrito with rice  beans  sour cream  lettuce  salsa  etc.  you can choose your own ingredients . They also have a punch card with every 7th meal free or you get a T-shirt.  Thank god for this place  it s my new favorite Mexican hot spot 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,370,The food here is amazing. I am not a huge fan of Chipotle or Qdoba.  They offer a good variety of options for a pretty good price.  I really like the fact that we can choose our own flavor of tortilla and even combine some flavors.  The veggies are standard but they offer brisket and fried fish for the meat filling  which are amazing. I would recommend 10 10.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,371,Reviewed by my 7 year old daughter  this was the best restaurant I have ever been to. We love the tacos so much. My sister likes the big round table. My dad ate a huge burrito in about two minutes. The people were really nice. I would like to go there every day if I could 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,372,Out of all the nearby places in west campus  Cabo Bob s is the best  The staff is really friendly and polite. Every time I go  the ingredients are always fresh and the tortillas are perfect. The variety is astounding. The fish burrito is my new favorite burrito. Just when you think they can t get any better  they also have a rewards card so that every 7th burrito or tacos combo you purchase is free  I recommend Cabo s for everyone 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,373,Honestly  cabo bobs was actually pretty good. The burrito is pretty much the biggest meal I ve ever Been served in my life and the brisket was pretty tasty. Better than freebirds  absolutely  better than chipotle  Absolutely. Chipotle is not hard to beat  it s always uneventful. Better salsas and more flavor here.   ridiculously cheap    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,374,As a self proclaimed connoisseur of burritos  I bestow the award of best burrito in Austin to my friends at Cabo Bob s.  Wonderful establsihment.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,375,These burritos were HUGE and so so yummy. Way more flavor and way more food than chipotle for the same price  I am vegan and got the veggie burrito and it was a 10 10 and lasted me like 3 meals. Definitely worth a visit
Cabo Bob's Burritos,376,I am in town for the day visiting my friend who goes to UT and I was hungry after driving all the way from Dallas. Looked up this place and decided to order online. My order was ready right when it said it was gonna be ready and the customer service was great. The food would be overpriced if it was Chipotle  but this ain t not Chipotle. I m gonna have some dreams about this burrito tonight. 10 10
Cabo Bob's Burritos,377,This is my new go-to place  My last 3x at chipotle have been sucky so I started coming here and they never fail to impress me with the quality of food and quick service  The fresh tortillas are amazing  I always get a steak burrito  The brisket is also awesome  Everything is great here. You can t go wrong with any choice 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,378,Cabo Bob s is all about the freshly-made tortillas and expanse of flavors that puts Chipotle to shame. It costs roughly the same for a Chipotle-style mega burrito but it definitely tastes much better because of the fresher ingredients. If you want to get a bowl however  Chipotle definitely has larger portion sizes for those.  I usually get the  5 Pork Burrito since I don t really need to have queso for every meal  it is delicious however . Their brisket is surprisingly good  especially considering how snobby Texas makes one when it comes to BBQ. I also really enjoy the Ancho Chili Tortilla that is freshly pressed and cooked as you order.   The fountain drinks are all pure cane sugar sodas including the fantastic Maine Root Doppelg nger  so be warned you namebrand drinkers    They also have a loyalty program that gives you a free burrito  or t-shirt   for every six that you buy. That works out to each burrito costing  1 less in the long run  if you re counting .  If you want something like Chipotle and don t want to walk to Chipotle  then this is a great alternative.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,379,I love this place. Awesome burritos  tacos  etc. And the tortillas are made to order  There are 4 different flavors you can choose from  smoky cheddar  buttermilk  ancho chili and cilantro tomatillo. I went with the cilantro tomatillo with white rice  chicken and queso cheese for an extra 99 cents   so worth it . Then I loaded it up with veggies  sour cream  salsa and chipotle crema sauce. Sodas are also really unique  and they re made with pure sugar cane  The only reason why I left 4 stars is b c they skimped a bit on my chicken. Aside from that  I can t really complain. One of the best burritos I ve had in a long time  and I m glad they re closer to campus. The other location was a trek  especially during rush hour traffic.  Great place to hang out with friends  and they have tons of outdoor seating 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,380,Had my first Cabo Bobs experience today. Fresh  tasty  and quick food that I ll definitely be back for. There was definitely a lunch rush and what really made today s experience great was the over the top customer service from Arnold  who truly knows how to run a restaurant  Thank you Arnold and your team for a fantastic meal 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,381,Always fresh  amp  delicious. The staff is always very friendly and quick in the line  while still being very attentive to your needs  . I d say it is better than chipotle and definitely better than freebirds.   Of course I feel like every burrito place could have a few more topping options but they still have enough to make a delicious chicken bowl 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,382,Delicious fresh food and awesome service. The environment is laid back island music   Lots of service men and women in there great place to find your dream spouse and enjoy a delicious meal
Cabo Bob's Burritos,383,If I could give Cabo Bob s 10 stars  I would. Cabo Bob s is the best burrito place near UT. So many ingredient choices  and no matter what you choose  you can t go wrong. If you haven t had Cabo Bob s  you haven t lived.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,384,Just as good as the other location. So  excellent. I recommend the fish with mango pico  cabbage  lime juice  and whatever else you want. Cabo Bob s is beyond any other burrito place in town.   At this location  the parking lot can get congested at peak times.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,385,I don t know how I lived in west campus for 4 years without ever trying Cabo Bob s  but I am eternally grateful for finally being introduced  The meat is so flavorful  the service is fast  the price is certainly worth it  and the tortillas are delicious. I always get the bowl with pork and 2 small cilantro tortillas on the side because they re just amazing.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,386,Great spot for your burrito fix  I d consider this a notch above Freebird s  although I still love Freebird s. There are different choices here than Freebird s though  various grilled veggies  fish   and they press and cook the tortillas to order. The fajita meats are nice and smoky  especially the beef. The chicken was a tad dry. I ordered the fish burrito for myself  topped with shredded cabbage and mango salsa. I can t tell you how much I loooove mango salsa  so this did not disappoint. The burritos are about  8 and the size of a small child  so I d say you get a great deal for the amount of food you receive. The fish is fried and not fishy at all  but decently seasoned. I am happy I tried C.B.s and look forward to having it again.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,387,I like that I can create my own burrito online and go pick it up  I haven t tried too many things from here other than the fish. My friend says the chicken is moist and flavorful. They have a large selection of salsa s and hot sauces. The prices are reasonable  I will continue to use this as a work lunch option.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,388,As if this place needs any more good reviews  but here I go.   I ve been getting my burrito fix here since the first location opened down south. Chipotle and Qdoba are no longer part of my vocabulary. My go-to order  Number 10 veggie burrito all the way. Even my carnivore friends agree it s the bomb. If I wasn t a starving college student I would be here everyday drinking Dublin Dr. Pepper and eating fresh pressed tortillas.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,389,This place is really good    It is similar to Chipotle where you can get tacos  burritos  salads  bowls  and mix and match with beans  pico  salsa  rice  lettuce  cheese  guacamole  etc.   You pick a type of tortilla which is cooked from dough form to fresh tortillas right in front of your eyes  Pick any toppings and top it off with a variety of sauces. It is delicious and fresh  I got the crispy fish and beef fajita. They have pure cane sugar soda with interesting flavors like squeeze orange soda or doppelg nger soda and not your traditional coke or pepsi products.  Tip  Using the UMeTime Application you can get 2 tacos  chips and queso  and a drink for only  5.99    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,390,Cabo bobs is the definition of chipotle on steroids. Only if you re a burrito or taco eater though. The bowls are average and I feel like chipotle would give you way more.   The burritos and tacos though... There s just something about freshly made tortillas. And with that alone it beats chipotle by strides. Try the fried fish tacos  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,391,Soooo good. I come for lunch  and either people don t realize that it is here yet  or I miss the lunch rush  since I have never had to stand in a long line like the one on Ben White.  I get the salad and tacos with chicken and the fixings. I have an internal battle every time deciding on whether or not to be good and get the salad  or make my mouth really happy and get the tacos  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,392,Fresh pressed and grilled tortillas  a rather large selection of everything  nice fresh veggies  totally unique soda fountain. If you want a lot of choices when you re getting a burrito  this is the place for you. No matter what you order  you will be served a mountain of food.  Decor is a little bland  with a corrugated-steel and vague surf theme.  Music is not great.  Recommended. I predict this will be a longer-lasting restaurant in this space than most of the others in recent memory  if they keep up the quality of the food.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,393,The tortillas are prepared fresh in front of you. They fill them as you want them.  The result is nothing but wonderful.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,394,Dear God  honey mint tea  the yummiest bowls and mango salsa  and Gluten Free.  Only thing better that could happen at this place if they had a live simulator to ride a wave on their groovy beach themed decor.  Fan-freaking-tastic.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,395,There s two one-way roads between California and Austin. The breakfast taco and the cali-style burrito. Honestly  I don t care if Californicators get breakfast burritos. What I do miss about living  briefly  in California are the vegetable burritos. Hey  Freebirds is great  but there aren t any VEGETABLES in their veggie burritos. Enter Cabo Bob s. Love  love  love the veggie burrito. Really  all it needs is more veggies. Carrots  broccoli  mushrooms  and other stuff.  The staff are super nice  they have Maine Root soda-pops  this one is conveniently located near head shops and boutique hardware stores.  Tip  one burrito will feed two people.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,396,The staff here is so friendly and helpful  they really know their stuff   Menu is overwhelming with choices  and since I am not used to building my own burrito I really needed help. Their number items are all good  my mom especially liked the fish burrito. The mint iced tea is sweetened  we loved it. They also have unsweetened which none of us cared to try. All the burritos are loaded  one of my friends had their veggie and really enjoyed it.  They also have a stamp card  buy 6 and get a free burrito or shirt. We love their food and would rather just pay them for it and take a corny shirt back to Massachusetts as a souvenir.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,397,Enjoyed the fish burrito. Same concept as chipotle but more variety of meat and tortillas. Fast and inexpensive meal if you re looking for a quick bite.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,398,I have been to Cabo Bob s a million times and not sure why I have not written a review. For those that don t know me I have been in the restaurant business for 20 years. I am very picky on not just food but over all experience and service. This place is clean top to bottom. Fresh scratch food. Service wonderful. I like walking in and them remembering what I like. All the details are met here. Do yourself a favor and go in and enjoy a perfect dining experience.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,399,Awesome food with a great value  Probably went 4-5 times the month I found out about it.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,400,The  Best Beef Burrito  was not that at all... Other than the fact that the tortilla is huge so it makes for a massive burrito  I don t get the hype. They were skimpy on the beef but put tons of rice  and it was very bland. The staff was so quick  some of them forgot their customer service skills and manners. I also feel like it was overpriced  I paid almost  12 for one tasteless burrito and a Mexican coke.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,401,Super amazing    It has a wide selections of different ingridients compared to Chipotle but it definetely doesnt dissapoint at all  I highly recommend it over any other place like it  They are super freindly and the different flavor tortillas for their burritos are awesome  All their grilled veggies are awesome too  high quality meat as well 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,402,I like this place sooo much   Flavor is on point  Vegan friendly   I love ordering take out   One complaint -- seems like there is too much oil used to cook the simplest things  rice  amp  beans.  Flavor is so good  the extra lip balm won t stop me from going.   truthtelling lol
Cabo Bob's Burritos,403,This is my favorite place to get some good food. The staff are friendly  the food is always on point  and fairly priced. Sometimes there s a long queue for food  and I believe that it s because they re so good. Will definitely continue to go here 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,404,Great place for fish tacos and fish burritos. They use freshly made tortillas  3 different kinds to choose from . The mango salsa is also a must try here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,405,The burritos served at Cabo Bob s are probably the biggest burritos I have ever seen  I like that they have ancho chili tortillas. Very different than any other place around. I have only ordered Cabo Bob s on favor once  so I didn t get to see the inside however  I drive past it every day and it looks like a great little restaurant to hang in. I also ordered their queso and it was just okay. Not the best I have ever had  but not too bad either. I ordered the brisket burritto and it was pretty tasty. I wish people who made burritos would mix it up better though. I don t want a mouthful of sauce and lettuce with no brisket  but beggars can t be choosers. Not sure what all the hype is about surrounding this place. It was good  but not fabulous. Maybe it was an off day. Their prices are very fair though. I will be back to try something different.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,406,Best food ever they make tortillas fresh as ordered and the ingredients look fresh as could be not to mention the authentic house made hot sauce to top the wonderfully prepared melody of taste about to be consumed  well I made myself hungry can t wait till they open tomorrow
Cabo Bob's Burritos,407,Best quick service Tacos and Burritos in Austin. Do yourself a favor  buy a bag of their chips. Take the bag home and leave it sit over night  then enjoy. Seriously the chips are the best but even better after a day in a bag  You re welcome 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,408,Some of the best burritos tacos I ve ever had  and definitely the best fast food fast casual restaurant I ve ever been to. The fillings are good quality ingredients  the fish is amazing  plus there s a great selection of sauces and tortillas. One of the first places I will recommend to someone in Austin.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,409,This place s food is incredibly delicious  I also really like that their sodas are so unique and made with real cane sugar.   Their fish tacos are my fave and their queso is amazing 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,410,The best burrito I ve ever had. It was massive and made more than a couple meals for me. Absolutely delicious food and fresh ingredients and more than worth it for the price. This will be my go-to burrito place in Austin from now on. And the customer service was stellar. Love Cabo Bob s  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,411,We got a group order here at work.  I got a bowl with fish and all the veggie options I could grab.  Topped with Chipotle sauce.  It was truly excellent and HUGE    Last time I had Cabo Bob s it was their Ben White store some years ago  sometimes it was great  other not so great   so I am glad they were doing well enough to open another location to continue with their unique offerings.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,412,Cabo Bob s is my new favorite place to get a burrito. The ingredients are fresh and they even make the tortillas right in front of you. They also have four different kinds of tortillas that can be mixed together. In addition  you can t go wrong with a side of quest or getting their tacos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,413,I really liked this place  The burritos are big and cheesy  and I like that you aren t required to pick from a menu of burritos full of veggies and things I don t want. My only complaint is that the rice is full of some lettuce thing that prefer not to have. Overall  I love these burritos 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,414,I ordered online to be picked up. As I pull up around 11 40ish am... I see the parking lot packed already. I see a couple guys headed out so I pull in a lil closer to their vehicle. As I am parking  I see a huge white Suburban like vehicle  on my rear view mirror. Both the driver and passenger are sticking their fingers at me. I am like  I saw them parked just sitting there no signal light no nothing.  probably on their phones  So  I get in to get my order then I see a long line. I  go to the cashier station and they told me I didn t have to wait. I didn t notice no signs about To Go orders but it will be helpful. I wished they would have a To Go Parking as well. My friend wished there was another way to keep her corn tortilla on her fish tacos from falling apart  Got wet.  And for those A  Wipes that stuck their fingers out.. Jokes on them bc I was in  amp  out in like 3 min. meanwhile they were stuck behind that long line all cowardly hiding.... HAAA  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,415,Why go to Chipotle or Qdoba when Cabo Bob s exists  Their tortilla choices are incredible and all fillings meat are always fresh. Great queso too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,416,I had the  7 steak burrito and loved it even though I don t normally do burrito places. I keep looking at their menu and trying to decide what to eat next. Restaurant was nice and clean  had a good vibe to it  food was great. Definitely stopping by again soon.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,417,Story time... A friend and I decided to go to one of our fav burrito spots on a beautiful Saturday. As I was perfecting my order  I was interrupted by a workers negative attitude. She then proceeded to toss my friends salsa towards him opposed to gently handing it over. I assume she did this because my pal upset her by ordering such a massive burrito. Nonetheless  I enjoyed my time at Cabo bobs today eating and watching playoff basketball. Will return
Cabo Bob's Burritos,418,Tried all of their tortillas and was amazed on the great flavor they added to the over all experience. Very friendly staff that helps out with decisions if you are debating on what to get. Been now twice since coming to Austin and recommend everyone trying them out new to the area.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,419,It s a great burrito place  I had the burrito bowl  but I thought it was just as good as any other place for a burrito bowl  I really appreciate how they make their own tortillas  so delicious  To sum it up  there wasn t anything special about the bowl.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,420,I love Cabo Bobs.. where to start  The homemade tortillas are made before your very eyes soon to be followed by an exemplary array of offerings including fish. I always come here when I need a serious munchie fix and they have never failed me. The staff are some of the most pleasant people which makes the experience even more enjoyable. If you haven t eaten here or at their south location  yet  you need to  5 stars.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,421,This is probably one of my favorite places to go. I go to Cabo Bob s at least once a week  and sometimes multiple times a week. My favorite thing by far is to get fish tacos with cilantro tomatillo tortillas  and then just add my own personal combination of toppings on. Their ingredients are fresh and delicious  and their drinks are great. I love a mixture of the sweet mint tea with their lemonade. I would definitely recommend coming here and trying to everyone 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,422,The owner had messaged me and apologized for the experience I had and made it right for me. I was back in Austin and decided to check out Cabo Bob s again. The burrito was absolutely perfect. A  for customer service and A    for food quality. THANK YOU  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,423,Great tortillas and toppings  So much better than moes and chipotle. Just be prepared that the line goes fast so you need to know what you want 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,424,More of a 3.5 than a 4. Though I really really enjoyed the burrito I had it was pretty much falling apart because there was too much stuffing inside of it. It was the  4 Fish Burrito that I ordered. Despite my disappointment of it falling apart I recognize greatness whenever I see it. The burrito tasted flavorful and fresh. Will be returning  though I m hoping the burrito won t fall apart next time. Edit  I returned here the burrito I had didn t fall apart and it tasted even better than the first time. I absolutely loved it  So now this is more of a 4 star. Edit  Now I just love this place so 5 stars. My go to place for burritos. So glad I gave this place another chance since the first time I went here was literally my worst experience I had with them.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,425,Pretty good for my first time visit.  I had a fajita steak burrito and it was much better than Chipotle.  The limited parking kinda sucks though.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,426,I was pretty excited to try this place and had a good reason to as I had a buy one get one free coupon.  Yes  it s great that they make their tortillas to order. They have quite a bit of choices too for fillings  sauces and condiments.  I think I had either brisket or pork and I got queso and something else in it.  Honestly  it was pretty underwhelming.  I m not sure if I just muddled the flavor too much or not but I was hoping the counter person would ve steered me in the right direction but sadly  I just had paid nearly  20 for a bogo free burrito and a soda or something stupid like that.  Needless to say  I m in no rush to go back.  I should also point out that I m not a nut about burritos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,427,I have only been here twice  considering the fact that  sadly  I do not live in Austin  but both times have been super satisfying. I appreciate Cabo Bob s efforts towards serving fresh food  because when you get your bowl and or burrito  all that freshness combined is pleasing. The place itself is clean and the employees are nice  An upgrade from Chipotle  perhaps.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,428,I will definitely be giving them another shot after hearing from one of the managers  Great customer service   Changed my 1 star to 4  will change to 5 after I try it again   amp  hopefully love it     Previous post  Pork tacos are terrible   Covered  amp  dripping in orange  amp  yellow grease. Tortilla is soaked in grease too  it is orange  amp  yellow as well.  There is about 2 ounces of grease  in the foil left over. Did they spoon in extra grease 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,429,This place rocks. I love the real cane sugar sodas from the fountain. The humongous burrito tasted great. I will return. At lunch they had a line but it moved quickly.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,430,Cabo Bob s recently catered an event for us at UT Austin and did an excellent job.  The taco bar  pork  chicken  and vegetarian   was a hit with all the attendees and the staff was great to work with for the event.  Thank you for the first class service and delicious food.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,431,This place is very fresh and unique  They offer a wide variety of burritos  tortillas  and ingredients that Chipotle can t touch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a filling meal 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,432,Love that they opened this location  much closer to where I live. Consistently great food  fish tacos on buttermilk tortillas are my jam  and friendly service. I also see the owners in this location a lot  behind the counter or talking to customers. It s great that they get so involved in the daily operations. One of my favorite places in Austin 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,433,Better than chipotle. Enough said. Good flavorful meat and the cheese tops it off perfectly  I would pick this over Qdoba and chipotle. It s also a pretty nice place to sit in and eat with friends.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,434,Excellent fish burrito. Great price. Nuff said  Good atmosphere. Would be nice if they had beer. But nobody s perfect  - 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,435,I recommend fish tacos on fresh tortillas topped with cilantro  jalape os  guacamole  and mango pico.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,436,Go to the Ben White location  this one has flies flying EVERYWHERE. I won t be back to this specific location  it kinda ruined my perception on Cabo Bob s but I m sure I ll forget and go back to the other location.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,437,Cabo Bob s has to be the best burrito place in town. From the fresh tortillas to all the great fillings  this place rocks.  To start  there are multiple flavors of tortillas to choose from that get pressed and cooked as you order   As for the fillings  they have the standard fare for burrito places but they also have fish available  something you won t get at similar spots.  I love Cabo Bob s and would recommend it to anyone.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,438,SO GOOD. Super fresh and always friendly staff. Sometimes there will be a long line  because it s good food AND close to campus   however  they re very good at keeping the line going.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,439,This place is freakin awesome  I used to drive from Round Rock all the way to the Ben White location just for the fish tacos if that gives you any idea of how delicious they are. Now just I trek the location on Rio Grande    The tortillas  fish  salsas  etc. are fresh  the folks behind the line are nice  and I honestly can t think of a bad experience in the many times I ve been to either location. They also have pure cane sugar sodas which just adds to the cravings for this place.  My only suggestion to the business is to open a location up north  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,440,Came here on a nurse s recommendation at the hospital that I was just in for four days. Oh my....what wonderful fish tacos. I tried each kind of the tortillas and all are highly recommended. I wish they had a grilled fish option but the breading is light so no real complaint. Yummy 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,441,Solid eats...I enjoy the fish tacos and fish burrito  when I m real hungry .  Fresh  flavorful ingredients in tacos and burritos that are made-to-order result in a great tasting meal.  The spicy BBQ sauce is mouth watering and sweat inducing....  While it is similar to Chipotle  Qdoba  and others....it is different  and in my opinion  better 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,442,These burritos have to be the best combination of fresh tortillas and fillings in town..  Chipolte and Freebirds don t even come close..
Cabo Bob's Burritos,443,Love me some cabo bobs. Although I normally always get a salad I always order a side of their smoked cheddar tortilla  DELICIOSO   OH and their sweet mint tea is a must for me  super refreshing.  Everything is fresh and the meat is tasty  Our office comes frequently  we definitely love it here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,444,Absolutely amazing  first find here and hands down never doing chipotle or free birds again . Awesome service . Guy who s worked there 4 years that served me is outstanding   Props
Cabo Bob's Burritos,445,The BEST burritos on west campus. From the specialty  in-house made tortillas to the delicious hot sauce  mango salsa  and queso this place is always a delight to eat. The customer service is spectacular and I love the local drink selection on their fountain. The restaurant is beautiful and well conceived. There is a reason I make a point of eating here once a week.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,446,WOOOOOW  this place is delicious. I went here yesterday and I ordered queso nachos with onions  chicken  and jalape os. I must go back the next time I come to Austin. This place is a winner   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,447,Cabo s is a great alternative to Chipotle or Freebird s. I ve had the burrito and salad  both are great  I like that Cabo s has more options for toppings than other places. They also serve a variety of seafood proteins if you are into that. Cool atmosphere too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,448,It s so amazing that in a 2 day trip  Hubby and I are already addicted. I can t believe that we don t have this place in Dallas. I will be craving these burritos when I am at home  and helped further sway my law school decision. The ingredients  fresh  the employees  friendly  the burrito beyond OFF THE CHAIN   . The flavors in each component is well thought out  and the combinations of flavors are just mind blowing. The Mango Pico is so good that I could eat a bowl full  and the Baja beans  just magnificent. Kudos to Cabo Bob s for sharing these recipes with Texas. I ll be dreaming for you tonight   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,449,The atmosphere is really relaxed with some cool decor.  All the food is really fresh and really tasty.  The prices are great for the amount of food you get.  We can t wait to come back here.  This place is pretty loud so keep that in mind if you want to get done good talking done.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,450,I CAN NOT EVEN TELL YOU HOW EXCITED I AM     That they opened a place in the city. We always had to drive down south and now we have one in our back yard     They will be seeing more of us    I just wish all the money i spend there would go towards stocks     Love their food.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,451,Great quality food. One of my favorite places to go. Facility could be managed better but staff is always helpful and friendly.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,452,Good tacos  but the portions are structured for men. You can t order any less than 3 tacos at a time. I feel horrible about throwing away half my food...so I don t eat here.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,453,Literally the worst experience of my life. I found 3 cockroaches in my burrito and my girlfriend broke up with me on the restaurant. The bathroom had no toilet paper when I had to go number two  and I got a grain of rice stuck in between my two front teeth. I don t recommend this place.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,454,I was so excited to see that Cabo Bobs opened another location  and its close to my office. I am officially obsessed with this place. Chipotle cream and queso are absolute musts. This location doesn t seem to be busy yet. Hurry up and check out this place before it gets as crowded as the other location
Cabo Bob's Burritos,455,Delicious  I m not a huge fan of burrito type places but this place is so good  I get the fish burrito on the cilantro tomatillo tortilla. Do it. You ll be thankful.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,456,High quality ingredients  Flavors are better than Chipotle. It s locally owned  and they have three locations now. The owners are very nice and hard-working     The restaurant stays really busy  but the lines move at a good pace. They are excellent to use for catering for large groups. I ve used them many times  and they are always prompt and there are no mistakes with the order. I highly recommend Cabo Bob s  
Cabo Bob's Burritos,457,Sooo much better than Chipotle or Qdoba  The tortilla is cooked and pressed right in front of you  they offer more ingredients that are fresher  and the customer service is great. If you haven t been to Cabo Bob s yet you need to GO 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,458,This is absolutely one of my favorite places. It is similar to Freebirds and Chipotle. Both of which are good imo. However this place blows my mind. So Beach Bum bob will make you a burrito. You choose the stuff and he piles it in. Everything tastes fresh and has a good taste. The hot sauce they offer is mouth burning delicious. The cane sugar sodas are a great add on. I love the cream soda. I dont fall in love with too many places but I love cabo bobs. I hate to write this review because this location is not as busy and I can get my food quick. But like Bob would say  share the love bro . Thanks Bob 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,459,So far one of my favorite burrito places in Austin. It s a franchise  but there are a lot of options and overall  the food is fresh. It s slightly cheaper than chipotle and qdoba  which are it s competitors  but the concept of the restaurant is the same.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,460,The best  build your own  burrito place in Austin. The owner is a great guy  and their staff is awesome. But it s their ingredients that set them apart from other places like Freebirds or Chipotle. Their mesquite grill does wonders on their meats  and the fried fish and fresh made tortillas are my favorite. Mostly the food can be 5 stars but sometimes it can be 4 stars. But it is delish no matter what.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,461,Best burritos Ever in Austin. Super fresh ingredients. The made to order tortillas are so good. My B F and I split it in 3rds. Will never do burritos anywhere else. Awesome soda fountain too.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,462,I LOVE CABO BOB S    This place is WAY better than Chipotle because their meat is more fresh and tender and they have QUESO   The tortillas are fresh  warm like you want and they try their hardest to be efficient and fast  which is why I will wait even if there s a line out the door. I love this place    
Cabo Bob's Burritos,463,Cabo has the best burritos in Austin. The fresh flavored tortilla does it for me. They are always polite  quick  and consistent. I will prefer a burrito from here over Chipotle or Qdoba any day.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,464,Great variety in toppings veggies and tortillas are pressed fresh right before your eyes. Very good selection of sauces and beverages as well. Great  deliciously affordable burritos  bowls  and tacos.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,465,This is a great and awesome place for Vegetarians. This place beats Chipotle  free birds when it comes to options for veggies. They have great and friendly staff who are the best. I would have this 2-3 days of the week without getting bored.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,466,very fresh and flavorful.  i love that they have fish options too and your tortillas are freshly grilled.  the options are endless   the quality good.  beef was tender.  fish was crispy.  AND.. the price was very reasonable.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,467,Pretty damn solid. It s amazing that it took people so long to beat chipotle. The fish tacos are particularly good.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,468,fan-freakin-tastic.  I agree with Tony F. Best Burrito in Austin.  I want one right now.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,469,So glad I went to Cabo Bob s because the tortillas are so delicious. Burrito places usually all taste pretty similar to me but Cabo Bob s burritos have a distinct taste. I ve only tried the cilantro tortilla but I want to try the others next time I go. The burritos are so filling and the chicken is great and so are the beans and the prices are so fair  especially for what you re getting. Can t believe I went almost three years of living near it and never went. Also  they have Jarritos sodas which are my favorite. Don t forget to get a little punch card. I am 5 burritos away from getting a free burrito.   
Cabo Bob's Burritos,470,Fresh  quick  and delicious  The food puts Chipotle and Qdoba to shame. The tortilla is cooked when you order it  making it all the better. It s awesome 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,471,Tortillas made fresh while you watch  The food is fresh and tasty and they use quality ingredients. Love the brisket  amp  queso burrito and love that all the sodas are Dublin sodas made with real sugar.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,472,This place is delicious and the staff is friendly. I work across the street  the only things that stops me from going more often is that I m embarrassed that I go so much already. Best burrito in the city hands down
Cabo Bob's Burritos,473,One of the top burritos in Austin.   Fresh tortillas.  A good selection of ingredients that work well together.  Killer chips.  The only negative is that they only have hipster sodas on the fountain.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,474,I recently visited Cabo Bob s in west campus two weeks ago and was an immediate fan  their  subway  style burrito taco bar is fresh and simple. I love this new addition of an Austin favorite to west campus. Student priced quality food that fills you up  Great staff  quick and efficient. Keep it up 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,475,I had read several reviews on Yelp and I was expecting a delicious burrito that represented SoCal. A burrito that taste better than Chipotle. Maybe my expectations were too high  but my fish burrito was just average. The taste of food was overall  blah.  I feel that the food lacked seasoning. However  the tortilla was delicious. I enjoyed watching them make and cook the tortilla. There was a lot of potential for this place. It had a nice atmosphere but ultimately it was just another burrito and I still prefer my chipotle.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,476,Really good food at affordable rates. I use the Hooked app when I go and they always have great discounts on there. Their burritos are huge and their sauces are great.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,477,went to Cabo Bobs restaurant on Rio Grande and had a very unpleasant experience. I LOVE Cabo Bobs and when my boyfriend and I needed to grab a bite it seemed like an obvious choice. We did realize that the restaurant was closing in 45 mins but because it is typically quick and we were taking our food to go  we figured this would be a non-issue. When we ordered our tortillas  I went first  the man making them was extremely rude. I understand that it was within an hour of closing which may make an employee upset so I gave him a little slack and continued with my burrito making process. I was out of earshot when my boyfriend ordered and we got our food and left. When we got in the car my boyfriend asked me what  pinche cabron  meant. Being from a border town I instantly knew that it loosely translated to  f   ing a  hole  and asked him why. It was then that I was informed that the man making tortillas said that to my boyfriend after he ordered. I ve worked in the food industry and I understand a little rudeness but that is completely unacceptable. We were in and out 45 minutes before closing time. I am shocked and offended that an employee would behave in such a manner and treat a grateful paying customer like that. The rest of the staff was great  super friendly  helpful  kind  personable etc. but this tortilla man needs to be reprimanded at the least if that is the way he is going to treat people.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,478,I do appreciate the fresh tortillas. That being said  I did not like Cabo Bob s. I ordered the  2 fish taco meal  and it was very bland. My husband got a burrito with briskest and it was very dry. Probably won t be back.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,479,There is one thing I ABSOLUTELY HATE about this place  and that is that it is not open on Sundays  I haven t been to another burrito place since my first time here  it s just not worth the time or the money anymore. You are very VERY generously served and the tortillas are something else.  The sauces  meats  toppings  are all perfect 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,480,cheap  pretty good burritos tacos with a fish option. they make their own tortillas. my greatest regret when I lost my wallet was losing the burrito punch card...just one punch away...nevermore
Cabo Bob's Burritos,481,It is really rare when I give out 5 s but this place definitely deserves it. The environment is a unique experience and probably one of my favorite restaurant atmosphere I have seen. It really feels like I near a beach side. The music here is nice and soothing  and adds on more to the atmosphere. The food and price here is worth the value. The ingredients are fresh  and the beef fajita I had tasted authentic. Overall  this place beats the heck out of chipotle. The reason being is that the ingredients taste fresher  the size of the burrito is larger  and the have queso to add on too  Plus  they give many more scoops than chipotle. This place is definitely not stingy. Another reason why this place is exceptional is their customer service. They were super friendly and let us try samples. I loved the customer interaction... Chipotle definitely doesn t have this. If I had a choice to pick Cabo Bob s  Chipotle  or Qdoba  I would pick Cabo Bob s all day everyday. Keep up the work 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,482,I never write reviews of any restaurants because there just aren t that many which are completely notable. So here goes.... If you eat at Cabo Bob s  you will judge the remainder of your life as B.C. and A.C.--before Cabo s and after Cabo s. The tortillas are hand-pressed on the spot and far outshine any that I ve ever eaten. Think  Mi Tierra  in San Antonio  this place is incredible  I had ancho chili with chicken and creamy chipotle sauce  it was the best burrito I ve ever eaten. Chipotle and Freebirds do not compare. Do yourself a favor and go eat one 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,483,Better than Freebirds  the tortillas are made fresh in house and not pulled out of a wrapper. Brisket and queso is amazing  fish tacos are great  its just all fantastic 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,484,Great food  quick and good service. The only knock is they aren t open on Sundays.
Cabo Bob's Burritos,485,Really  really good. We are big fans of all the other burrito places too  but this one is worth writing a review for. The flavor is different. I ate an entire burrito in one sitting  something I normally have the will power not to do   love the option to add veggies  everything was fresh  we will be going again and again 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,486,I would have given 5 stars buts they seems to have a problem cooking rice. I v been there twice and both times the rice was soooo undercooked. Like hard and crunchy...not just a little chewy. I never ate at the one south so I don t know if this is just how it is with them. There were 6 of us and all felt the same about the rice. May try again. But no rice 
Cabo Bob's Burritos,487,I LOVE cabo bob s  I love the guac and queso and their chips yumm. Cabo Bob s will always get a 5 star from me
