Mario's Seafood,1,Standard Tex-Mex food.  The cheese enchiladas are good as well as the salsa. They make really good drinks here and have great customer service. We will be back.
Mario's Seafood,2,We were in the mood for seafood and Mario s popped up  so we decided to give it a try. It was lunchtime for us and mama was getting hangry  so her order needed to be hot and correct.   Well....they got the hot right but they fried her fish instead of grilling it  as requested  Then later we figured out they forgot her side of tortillas. She was too hungry to give it back  so she ate it like that. She said it was ok and wouldn t come back but my hubby on the other hand said he wants to give it another try because they were out of oysters  due to the storms down south  so he would like to go back for those.   He had Nayarit ceviche and a caldo that was too spicy for my tio but when he had it he said it was ok  taste was off. He also had a michelada that was good.   I had Rellenos  stuff jumbo shrimp  with shrimp fried rice. Shrimp was delicious but rice was ok. I also had a drink  I believe was the Cantita in a cute ceramic mug and it was tasty.   We all had some appetizers of Calamari and Tostada Mazatleca-ceviche. They were good but Nothing really stood out for me except the stuffed shrimp and drink.   Some of their prices are a little much with certain items but overall  expect to have a pricey bill because it is seafood.   Our server Erika was nice and friendly. The rest of the staff seemed productive. It would have been nice to have been offered a discount or a comp for the mess ups but it didn t happen. That bathrooms were clean and they provided seating right away even for a group of nine.   Overall  It was a decent experience. I ll probably go back when hubby wants to try the oysters.
Mario's Seafood,3,Stopped in for some oysters and margaritas. Unfortunately they were out of oysters which made my heart sad. We spoke with the bartender as I m gluten and dairy intolerant. He wasn t knowledgeable about my food issues but was super helpful on finding something to meet my needs. I decided on the shrimp tostada. I told him if I see something that doesn t meet my needs my husband can eat it. The tostada came out and was delish. I would recommend getting one per person in the future. The drinks were strong and delicious. We had Mexican martini and margaritas. Overall a cool chill pass. I would love to come back and try more food and drinks.
Mario's Seafood,4,C mon man....  Not a hater  just a true review and being generous with the stars  Been driving by this place for months wanting to find a reason to stop for some Mexi-style seafood  amp  oysters  Understand its desperate  tough times and thank you for being open. but dang man  y all gotta get some things right if you re gonna take peoples money   Seems like you been outta oysters for awhile now  at least put a sign up if I have to wait for service  Stale crackers  Throw that shit out  man  they only cost like  7 a box   Get your bar cleaned up  makes customers think everything else is dirty  don t need to wait till the end of the night to clean  Fried fish was fresh and cooked perfectly but not sure exactly what type of fish it was  seafood cocktail was as expected  nothing unique  Sorry but I didn t find anything intriguing or able to recommend here  not even basic cantina food truck level need to step up your game for the pricing  I guess you can draw business from the nearby hotels  Would like to try again if you re still open in the future
Mario's Seafood,5,Don t listen to these haters. You have to be a sad  sad person to leave bad reviews for a place that just opened. I had a bomb ass meal here tonight. Lemme tell you about it.  Mario s Seafood serves up LEGIT mariscos  seafood  in the old Applebees. Honestly  this is one of the best trades ever for the Austin food scene. We ve really needed some quality ceviche  and Applebees  I m not even going to go there.  The shrimp coctel was absolutely killer. Some of the best I ve had. It was super fresh and a nice portion. Bits of habanero and some other spice I couldn t identify  but was all about. Had camarones zarandeados and a couple big pieces of pepino on the side. So artfully presented    My aguachile negro mixto was also great. The mixto version comes with oysters and scallops  which pair great with the shrimp. I recommend getting the mixto instead of the regular aguachile. And the spice - it was spicy  like an aguachile negro should be  but not overwhelming. My mouthburn steadily incremented throughout my meal  but I finished all of it. I was sweating a little at the end  but it was sooo good   All of the mariscos were tender  flavorful and FRESH  which is the most important thing with mariscos. My wife s michelada was bien hecha tambien.   Downsides - prices seem to be all over the place. Some things are priced right  some things seem a few bucks too high. But for quality ceviche in Austin  I m not complaining.   Looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu  and SOON 
Mario's Seafood,6,Don t let the old reviews get to you  this place has some of the best birria tacos I ve ever had. The place has great music   they play bad bunny     host amazing events  and staff was super kind. You can t find many authentic Mexican restaurants in Austin but this is one of them
Mario's Seafood,7,English review at bottom  Buena comida  presios relativamente bien  buena musica. La rason por la que no puedo recomendar este lugar es por el pesimo servicio recibido. Al mesero se le dio barias oportunidades de reconsiderar su pesima actitud ya que lo tratamos con respeto y cortesia. Consumimos  195 y despues de esperar la cuenta por mas de 20 minutos el mesero llega con solo una cantidad para pagar. Me entrega el aparato para pagarle y casualmente esta en la opci n de propina. Yo le pico al aparato y descubro que mi total de  245 ya venia con una generosa propina de  40. Al preguntarle por que me estaba sugiriendo propina adicional  act a ofendido  me arrebata el aparato y termina la transacci n sin siquiera darme recibo. Que decepci n que el apoyar a un negocio latino tenga como consecuencia un mal servicio y possible estafa.   Food was decent. Prices are okay. Music good. The reason I cannot recommend this place is due to the poor service we got from our server. Seemed in a hurry and dismissive. Felt like a burden to the waiter. Consumed  195 and after waiting over 20 min for our check  we got a waiter that basically told us an amount without any check to show for it. Noticed the waiter helped himself to a  43 tip  undestandable since we comsumed roughly  200  What I dont appreciate is the fact that after you ve assumed a gratuity then you ask  or trick me into an additional tip. Unfortunately waiter s poor service has cost you a customer.
Mario's Seafood,8,Great seafood wife had the full fish and excellent beef fajita for me appetizer was wow shrimp cocktail and calamari highly recommended clean and friendly staff
Mario's Seafood,9,Great atmosphere and delicious meal. El Salvadorian dishes are tasty with complex flavors.  Tried the ceviche   fish taco and shrimp tacos with a lovely aeole sauce.
Mario's Seafood,10,I have been waiting for this place to open. We had originally planned for hot wings next door but saw Mario s seafood was open so decided on that instead. The waitresses were nice but super close to us  probably to hear since the music was SUPER LOUD . My bf ordered a frozen Margarita but they didn t have frozen so he ordered it on the rocks which came in a small glass. I order Mexican Martini which was really good. My bf ordered Filete de pescado which looked nothing like the picture. He said it was alright but not for the price. I ordered the A la Bahia but they ran out of Oysters. So I decided on the Rellenos jumbo stuffed shrimp which came with shrimp fried rice  no flavor  and cold. Not worth the price  I don t think we will go back. I wish them luck.
Mario's Seafood,11,This place has the worst service that I have ever gone to I will never go to this place again it will never be good the food is always cold there is never a good weight are there in the management is terrible to speak with. Lleve a mi esposa y mi suegra a pasar un agradable 10 de mayo y lo que resivieron un mal servicio y mi esposa se sali  asta llorando de el coraje que mi suegra casi no la sacamos por que es ya una persona de cuidados especiales
Mario's Seafood,12,Not what we expected  I think they need to have at least some tostadas to start munching on  the portions on the plates are small I know it s seafood but please you have Pappadeux prices  like the JUMBO Shrimp comes with 6 poorly stuffed 31 35 size shrimp you can see the picture   not jumbo  21 25  at all but anyways  they have flavor  good luck   
Mario's Seafood,13,Atmosphere is good. I love the music  food service is very slow  even though it s not that busy.Unfortunately we had to send our appetizer back twice  first a hair in our dish and second time didn t accommodate our request..The restroom needs to be stocked  and restroom stalls need trash cans. That was very inconvenient for me today. The food honestly was not good  from the hair to the slimy nopales on our molcajetero  including old hard corn tortillas  taste and portion was bad. Especially for the price they charge. Mostly everything didn t not seem fresh  our first and that will definitely be our last sorry guys  you should definitely concern serving chip and salsa for the long wait.
Mario's Seafood,14,This is more for drinks and appetizers kind of place. Don t order the shrimp fajitas because they serve it with the whole shell on it  never have I gone to a restaurant where you have to peel the shrimp before you eat it. That s just a lazy cook. I don t see myself coming back
Mario's Seafood,15,This place is great  The ceviche and bacon wrapped shrimp is are just excellent  I ordered the quesadilla gobernador which was also amazing. Even the non seafood options are really good. Also the staff is super friendly 
Mario's Seafood,16,DO NOT EAT HERE  Came to eat and got a boot put on my car. Had to pay  100 for their staff to remove the boot to go home. I went to watch the soccer game  have food and drinks and walked across the street to Ojos for an hr. Came back to my car and found a boot on it. A paying customer of their mediocre seafood restaurantp shouldn t have to worry about leaving their car in their parking lot. What if I had to uber home or my car had broken down and I had to leave it there   Terrible business model 
Mario's Seafood,17,This place refused to offer access to any of their wifi networks for customer use
Mario's Seafood,18,ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES ROACHES ALL OVER THIS PLACE  The hostess was super fast and friendly  the waiter was friendly nice guy  while i was eating with my family a roach crawls at the wall do i killed with a napkin  of course that ruined my whole food and experience  i handle this to someone at the staff  and requested to speak with the manager  OH GOD with s bad attitude she approached to us and asked whats wrong i told her if she can review her cameras bcs i killed a roach  she asked me  that was on your food  -i was like for real    I said no was next to it in the table  and her very smart answer was WE ARE HANDLING THAT ISSUE     Instead of being mad i laugh i told her that is against the state of Texas Health Department Codes  you shouldn t serve food or provide services if you have roaches  and she started arguing back to me  how she could be a manager if she haven t skills or professionalism how to handle this issues  your defend yourself more if you stay quiet  HOPE THE OWNERS GET PEST CONTROL to ride of the roaches and the manager  Bathrooms were dirty  so sad to see a big investment and the employees careless
Mario's Seafood,19,The food was honestly very good. I recommend the shrimp tacos and the shrimp ceviche. Even the fried rice that came with the tacos was delicious.
Mario's Seafood,20,I wanted to try this place so bad  service was okay  but honestly is not as good as I thought it would be.  What I didn t like  it was that when they charge you they already had selected   added  the tip. I don t really mind tipping but I m not talking about them adding  5  10 dollars I m talking about  35 dollars that was really disappointing  and really bad costumer service too.
Mario's Seafood,21,P simo servicio una hora esperando la comida y las bebidas una limonada con un vidrio a dentro no lo recomiendo y la mesera trajo dos platos y unos patino es don tenedores ni platos la disque manager arreglando seg n ella y dejamos toda la comida por que estas personas dan p simo servicio cuando trajeron los tenedores y las tortillas mi mojarra u el disquete el mil ajete estaban fr os no sirve no lo recomiendo
Mario's Seafood,22,Really good 10 10 Service 10 10 Also love how they social distance the tables around her all this place is GREAT.  Este lugar es 10 10 en todo   La comida deliciosa   El servicio maravilloso 
Mario's Seafood,23,Very good new spot in town.  I almost feel like I want to keep it to myself  but plenty of room there for all of us   The food drinks were quality and the setup  lots of tvs  looks perfect for an Austin FC game. I had the Chamoy Mango Margarita and Aguachile Ceviche.  There are fajita options if you don t like seafood  but the menu is nothing like you ll see around town and fun to explore.  Fresh food  great service  and the place has a nice atmosphere. I ll definitely be back and recommend Mario s.
Mario's Seafood,24,Waiter spoke some English  but not very good.  I asked for a Margarita on the rocks and got frozen instead.  Didn t complain  was just hard to drink.  Menu said one of the fish could be fried or grilled  my husband asked for grilled and waiter said they only fry it.  So he ordered a different type of fish that came grilled.  It was okay  but had no flavor.  I ordered grilled shrimp with vegetables.  The shrimp flavor was tasty  but it still had the shells.  It was very messy pulling them off.  Had to ask for more napkins from the hostess because our waiter never came back.  The vegetables  I only got two pieces of broccoli and 3 large slices of carrots.  My husband should have had fries  he got the same vegetables.  I did like the shrimp rice.  While we only had our drinks  the hostess and another person came by to ask if we were doing okay.  Of course after we got our meals  no one came to check on us.  Music and atmosphere was nice  but won t be going back.
Taco Cabana,1,Always love this place  - but can you get the darn Rewards Scanner working       Workers are all so nice and helpful at this location   Since you have been bought by another company keep things going the same way.  Pay these folks well and they will make your company Grand .     Thank you.  Happy.
Taco Cabana,2,One of the worst TCs in Austin. I have been here probably a million times over the last 20 years and their quality has gone INCREDIBLY downhill. They will fuck up your order and will never answer the phone. The fact that they have online ordering with no drive thru option but then lock the door so you can t go inside and pick up your order    Insane. Rude employees who hate their job and want to make sure you hate your experience too. Get a different job if you don t want to work here. Every employee in this building is focused on how to avoid doing their job.   Do NOT go here. Seriously. Do not go here. Go to the Whataburger next door or Don s down the road if you re really needing your breakfast taco fix.
Taco Cabana,3,My brother came in from out of town for a quick Thanksgiving visit. He used his credit card at only one location during his trip - the drivethru at this Taco Cabana. And guess what  That card was scammed and charged up around Austin. My family is currently trying to get in touch with management but have had no luck thus far. Customers beware 
Taco Cabana,4,You can t eat inside sign says pick up only  frustrating we don t want to eat in our car or take it home.
Taco Cabana,5,Condescending drive though employee.  I WILL NEVER COME BACK 10 14 22 1 41PM.  Food is like they just don t care.
Taco Cabana,6,GROSS  Went this morning for my off-the-menu Huevos Rancheros. NO MORE  The manager seemed pleased to disappoint. Horrible service  no one wants to work. All employees were servicing the drive through and I had to wait quite a while to even be acknowledged. Ordered Huevos Mexicanos. Eggs were very watery and COLD  potatoes were cold and STALE like  they were left over from yesterday. Had to beg for one pitiful salsa. Sad bc they used to have one of the best Ranchero sauces in town with nice cumin accent. I guess  like everything else  it s just too much trouble and since not on menu it s easy to axe. Stomach had been upset all day. RUN 
Taco Cabana,7,Terrible employees with bad attitudes. I m never going back. Mumbling through the drive through... tossing the food at you with an aggressive attitude... terrible
Taco Cabana,8,I asked for Mexican nachos and we get Tex mex nachos instead. The girl at the window doesn t even let us know. I was fine with it but the nachos aren t enjoyable since all the chips were crushed. I had no fork at all. If they had no chips they could ve let us know instead of serving us crushed chips.
Taco Cabana,9,I couldn t hear what the gentleman in the drive thru was saying. When I asked if he was ready he responded condescendingly  telling me he s been waiting on me.
Taco Cabana,10,I ordered my food thru the drive thru and when I got to the window the lady didn t say a single word to me  handed me my food and closed the window in my face as I tried telling her I had ordered a drink as well. I waited a few minutes for her to realize I was still there and open the window so I could get my drink and when she finally opened the window she just stared at me so I said she forgot my drink and she closed the window in my face again. She brought my drink and said bye after she handed it to me. I will absolutely never go to this taco cabana again. This happened today  Sunday  January 2  2022 at 3 45 pm.
Taco Cabana,11,I don t know what s going on with this TC. In the past it s been a good place to get a quick bite but here lately they are struggling. There was only 2 ladies doing both drivethru and front of the  house. The food was good I had the new buffalo chicken bowl and my daughter had the chicken flautas with guac. The buffalo sauce has a kick so be careful  I asked for the new RumRunner but she said they didn t have any. No margaritas either  I stopped last week on Saturday and the same. Giving them 3 stars because the food hoping they can fix the marg problem  
Taco Cabana,12,If I could leave zero stars  I would. This TC is not deserving of one star  it is pitiful. Ordered online and went to pick up at the counter  only to be told they did not have enough food to fill the order. All we ordered was one lb of steak fajita and one lb of chicken fajita. When we asked them just to fill what they could  they refused and told us we needed to go online to cancel the order because they couldn t do it at the store. Needless to say  there is no way to cancel the order online. I called customer service and they told me they could not cancel my order but would instead take my information and send it to the department that issues refunds. So. Now I have to wait for a refund from an order I never even received. When I asked for the direct number to the refund department  I was told  they don t have one.  I am at a loss. This is a national company and they can t cancel or refund my order that they refused to fill  Pathetic.
Taco Cabana,13,I m not a habitual Yelper  but I have complained about this place multiple times. I only eat here because it s their closest one to my house   I ve been a customer there for 18 years. In the past they have messed up my order LITERALLY around 100 times in a row.  Tonight I got to the drive thru and said  just one second please.  She sighed and said  in classic annoyed valley girl voice   Well we close at 10 so uuhhhh yeah...  Basically telling me to hurry. I told them nevermind  and as I drove by the girl and the curly haired guy working the window both flipped me off in front of the other customers in the drive thru. I m sick of this sh t  This place is losing a customer that s eaten there 3 times a week for 18 years. Here s a finger for you  Have some pride in your work. Stop hiring losers.
Taco Cabana,14,6 23 20 at 11 04AM  Order   424741  Hungry. As hindsight is 20 20  I should ve stuck with my  gut  to go elsewhere. But  I was late to work  this TC was on the way  and I reasoned with myself to go ahead with Taco Cabana this time because it was literally  on my way   and prior messages from corporate related that this location would ve improved at least by now  see my prior reviews ..  Um... -SO- NOT OK  AND worse than EVER  WTH    I only ordered 2 chorizo  egg  and cheese breakfast tacos.    1  no pics because I was en route. Made for an interesting drive as I was throwing parts of the tacos out the window as I drove...  2  I was looking forward to TC s homemade tortillas... Aren t they supposed to be freshly made  My experience  CRUNCHING into a soft flour breakfast taco    Wait  It gets worse  The other side of the taco was complete MUSH... I m not talking chorizo grease  folks. It was as though the tortilla was laid in a puddle of water when being  filled.  Oh wait  Then there s that too  Where s the filling  All nasty tortilla and 1 small mouthful of filling    I honestly have zero clue how ANYONE could serve a taco of that quality  GARBAGE    3 Worst breakfast tacos ever  Dude  Whataburger s breakfast taquitos with watery eggs are better than what I was served.  I hate that this location is closest to me and it sucks 99.9  of the time.   8 2 2020  ARGH    Keep hoping they ll be better. Keep getting severely disappointed. Messed up my husband s order. 1 nugget of chicken fajita meets your entire daily intake of sodium. The rice was disgusting  tasteless mush. Tortilla bowl  overcooked  hard. Yeah  there s nothing at all good about this location time  amp  time again. Seriously  WTH     
Taco Cabana,15,WORST Taco Cabana in all of Austin   I guess they choose what they want to serve versus what is listed on the menu. I requested shredded chicken tacos two or three different times and each time they tell me they are all out of shredded chicken. This would make sense if it were close to midnight but it was mid day when I requested it. So I guess when they don t want to make something  they don t.  The next big thing is  the drive-thru. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t. I don t know if it is operator error or if it is they just don t want to actually do their job. But I know that other cars including myself have sat at in the drive-through waiting to be served and the drive-through operator just doesn t want to talk. The last time I was there  they asked me to pull up to the window to make my order. I asked if there was something wrong with the intercom and they said no  that s just the way they like to do it. RIDICULOUS   I shouldn t have to memorize my order while I sit in line... Hopefully another Taco Cabana opens up and puts this one out of business. Or they get new management who can train their night staff to do what they re supposed to do 
Taco Cabana,16,Rude drive thru window lady  no greeting and seemed pissed when I asked for a fork and napkins. Charged me extra for something I didn t order.  Food was cold  and just left feeling like I was a burden just by going there and giving them my money. Will never go to this location again.
Taco Cabana,17,Multiple items in our order were missing from our online order like our can of soda and the sides that were supposed to come with our sopapillas and churros. Thought ordering online would help prevent any sort of communication breakdown that happens over the speaker. One star is for one of two bowls being made correctly.
Taco Cabana,18,I appreciate that I can get in  get out quickly.... or zip through the drive through and then hop on MoPac. I m rather fond of the crispy beef tacos 
Taco Cabana,19,Went to the drive-through at 5 30 PM. Ordered two quesadillas with pico on the side. Seems like a simple order right  I pull over and check my food both quesadillas have pico on them. I go to the door  it s locked. I tried to call inside as there are now about 10 cars in the drive-through. A guy comes to the door and says what s the problem ma am  To which I respond both of these have pico on them and I asked for pico on the side. He takes them and closes the door. Comes back about five minutes later and says if you want us to remake them it s going to take 10 minutes. I asked why would it take 10 minutes  He says we have too many orders so it s going to take 10 minutes unless you want to take it like it is. No refund or compensation offered. I say to him what s the alternative and he says you should just take it like it is.    No sir   I need you to remake them and bring them to my car.. THANKS     Why is customer service not important these days   
Taco Cabana,20,This Taco Cabana drive-thru has gone seriously downhill. Today I ordered a Cabana Sampler  two quesadillas  one large and one kid size   and two bean and cheese tacos. It took forever to order because they were only taking one order at a time and then making the food  handing out  and then they would take the next order. I received the two quesadillas in one box  but no pico  sour cream  or guacamole  which should have come with the large quesadilla. I finally got my Cabana Sampler  which I m attaching a photo of. There s usually sauce  lettuce  and guacamole with it. Finally  I had to remind them that I had ordered two bean and cheese tacos. I had to wait for almost 5 minutes for two tacos. And with that  I m done with this location. If I want Taco Cabana I ll drive to the 2117 W Ben White location.   I used to frequent Taco Cabana because Whataburger usually takes forever. Whataburger is now officially faster. The guy who was in the drive-thru line behind me sat there for 10 minutes after I ordered. He couldn t get a response  so he finally drove off. Sorry  TC. It looks like you lost two customers today.
Taco Cabana,21,Decided to give this location another chance since   a  they re close by   b  they re on the way to most anything  and  c  Jonesing guacamole.  Their guac is quite good  actually  and it s fresh  but I prefer the hairless kind that I get 2 3rds of the time.  Something to try are the egg and brisket breakfast tacos. They re small but overstuffed with both egg and brisket  and  unlike my previous adventures in bacon egg tacos at this location  the brisket is delish.  Something to skip here is the key lime pie. While it s not horrible  there s not much key in the lime. You wind up with essence of key lime pie  not the real deal.
Taco Cabana,22,This particular Taco Cabana would have much higher ratings and LOTS of business if they would open their dining room. Particularly for the very very very many Businesses  both retail and administrative  nearby. there are so many employees of these businesses that would love to patronize this particular Taco cabana  but because it is not open to foot traffic AT ALL... not even for pick up and eating OUTSIDE on their very large patio which remains empty  not to mention the cavernous inside which has been sitting empty for over a year ... they are passed over time and time again. I particularly can count over 30 to 50 times I would have walked over on my lunch break in the past year... and I know there many more like me. Get it together  open up... you are off a major highway for goodness sake 
Taco Cabana,23,Earned the low rating bc they re JUST like other Taco Cabanas with lousy attention to order completeness and food prep.  See the photo- this undersized  underfilled bean and cheese taco. So disappointing. I m really resentful of giving my business to places like this  they only continue to diminish in overall quality as the years go by.  I also asked for a side that I found out later was NOT bag  when I was in the drive through line  the checkout girl looked me right in the eye and said  Yes  when I asked   Is everything in the bag    What s the deal 
Taco Cabana,24,Terrible service      Ordered take out and it looked like pig food. I ordered without the beans and rice only on bed of lettuce and there was a few pieces of meat. I ordered guacamole and I can t even see it in the food. I returned it and asked for refund and the staff was rude and even argued that she put extra meat and the guacamole was already added in the plate. Don t know what she meant by guacamole because there wasn t any  not a trace.  Never again 
Taco Cabana,25,The freshly made tortillas are fantastic- a 5 star rating  But the service here is so pathetic  it s a negative 3 star.  They wrap poor  don t pack very well. I had to wait for 45 mins past the agreed order pickup time  inspite of one day notice  Duhhh
Taco Cabana,26,No napkins no salsa no fork. You give me a SPOON to eat enchiladas with through the drive through. forgot to give me my drink. Be better.  Do better.  Train employees to be better-not turn their backs as they hand you your credit card and receipt.  Disappointing.  It doesn t have to be fancy. Just courtesy.
Taco Cabana,27,The workers are standing around and chatting. Forgot my order  had to wait 20 minutes for simple bacon potato breakfast tacos and see my picture 
Taco Cabana,28,This is the worst run and slowest Taco Cabana I ve consistently been to. The drive thru is messed up every time and takes forever  even early in the morning on the weekend. Three people in line and I ve been waiting ten minutes just to place my order this morning as an example. Hire some more staff and fix the problem.  Edit  30 minutes and waiting to get breakfast tacos at 8am on Saturday.
Taco Cabana,29,Taco Cabana   When I order Beyond Meat tacos  what part of the fact that I am a vegetarian do you not understand   They got the crispy part of the taco shell  but it was filled with ground beef   I actually used to like this place - but recently it appears that no one is paying attention to the customer.  Soggy   ground beef  tacos that my son wouldn t even eat.  I expected higher standards and have continually been disappointed.
Taco Cabana,30,I know it s COVID  but when you repeat your order twice and they repeat back to you and you repeat again at the window  and the order is wrong  it s not COVID s fault. There only one person behind me in line. I asked  my flauta plate is in that small bag along with the other order  and she states  yes . She then hands me my receipt wrapped around my card. Pulled over to read receipt  flauta combo  not what I ordered. I really wanted the rice and beans and flour tortilla. Uhg    
Taco Cabana,31,Consistent food served with fresh ingredients and peanut safe for our son Jake to eat make this  place a good choice for quick meals. The salsa bar provided variety for customer choice depending on your mood for sauce or other. A cold beer always  goes well down well with a taco.
Taco Cabana,32,This place is awful. They always forget something that I ordered and the chips are ALWAYS stale. Haven t had these problems at any other location it seems to just be this location that s sucks  Disgusting and disappointed.
Taco Cabana,33,I am not generally a fan of taco cabana. I took a chance when I only had a short time to grab something for breakfast. 10 45--no breakfast tacos  they stop at 10 30. Crazy. Who wants lunch at 10 45  I settled for their soft beef tacos. There was so much salt in the meat  I spit it out  it was inedible. The refried  beans were also too salty and reeked and tasted of too much comino.   I called and talked to the manager who at first tried to defend his cook. I stopped him and told him to go taste his food. It s that simple.  Lesson learned  I should have gone somewhere else when they said they stopped selling breakfast tacos at 10 30. This is Texas  This is Austin  It s just tacos  There are much better restaurants selling breakfast tacos during breakfast time.   Don t waste your time or money.
Taco Cabana,34,First thing we had to wait too long yo be waited on.  Second they didn t have the chicken special of the week.  Third they were out of forks  The help seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  Not a good visit.
Taco Cabana,35,We got here with no one in the drive through line and looked like no one inside. It took two people to take a single order and after waiting 15 min we finally got our food. We drove off but I wanted to check the food and the quesadilla had little to no chicken and was raw. It looked like a thrown out meal to be honest. Not going back to this one
Taco Cabana,36,Poor customer service  dirty inside  tables are not clean outside  condiment bar is empty and needs to be restocked  and food taco is too salty. What a waste of money 
Taco Cabana,37,We had just landed at the South Terminal at the airport and were craving some quick decent mexican food. We were the only ones in the restaurant at 10 30pm  so it was neat and clean. Our meals were okay  except they forgot to include my cheese enchilada in my meal. I informed them of the mistake and they gladly brought out not one  but two cheese enchiladas. It hit the spot for the time of night and the speed at which we received it.
Taco Cabana,38,I have always loved taco cabana but the past two times I ve ordered from this location I have been let down by the poor quality of food that I have been served. I purchased a few bean and cheese tacos and was surprised to find uncooked refried beans in both batches of tacos. The beans were hard to the point that I actually chipped a tooth while consuming them. I could be wrong but I m fairly certain the refried beans they utilize are just a powder mixture you mix with water. With that being said I ve never had a complaint in the past. On a positive note the tortillas were delicious per usual. If I do decide to return I m fairly certain it will just be to purchase tortillas.
Taco Cabana,39,I waited in line for 10 minutes before anyone even came to the front of the store to take my order. There were literally 2 other people in there eating. I had to wait for an online to-go order I d already paid for  so I couldn t just leave. Just ridiculous.
Taco Cabana,40,Man  Austin has become taco city  which is just fine  but on a Saturday morning  sometimes you want more bite and a taco won t do  it s a burrito kinda hangry.   Went by the local TC to grab some breakfast burritos but much to my chagrin  was informed that TC doesn t serve breakfast burritos as of 1.2.18. Dang  What kind of world is this becoming   But have no fear  The folks at this location heard my plight with sympathetic ears and made me an offer I couldn t refuse. Rather than making a million breakfast tacos for me  they offered to create burritos for me instead and charge me two tacos per one burrito. SOLD.   Now I can have my breakfast burritos and eat them  too.   Thanks  TC on William Cannon and Mopac for excellent customer service and putting your customer s needs first. My belly thanks you    One star off because my side order was a bit wrong  but was quickly corrected when I pointed it out 
Taco Cabana,41,It s been 9 months from covid and you re still drive-thru only   You haven t adapted yet 
Taco Cabana,42,If I could give negative 5 stars I would.  This location is just terrible.  TERRIBLE    I have come here at least 4 times and every time it is the same.  It doesn t matter the manager on duty. At the register they always tell you it will take about 10 minutes to get your food because they do the orders in the order they come in.  So yeah  we waited for ten minutes for 2 bean and cheese tacos.  The cooks were just standing around waiting for something else to finish but never thought to just make the 2 tacos we were waiting for.  Wth    Makes no sense. It never fails  this place always takes forever.  Tonight the possible manager and another employee were being so loud and dancing through the store and then decided to go sit and chill outside while on the clock.  SUPER unprofessional.
Taco Cabana,43,Raw breakfast chorizo served to a customer this morning.  Girl customer in pink scrub top   I saw them put it on heat for less than 8 seconds  then popped it on some breakfast tacos and give it to a girl at 9 45 this morning.  GROSS    Will be calling Health Dept
Taco Cabana,44,I avoid this location specifically and will most definitely travel to a farther one if I just have to have it  ben white location nesr south lamar and manacha is awesome  Bland food here like there s literslly no salt in the beans. Ive had to throw food away on a few occasions because it was that gross. Rude staff. I had to constantly check my bags when I left because I was always being stiffed something.  I have not beem back here in some time and will never go to this location again no matter how hungry I am. NOT worth it.
Taco Cabana,45,Took 30 minutes in the drive thru. Still got my order totally wrong. I get it  it s late. It takes time to cook things. At least give me what I ordered. Or hire literate staff
Taco Cabana,46,This location has gone downhill  I went this morning to order some breakfast tacos and the cashier in the drive-thru window has no customer service. He looked upset never once made eye contact. I waited in line for about 5 min while I was waiting there was 3-4 workers laughing in the back  at one point one of them was throwing the tortilla rolls in the maker while some falling in the ground.  I really hope the owner of this taco Cabana will make changes to improve customer service.
Taco Cabana,47,Worst. Ever. I ve tried multiple times to eat here and service is terrible. They don t get the order right and they swipe your card and then tell you they re out of the thing you ordered...what  I got steak tacos and ALL THAT I GOT ON MY TACO WAS STEAK AND THE TORTILLA. Nothing else. Im making ramen instead because what they gave me was literal shit. Honestly eff this place  stay away and  just go to Taco Bell down the street  you ll thank me.
Taco Cabana,48,They have discontinued our favorite items   Been a loyal and frequent Taco Cabana customer for over 35 years.  That all came to an end this past weekend.  My wife and I were hungry for our favorites  crispy chicken taco  carne guisada taco.  When we ordered  the guy told us these items had been discontinued.  The menu was littered with designer Mexican food crap we care nothing about.  We left.  I recently had crispy beef tacos at the location in Bastrop  TX.  There was so much cumin in the meat that I just tossed the tacos in the trash.  The heavy cumin in the taco meat has been a problem for a long time.  I will never  ever walk into another Taco Cabana.  JK
Taco Cabana,49,I could have chose a better this morning heading into Austin for a meeting in North Austin. I gotta first say and in no relation to the star rating that I was hell bent on Torchy s less than a block away from this TC. Sadly  they didn t open till 7am. So I decided since I had already split with the expressway I would just go for something quick and usually decent.   That s where this Taco Cabana fell short  quick it was not. I placed my order only to realize the Joe before me ordered a million breakfast tacos for his company. A total exaggeration on my part  but it took them almost 20 minutes to make his 4 giant pizza boxes full of tacos with condiments. Then  they basically ran out of food. Employees frantically ran around cooking more eggs  nuking the meats  fluffing the beans  and throwing the tortilla balls on the machine.   25 minutes into my visit they served me my plate without the ranchero sauce  rice that was dry and crunchy  and the worst bacon this side of Whataburger I ve had to date. Another 5 minutes to heat up the ranchero and deliver it to my table. I opted for some free bee cheese that I just had them throw on and settled in for a fairly lame breakfast.   The drive thru was also running slow due to the  big order . One or two employees were left to bang out what three or four could have done in half the time while keeping the dine in and drive thru customers at an even flow.   I scarfed it down hoping to make my meeting  but I think I seriously overpaid for what I got and that s a sad mark when I spent  4.79. Not bad because it was edible  but I m choosing another dining destination the next time I have an early meeting in A-town. That is if I can get my lazy bum outa bed a little earlier
Taco Cabana,50,Wow this place is very unorganized. The cashier was talking to the manager very rudely and was very disrespectful to pretty much all the other employees the whole time we were there. The manager was trying to fix a problem with the tortilla maker and the cashier acted like she was wasting her time. Our food was sitting in the pick up line done but they never called our number so we didn t know if that was our order or not. When we asked the manager if that was our order by the number she said yes that s the number and she asked an employee to please take it to their table and they just dropped it on the table and said here s your order I ve been to many taco cabanas in Austin and San Antonio and they re usually run very well.  I hope this place gets better. I will try it again in the future. But management really needs to make changes.  Especially since there are so many other choices for tacos here in Austin 
Taco Cabana,51,Zero stars. Drive thru 8-31-20 5 45 pm. No salsa with my taco order  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn t give salsa with the taco order  And they didn t even include all my tacos that I ordered and paid for   And no napkins in the bag   Do customers actually have to request salsa and napkins in a drive-through taco order  Do we have to stop and count that everything we paid for is actually in the bag- this is so bad. There are good authentic Mexican food places within a short range of this  and they re priced the same  and they re faster.  And even though there s sometimes a little bit of a language barrier  they get the order right every time  Taking my gringo butt to the good authentic Mexican  places.
Taco Cabana,52,The GM did call me back within an hour  so there. Someone cares  This place has good food  but weirdness like  No Tipping  policy   That doesn t encourage employees to try harder.  When a place is over worked like this one - I usually leave something in the tip jar. Slow service is a man-power issue and a management challenge.  I give them 3 starts for trying and listening to Yelp  
Taco Cabana,53,This Taco Cabana is in serious need of new management. Their employee turn over rate is beyond ridiculous. They always have new employees in here that don t know what they re doing  and they are always hiring and understaffed  Clearly management has not made an effort to make this a desirable place to work  whether it be the work environment  the employee manager relationship  or the pay. Something needs to change.   Today  I came in around 1 30pm and stood in line for about 15 minutes before anyone took care of the guest in front of me. In the mean time  as the guest became increasingly frustrated with the lack of service  the cashier took money from the drawer to go get coin change for the register...but I m not sure what else they were doing that took so long. By the time I was at the resister  there were 4-5 people behind me waiting as well.   I finally ordered  paid  and then went to the restroom to wash my hands. Upon returning  I m informed that they are out of my entree. So they offered me a few different options and I picked one. Food was ready quickly after that. The tortillas were crisp around the edges for some reason  and the rice seemed to be a mixture of old and new.  Nearly every item in the salsa bar was empty.   As I sit here now  there is a man patiently waiting at the front counter for his order to be taken...he has been standing there for 10 minutes because the cashier has been working in the kitchen and is now trying to correct an order they made incorrectly for some other guests here.   Last time I came  the lids  straws  and silverware were empty and food was slow to be made.   This Taco Cabana used to be great  and they have a fantastic location at a major intersection. Changes need to be made  and I am avoiding this location for the foreseeable future.
Taco Cabana,54,Well  things have gone downhill. I tried to use the TC discount code that I was sent  via email  for medical professionals and was rejected and paid full price for tacos that were small lackluster at best.  I was buying tacos for my medical professional  and made that VERY clear to the girls at the window   yet since she WAS NOT IN THE CAR  they couldn t give me the discount   Now  please understand that I typically buy 25-35 dollars in tacos  so in my past few orders  there has never been an issue  but apparently they don t believe you NOW unless you have the NURSE or DOCTOR  with a badge and or scrubs on  in the car with you   After the manager left  the girl at the window suggested that I bring a hospital badge with me to  prove it  next time.  I didn t believe her when she told me that  meaning that it probably will NOT be approved if I actually came in again with a  badge  .  We do have extra badges that I can use to show the girl at the window  but we agreed that moving forward that we just STOP going there and we can make our own tacos from here on out  healthier anyway .  We just dont need the attitude and pissy behavior while we are spending our own money to feed others. We have been through enough crap over the last few months with this COVID stuff  so I guess we can go to McDonalds   1 menu  and load up for breakfast for future breakfast runs for the team.  Perhaps this is why TC is closing stores one at a time in Austin and other Taco places are opening up and taking over 
Taco Cabana,55,I gave it three stars because the service is good and the food is good. It s very clean. But the whole experience dining in was bad because of the moaning bus boy looming for too long nearby .  I appreciate that you were employ the handicapped. However  if they exhibit inappropriate and frightening behavior  they don t need to be near customers and should stay in the kitchens.  The employee was close by my table and moaning for several minutes. I packed the rest of my meal and left.
Taco Cabana,56,Warning  This Taco Cabana does not honor its happy hour specials  at least not from 4-4 30pm.  Supposedly  there s a happy hour here  everyday from 4-7pm  according to multiple signs inside the restaurant. After ordering from the specific happy hour menu and still getting the regular  non-happy hour prices  I spoke to the restaurant manager during said happy hour  and he said that the system clock hadn t yet registered  and that there was nothing he could do about it. So  it s 4 25pm  25 minutes AFTER happy hour has officially started  and the store manager couldn t do anything to honor happy hour  We decided to eat there anyway. About 10 minutes later  another group came in  and the register was apparently ready for happy hour so they ordered similar to what we ordered  but got the happy hour discount.   In short  the happy hour at this Taco Cabana is not very happy at all. In fact  it s a very sad hour when the manager can t even manually honor the happy hour special or even give an equivalent discount. If you must go for happy hour  try going from 4 30-7pm instead. Or better yet  try the next nearest Taco Cabana.
Taco Cabana,57,Got there at 11 57 didn t get our order till 1215 got the fajita plate beans were not done Rice was soggy mushy The guacamole on top was just really bad tried calling the one 800 number 855-893-8226 no one ever answered
Taco Cabana,58,Horrible service  stood and waited 5minutes before someone took our order  no hello of thank you after paying  missing items in order  bathroom disgusting  staff had no motivation at all and could definitely tell by there body language and looks on there faces 
Taco Cabana,59,I ordered a chorizo egg and cheese breakfast taco and a bean and cheese taco. There was less than an entire eggs worth of filling in the chorizo and egg taco  they forgot the cheese  and The tortilla was so dried out that it broke in half when I tried to buy it through the taco... The bean and cheese taco taste like somebody spilled a bottle of perfume in the beans. Inedible.   I wish I could give this taco cabana less than a star.
Taco Cabana,60,Never fails here...I always have to wait 15 minutes or more for my food. Been coming here for years and they continue buen to be the slowest taco cabana on the planet.
Taco Cabana,61,Never going back    I thru 75  out.  75  of my burrito was refried beans.  Yuck yuck yuck.  Shit queso sauce as well.
Taco Cabana,62,Fuuuuuu k this place. How many times have I waited like an idiot in a drive-through line that goes nowhere for 10  15 or more minutes  Well  I just did it again today  for the last time. So ridiculous. Plus they mess up your order half the time.
Taco Cabana,63,So we decided to order Taco Cabana due to nobody felt like cooking and my boys wanted chip and queso  so i figured this was the best choice. I ordered using there app so it be ready when i arrived. Upon arrival took a while to be addressed but when i  was then they ask me what my ordered included and gladly told them. The give me my bags and i leave. I didn t check the bags to see if all my items where there and I SHOULD OF. I didn t get my CHIPS  they gave me CORN toritallas instead of the FLOUR ones that I ordered. I ended up going to the corner store  closes store to me  to buy a bag of chips since   it was to far away to go back and complain. I just was very disappointed in this visit.
Taco Cabana,64,I sent a friend to get hangover preventatives and unfortunately the service was horrible. He had one car in front of him when arriving at the drive thru that took 45 minutes  and he sat in front of the window for another 45 minutes. We got a free quesadilla.
Taco Cabana,65,What s up with this location  I was in line for over over 20 minutes with just 3 cars in front of me. I finally had to bail out of line. No excuse for this and I didn t want to give them my business.....and won t in the future.
Taco Cabana,66,I asked for 4 tacos and sopaillas and asked for honey and dulce de leche  when I get to the window I ask if it s in the bag and the lady goes   I got it   I asked if it was in the bag  she said yeah  and I was like so you got both  And she said yeah  get home and neither are there they are trash workers not that hard to put what the customer asks for in the bag.
Taco Cabana,67,This location serves the great food TC is known for. The problem is that if you try to use the online ordering...it is a joke. I ve tried 3 times  had trouble all 3 and this last time asked for someone to contact me via the TC webpage. Nothing.  I will try online ordering at Manchaca location and see if they are able to handle it.
Taco Cabana,68,Known for fresh Mexican food that was well prepared.  Not this one.  Food mediocre  condiment counter dirty  guacamole turning brown  restrooms dirty  no papertowels in restrooms  order not right  soda dispencer not adjsuted right etc...Disappointed to see a place I loved to eat at drop so low in their standards.  Several other places nearby that would be a better choice.  Pass on this one.  Probably better at other TB ocations but this one needs some TLC and management attention.
Taco Cabana,69,Service was incredibly disappointing and the cashier made short responses that made clear that serving customers was not a priority. I ve worked in the service industry for many years and understand how taxing the job can be but the lack of consistency is unacceptable. I will be going to other locations from now on because the lack of staff and service at this location is disappointing and unsatisfactory.
Taco Cabana,70,7PM  Sunday Night  Drive thru. No one behind me or no one in front. 10 minutes pass and someone tells me that what I ordered wasn t available  then another 10 minutes just to get the food. There was a refund involved which the cashier didn t even offer back to me. I had to ask for it. And that took another 5 minutes to get the refund. UNBELIEVEABLE. That s 25 minutes in a drive thru window. I am FURIOUS     
Taco Cabana,71,Good place to hit it and get it. Not first choice but it will do in a pinch. Tortillas are fresh and fluffy
Taco Cabana,72,Wish I didn t have to give any stars. I ve been coming to this TC for years bc it s close to my house. Over the last few years I have noticed it nosedive in service and management. They seem to be chronically understaffed  the staff barely seems to know what is happening or how to do their jobs  the management is indignant rude to customers for having completely reasonable expectations. For example  today I went in for tacos. The  fresh  salsa bar was missing half the condiments  the salsa ranch was almost empty and looked as if it had turned  and there was no pico. Proper management dictates you prep in advance  if not the night before  how about when you only have a little left and know you will be out soon  I was told it would be thirty minutes to throw some pico together and received a  sorry   shoulder shrug from someone I assume is the manager. Her attitude was so cocky and rude I asked for a refund so I could go someplace else that was prepared for business. These people weren t even busy  I was met with incredulity and the manager literally made a sarcastic comment which amounted to me being ridiculous after waiting 10 minutes for two bean and egg tacos  which they got wrong and laughed about when they reread the ticket  and then tacking on 30 minutes for a task that should have been done the night before. Yep  it takes a lot to anger me  but when an establishment attempts to make customers feel unreasonable or responsible for their ineptitude  that s when I let it fly. It s plain for any one who comes into this place to see how badly run it is. There is zero excuse. Every other fast food place has training and rules for its franchisees so one bad apple doesn t ruin it for everyone. I m starting become super curious as to how TC is run because this place is a blight on the whole brand. This chick today though took the cake  telling me I must be in a bad mood and that she hopes god gives me what I deserve. Yep  I said a few choice words including that this place needs to get its   it together and that EVERYONE in the place agrees. I know because the six other customers who were dining in and I struck up a conversation at the empty salsa bar and all of them said they don t know why they keep coming here it s so bad. A couple who came in after me walked out upon hearing the ruckus between the manager and I. They asked me what happened and they said they were going somewhere else because it s all too common to get really bad service here. We met up in the line at another TC a few miles away. It looks like TC is reading the reviews and I think it s telling that this behavior continues. Either they can t afford to hire and retain decent staff or they don t give a damn.
Taco Cabana,73,This place is unfortunately gone downhill from a previous level of  fair if you have no other choice . The staff appears to not want to be there  and it takes forever for their lackluster food. I used to love TC and it was my go to for cheaper but higher quality fast food Mexican. I m not sure what has happened  but it s now downright terrible and no one seems to care. Their quesadillas have a scant trace of meat covering maybe 1 3 of a dry cracked tortilla. I have given them a few more tries than I should have  but I will not be returning. I m not sure how they are still in business with these reviews 
Taco Cabana,74,After a rough day  I took my son to TC as it s his favorite restaurant. I never write reviews  but the service I received was exceptional  especially from Michael  Fast  courteous  and correct  served with a smile and encouragement that literally turned my entire day around  Our new favorite TC 
Taco Cabana,75,This place is a fucking shit show of a company. I will be driving 5 minutes past this to the other location close to me.
Taco Cabana,76,Best value on fast food Tex mex.  Fresh tortillas    Nephew ordered shredded chicken off the menu.  Peach empanadas are small and tasty.
Taco Cabana,77,If I could I would give this location 0 stars... on Tuesday they had no running water and now today they have store bought tortillas.  What the heck is going on 
Taco Cabana,78,Even though we had an issue which had nothing to do with taco cabana  the manager Sarah handled everything the way a good manager should. Our experience there was really good even though we were short a little money. She was professional about everything and handled the situation as best as she could. She made us feel like good customers even though it was our fault. Big props to a manager like her and hope taco cabana can keep more people like her around  Will definitely be going back here even though it s a little far for us but would rather go there because we feel welcomed there 
Taco Cabana,79,Don t know what the deal is with this place. But the wait is always very long  things are missing from your order if you don t check  and some salsas are never available or run out very quickly all the time. I ve come back multiple time hoping for a change but it s the same every time. Not sure if they are just short handed or if its bad management. Food is still decent but not presented well which I wouldn t really expect anyway.
Taco Cabana,80,I don t expect much for quick Tex-mex  but I expect them to at least get the order right. First they forgot my chicken enchilada plate. After I told them  they moved to correct it  but when I got home it was a cheese enchilada plate. Lame. Don t recommend this location.
Taco Cabana,81,I love their food. This particular location  however  seems completely incapable of taking your drive-thru order at the speaker in under 5-8 minutes  and then take another 500 hours to fill the order once you re at the window. I usually end up leaving the drive-thru line once I ve waited for 10 minutes or so- usually behind only 1 car. Not very convenient 
Taco Cabana,82,Going to this TC location is a gamble. Sometimes they get the order right  but most of the time they don t. I m not sure if they are passive aggressive  but my chicken fajita taco came with laughable crumbles of chicken  and my husbands black bean taco came with watery black beans without lettuce and tomatoes.  We ve received poor portions of food from this location before too. Once when I called their phone number  the operator said the number is no longer in service. So I had to drive back to get a taco they forgot  and the man asked me if I was lying. I showed him the receipt to show I was indeed not lying. Are these employees happy 
Taco Cabana,83,The drive thru was not working.  2 Tacos took over 15 minutes.  They don t serve breakfast tacos all-day - although their menu offers  all-day breakfast tacos.  While staff was friendly... location clearly needs better management.
Taco Cabana,84,Why do I keep coming back here    Went for lunch 2 days ago and was ignored while trying to order lunch.  Manager ignored us as he prepared drive in customers.
Taco Cabana,85,NEVER GOING BACK    SALMONELLA  After 6 days of gut wrenching diarrhea and vomiting I will never go back to this place.    NOTE  this is the only meal that I had in the previous 4 days that wasnt eaten at home and wasnt apart of my entire family eating with me.  It is unfeasible that I contracted Salmonella anywhere else.  And this is the only thing I had to eat on Saturday morning.  I ordered 2 bean and cheese tacos and one egg and chorizo taco last Saturday morning around 7am.  The bean and cheese tacos tasted fine.  When I tried the egg and chorizo one it had no flavor.  I should have known to stop right then and there.  I get the egg and chorizo taco there often and I had one the previous Saturday and this one tasted  unright .  About 6 hours later  I vomited in my bathroom sink because I could not make it to the toilet fast enough and I had 103 degree fever.  For the next 6 days  nothing but agonizing stomach cramps and diarrhea.  Nine days later I still have diarrhea from the rotten food they served me.   The SLOW service is one thing BUT being poisoned should be unlawful.
Taco Cabana,86,Went to this location this morning for breakfast tacos.  I was paying by credit card.  For some reason  the credit card machine was malfunctioning.  I told the drive-thru employee  no problem I have cash. She said no...that it was really messed up and not to worry about it and sent me on my merry way with the promise of a good review.  Well here it is..made my day  thank you Taco Cabana..and the tacos were delish to boot   .
Taco Cabana,87,Slowest cabana there is in Austin and that s hard to do. Been three times at lunch time. No more than 2 people working in the kitchen always so it takes forever. There are more people in here waiting for their food than actually eating. Plus you lose your apatite when you see cooks picking items up off the floor and touching the trash can then go right back to making tacos without washing her hands. Don t come here.
Taco Cabana,88,The service here is horrible. They don t take people s time into consideration and are back there talking and not working took 4 minutes to finally get someone to come to take our order. Never called out numbers for letting us know when our order was ready and when you go to ask they still don t know who s order is who. Another order with in our party was never made and when we asked for a refund the manager gave a lot of attitude. I have never had an experience this bad at a taco cabana in my life. I am highly disappointed. Please check management and staff.
Taco Cabana,89,It s really gone downhill.  All the salsa items are empty.  Ask to refill and all the workers just keep passing it off to someone else.  Been sitting here going on 15 minutes waiting for an order for 4 people.  Probably my last visit.  It used to be a regular place.
Taco Cabana,90,Pleasantly surprised  I was concerned reading the reviews that the food might not be very good but my egg and bacon breakfast taco was tasty.  The service at the drive thru was OK and they were slower than most fast food places but not terrible.
Taco Cabana,91,I don t know how this location stays in business. About every 6 months  I decide to give them another chance. The food is good  but not good enough to wait OVER 30 MINUTES each and every time. I tried ordering online this time  hoping that my order might take some kind of priority. Nope. The estimate was 20 minutes  ridiculous for a fast food place  and it ended up being almost 40. The online order page gave me the option to request salsa  limes  etc.  which I did. But none were included. The employees just don t care. It has consistently been this way for over 5 years.
Taco Cabana,92,Truly awful.  Waited for a couple minutes at the drive through  nobody would talk to me.  Went inside to order.  Place stinks like a dirty bar. Waited 20 min for flauta plate to go.  Place was not busy.  Could not find napkins.  Bottom of the plate was greasy.  Food terrible.  Employees obviously not happy.
Taco Cabana,93,Worse taco cabana I ve been to. 3rd time they totally messed up my order. How hard is it  3 potatoe and egg tacos no tortillas   And took 10 minutes for them to bring me 3 tacos on tortillas...
Taco Cabana,94,Walked in on Saturday at 12 50 PM.  There was a frustrated customer ahead of us at the checkout stating she d been there 10 minutes without being waited on  we should have left there .  I called for someone in the food prep area to come out and take our orders.  We got our drink and sat down.  15 minutes later  people are queuing up to see about getting the food they ordered.  People were moving around in the kitchen but virtually no food was coming out.  Not sure what the problem was but we were in a hurry and left without food and without demanding a refund  it simply would have taken too long.  Avoid this place if it is at a normal meal time  way to unorganized and slow.
Taco Cabana,95,What can I say  It s a Taco Cabana. I find it about average. The staff is usually pretty responsive although it s still a 50-50 toss-up whether or not I get my Cabana Bowl correct  hold the rice  I said  . That being said  they are usually prompt and definitely better than some other locations I ve been to.
Taco Cabana,96,This is the slowest service I ever experienced  and based off other reviews that is not uncommon. It took 40 minutes for two breakfast burritos. I will never return  they need to hire more staff.
Taco Cabana,97,This taco cabana is the worst. I ve been coming to taco cabana since I was little... This one is below standards. It really upsets me that I can t get a breakfast taco without having to wait 15 minutes in the drive through when there isn t a long line. I just waited in line for 17 minutes for taquitos and tortillas. When the tortillas aren t fresh and no one was in line. Really disappointed.
Taco Cabana,98,I love how they say they are open until 1 00 am but the doors are locked at 11 00pm. Lovely. Thank goodness Whataburger is next door.
Taco Cabana,99,This Taco Cabana has the slowest service. I have come back a few times to give them a second chance  but the service continues to be poor. I have even called in my orders ahead of time  and you still have to wait for at least 15 min for the order. Time to find a another place.
Taco Cabana,100,A few years back we visited the Taco Cabana on 183 near 360 and had a great meal. The manager greeted us upon arrival  clearly explained the menu  offered suggestions to my parents  took our order and the food was very good. My parents  both first time customers  raved about how good it was for a fast food restaurant.   Ultimately  It was such a good experience that my father and I invested in Fiesta Restaurants and have made a handsome profit as their stock has steadily risen. I ve even checked up on their Pollo Tropical brand while on a trip in Florida.  Unfortunately  that visit with my parents was the last good experience I ve had at Taco Cabana. Since then the experiences have been largely awful and I don t understand why their stock has risen so much when their restaurant operations are by and large awful.  - The food overall is okay for fast Mexican food  but inconsistent and that in itself is a problem.  - Cleanliness is an issue in many of their stores  a few are run down and disgusting.  - The menu boards are almost impossible to read because of the confusing layout and a typeface that is way too small for the distance separating you and where they are posted.  - However  the biggest problem with Taco Cabana are the employees. A few are great  but the majority are awful   My recent experience on November 2 at this store on Mopac was the worst. We arrive at the store and standing to take our order is Casey. Normally employees remain nameless in my reviews  but she should be fired   She never greets us. She doesn t acknowledge our presence. She doesn t look us in the eye when we speak to her. She really doesn t answer the few questions my father asked about the menu and even worse the few things she does say are unintelligible since she doesn t speak up. I couldn t even hear her and I m 30 years younger.  Furthermore  she is representing Taco Cabana and her appearance needs improvement. She wore her uniform and hair in a way that makes her look like she could double as a homeless person.  So was she a brainless employee who detests her job and wants everyone to know that she hates it or was she on drugs  I guess I ll never know  but Taco Cabana this is who you ve chosen to represent your business before your customers and it s a poor choice   The rest of the experience sucked as much as the ordering process. The television on the wall was too loud and showing some noon time garbage that only brainless individuals watch. We couldn t hold a conversation over the noise.  The food was average for a Taco Cabana. Not the best I ve tasted  but not the worst.  The only bright spot in this visit is the fact that this particular store is newer  cleaner and gives a better impression than some of your other locations  hint- avoid the nastiness of S. Lamar at Riverside Drive .  Come on Taco Cabana  Get your act together  My parents and I used to be fans  but frankly you ve lost that distinction because you ve just let us down repeatedly since their first visit three years ago 
Taco Cabana,101,Hey guys. There was one time i went to a taco cabana and they literally got everything wrong. This was that location. Asked for a burrito with no beans.... Got beans no rice... Asked for a ground beef taco plate and my girlfriend got chk.asked for a queso got half the normal amount. Check your orders folks   only time ive been screwed over at t cab is this one location
Taco Cabana,102,So slow.  Computers are always down. Not enough workers in the morning. Food tastes horrible and the tea is always has a funny taste. This is Texas  you cany sell bad tea  Y all are from here. I ve only been at this location twice. Never again.
Taco Cabana,103,Sloooooooooow. Staff doesn t take things seriously here. Poor customer service.  Worst of the bunch. Poorly run location because it s consistently bad. Love the food though when it s right.
Taco Cabana,104,We ordered ahead and went to pick it up. We should ve checked before driving away  but they got our order very wrong. So we went back to have it corrected  handed it to what looked like the manager  and didn t get so much as an acknowledgement  much less an apology. He just gave us what we were missing and dismissed us. Thanks TC.
Taco Cabana,105,I had been a fan of tc back to the small outside patio only restaurant in San Antonio on hildebrand .. This place has gone from bad to worse and I honestly can t believe it s still open . Food and service were terrible. The hot sauce bar was sitting on a side table not on the ice and staff was digging out of the bins  not even sure how long it was not cooled.  Food was terrible and the dining room disgusting. The cashier was on a cell phone making orders handling food without gloves. Yuck. Even though there were 4 parties in the dining room  took them 20 minutes to get our order and it wasn t even complete while we watched them standing around yapping. Will NEVER go back and I will most likely be calling the health department   I added a star only because it wouldn t let me post without one .. I would say NO in fact negative stars
Taco Cabana,106,Chicken fajita meat dry  hard and gross. Nearly could not chew chicken. I think it had either been sitting out all morning or all night. VERY bad. Complaining to corporate site.
Taco Cabana,107,Ridiculous wait times for 2 tacos with half empty dining room. 18 minutes so far......
Taco Cabana,108,Good food.  Good value.  Service a little slow. I have been back several times with similar experience each time
Taco Cabana,109,Sad.  Just sad.  I ve been a TC fan for as long as they ve been in Austin - knew they were a mere shadow of their former self.  But had no idea how far they had fallen.  Had no idea that there is basically no  plates  anymore - just an enchilada plate  and even that was only beef or cheese - the green chicken ones are gone.  OK - wet  cold night I had my heart set in Mexican comfort food  so went for the cheese.  Holy cow  I had no idea how wretched a dinner could be.  The  gravy  was some flour thickened brown sauce without a trace of chili powder.  The always excellent made on the premises flour tortillas were awful - wafer thin on one end  1 8  thick on the other.  Someone wrapped those in foil to serve - someone felt they were wrong  and sent them out anyway.  The Stehling family are weeping over what their baby has become.
Taco Cabana,110,I really hate to be one to write a bad review  but I can t not write one in this case.  We went to Taco Cabana this evening to dine-in  and we walked up to the register to order  and there was a man at the register who did not acknowledge us at all. Come to find out he doesn t work there  he was just repairing the computers at the register. Ok  sure. Makes sense. But  at least 4 Taco Cabana employees noticed us standing there waiting to order  but said nothing to us. Not even a  We ll be right with you   or anything. Even the manager came out of the kitchen and looked right at my husband and I and didn t say a word. We were completely ignored  We waited for almost 5 minutes to order  and nothing. Not a word from any employee. So  we just walked out and headed over to Whataburger. Even if they were closed-which they weren t- they could ve at least told us so.  I doubt Taco Cabana corporate will ever read this  but judging from the other poor reviews about this location  I would hope they find brand new management.
Taco Cabana,111,Took almost 25 minutes to get my food when the store was basically empty. Also after entering the building it was nearly 5-10 mins before I was even greeted at the register and able to order my food.
Taco Cabana,112,I have received the incorrect order 2 times at the drive thru and the last time my coffee  hot  was almost ice cold.  I have filled out the survey at  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.cabanacares.com amp s 7b084812caa3042b57055a1a0222b9b068b88f5a1f501f2bb2d168c1428168f3  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  cabanacares.com  a  2 times and have never been contacted.   One time I went 5 min before breakfast and they would not serve me breakfast tacos.  I waited 30 min asked the cashier about my food they gave it to the only patrons in the restaurant.  When I finally did receive my food the order was wrong I was charged the full amount and asked to swap out for breakfast taco s and correct the order. I was denied and just wanted to leave at that point.    I do not recommend this location. I only go cause my wife eats the corn tortillas since she is gluten free and they always give flour or add an ingredient we cant eat. I am very clear when I make my order I even repeat myself.
Taco Cabana,113,Apparently NOT a 24 hour location and the employee was very rude at letting me know this.
Taco Cabana,114,If I could pick one place to blow up this would be it  DISGUSTING  The worst food i have ever ate in my whole life...don t waste your time and money. I would rather eat some vomit off the side of the road....  The breakfast tacos are good  P
Taco Cabana,115,Love the food  but the last 3 times I ve come  my order has been messed up. I thought the 3rd time would be a charm  but I was let down.
Taco Cabana,116,The night crew went from excellent up until recently. Our past 3 orders have been severely wrong. We are not rude people and it really irks me when we are not treated with the same respect we show. The dt is extremely rude. The guy at the register is rude as well. This is my 3rd complaint and still no reply. I am posting this letter on your Facebook page  Yelp  and any other social platform willing to listen. Unfortunately I cannot provide you with my ticket number because my husband took it with him to prove to your incompetent staff that they got our order wrong  AGAIN  This location used to be great  it has seriously gone downhill and this form is a joke because I have yet to hear a reply.  -Disgruntled Ex-Customer
Taco Cabana,117,There s almost nothing more comfortable than some of my late Saturday nights when I first moved to Austin.  I remember the sheer blasts I used to have finding a good movie  cranking the 750 watt Sony home theater system and getting on the Internet to find the next  get rich quick  scam.  Anything and everything from buying real estate foreclosures to selling the greatest vitamin in the world. Then cracking the 4Th beer on an hour old case of Bud Light tall boys and realizing that it s almost 2am and I m freaking starving.  There s Taco Bell with their mystery beans and the two stop light tango or Taco C one exit down off Mopac with real chickens on the twelve chicken rotisserie and only one stop light  thus mathematically  decreasing my chances of a deewee in half.  You could bank on my order of the Super Tex-Mex Special every time.  Oh to waking up the next morning with a slight hangover and momentarily wondering what irresponsible risk you took the night before  then seeing that crumpled pink and white paper bag under the coffee table and thinking to yourself  I m not in jail and I didn t open myself up to the gift that keeps on giving.   As for the slight guilty conscious  I ll run it off in an hour.  All in all it s only a 9 on the list of  the top 10 bad choices I could have made that night... Taco Bell would have been 6 and picking up a stripper at Expose number 3.  You and I both don t want to think about 1 and 2...  Once again I m safe safe safe and three stars out of five ain t bad considering...
Taco Cabana,118,I have been a long time customer of TC but won t be visiting this location any time soon.  I was wary right from the start since the salsa bar looked like it had been unattended for quite a while  messy and cilantro looked like it had seen its day.  The upfront person to take in house orders was no where to be found and when they showed up minutes later after a kitchen employee getting off work noticed us and flagged someone- this girl was unapologetic and unenthusiastic to say the least.  She didn t give us options on anything on our plates and rang up the smallest drinks  not asking for a size.  Our food was poorly cooked and cold with the exception of the enchilada sauce we requested after we got our food - also there was no salad or guacamole on either of our plates which there should have been.  I m sorry to say there was more I could elaborate on but feel you get a taste of our experience- sadly I looked at their yelp rating afterward and not before or we probably wouldn t have had this sad dinner.
Taco Cabana,119,I came here on the weekend and I encountered a few minor problems during a simple dine-in experience   there was no ice and many of the tables were dirty. Also  Taco Cabana is not speedy in their food preparation. This has been my consistient experience with every location I ve visited.  The drive-through service has actually been more enjoyable and less frustrating than going in.  I ve had to wait a bit but usually on other customers placing long  complicated orders rather than the employees taking their time.
Taco Cabana,120,Haven t been to Taco Cabana for a while. I like their food  but after over 30 minutes in the drive thru  I remember why I never come. Under staffed  poorly managed.... a clear lack of corporate vision and oversight. It amazes me that a couple of blocks away Chic-fil-a can serve 200 cars in the time it took these folks to serve 5.
Taco Cabana,121,This used to be my absolutely favorite Cabana -- the company must agree  because they ve filmed two commercials there. When I first started coming here a couple years ago  the staff was unfailingly friendly  and while the place was usually pretty busy  they never seemed overwhelmed or unhappy.  So what on Earth happened  I ve been here for lunch more than once in the past few months  and I m greeted with a huge line in front of the single cashier. The salsa bar is messy  and the staffer who brought me my food slides it onto the table with a long-suffering look. If you re lucky  the cashier will even complain about how many customer she s served.  Look -- the food is  generally  great. Still  customer service is everything. I used to drive past three other Taco Cabanas just to come to this one because of the friendly staff and atmosphere. Now I d rather save the gas.
Taco Cabana,122,I have been eating at Taco Cabanas all over the state for almost my entire life. This is by far one of my favorite drive thru place. In my 20  years of frequenting this place I ve had the following negative experiences    -Repeatedly putting salsa in bag that leaks out of its containers onto the leather seats of my car.  -Encountering drive thru employees that have no clue how to speak English.  -Cold Food  -Leaving things out of my order  -Credit Card swiper at the window NEVER working   So why do I continue to eat at Taco C  I effin love the breakfast tacos  potato  egg and cheese to be exact. Yes  everyone in Austin likes a good breakfast taco for breakfast but I could eat Taco C breakfast tacos for Breakfast  Lunch  Dinner  Afternoon Snack and Midnight drunk food if they served them all day.   Last summer  I was heading to work one morning when I saw the most glorious sign hanging from the Taco C at Mopac and William Cannon. The sign read  Drive Thru Now Open 24 Hours.  My heart skipped a beat and it hit me that I would no longer have to eat crappy Jack in the Box tacos when I was drunk at 3am.   A couple of weeks later  I got my chance to have 3am breakfast tacos and it was oh so amazing. When I got to the window I told the manager how awesome it was that they were now open 24 hours and he thanked me by throwing in a couple of extra breakfast tacos    Overall this location by far has the best service of any Taco C I have ever been to. They are very consistent and I like that I see the same few people working there.   As long as they keep making me hot breakfast tacos I will be a repeat customer 
Taco Cabana,123,If you like to start your day with a little spice  the breakfast tacos here hit the spot   My boyfriend and I happened to wake up during their breakfast hours  for once   and so here we were about thirty minutes later.   I opted for the potato and egg tacos while he got the egg and cheese tacos. Topped off with their green hot sauce  these tacos will fill you up despite their diminutive size. The tortillas may be small  but they re very generous with the portions inside.   The potato and egg tacos had good-sized potato chunks wrapped in a delicious  warm blanket of soft egg. And if you really want to wake up and don t have caffeine around  pour the green hot sauce into the tortilla  wrap it up  and take a big bite. Your taste buds will swim around in spicy energy for a while.   So  yes  it s a Taco Cabana  but sometimes the simplest  or the not so popular  things in life can add flavor to your day.   
Taco Cabana,124,Just an FYI this place is NOTHING like the Taco Cabana on South Lamar  alot more clean  and fresh tasting food. That being said... It seems like everytime I come here  its bring your kids to work day. Kids running around and into the kitchen  the mom who apparently works here runs back there  grabs their kids  and watched as they continue to do it and she just gives up   The food salsa bar  is the only reason I return here  if your looking for friendly staff... As Johnny Depp once said  FORGET ABOUT IT   They could care less when you think of them  and seem to give you the stink eye everytime they give you your food. But if your looking for a semi quick place to grab some mexican food that isnt Taco Bell. Check this location AND ONLY THIS LOCATION out.
Taco Cabana,125,Cabana bowl was great.  It is my fav.  Beef  chicken. Or ground meat works.
Taco Cabana,126,It takes WAY to long to get your food. It is fast food not somewhere you should have to sit and wait for 20 minutes in the drive thru to get your food. They are always unfriendly and it is said because I use to love Taco Cabana...I will get take out at a mexican restaurant it takes less time.
Taco Cabana,127,The only thing I will order here is breakfast. Just too many better Mexican restaurants in Austin to eat here for lunch or dinner. And it s a convenient stop in the morning sometimes. The fajitas  skip the chicken  and eggs are ok but better when drenched in some of the salsa from the salsa bar. Salsa bar is definitely the highlight here with 4-5 types AND onions  cilantro and jalapenos. Potato and egg burrito is a nice large size too. Prices are very cheap. Something about the eggs though keeps it from getting four stars. They just seem really light. Are they fake  Are they egg-whites  Hmm . . . It s really hard to mess up eggs 
Taco Cabana,128,SO incredibly slow. Took 10 minutes to get the food then the staff got the order wrong and was rude when I politely told them that it was wrong. When I got the right amount of food  they put the wrong meat in the tacos. Will not be going back which is sad because Taco C is my favorite. Please please please hire people who somewhat give a dang about customer service just a little bit at least.
Taco Cabana,129,Yes  I m actually writing a review over Taco Cabana. This place is just ridiculous. Unfortunately  it s super close to my home  so if I ever want Taco C  this is the only one available. The employees take forever to answer the drive-thru  they take foreverrrr when actually taking the order   repeating it wrong - just general confusion   and they overwhelmingly get the order somewhat wrong. The one thing I can say is the person at the window is usually nice  albeit completely  out of it.  I wouldn t normally write a review over fast-food  I m not expecting 5 star restaurant service here  but this place is consistently horrible. Taco C s drive-thru service has become a joke among my friends and myself. It s laughable - but I do hope someone in higher management reads these reviews and either provides better training and or increases supervision.
Taco Cabana,130,This place is dirty. The service is horrible and when my food was delivered it was just tossed at my table. The drive thru is rarely open when they advertise it and the service is slow..... I will not return my business here 
Taco Cabana,131,Ok so this place is kind of slow. The drive-thru always seems backed up but I ve come to learn  if the restaurant is open  GO INSIDE  Why take the chance of getting a wrong order and wasting your gas while sucking in the exhaust fumes of the guy in front of you when you can just walk inside  It s usually much faster  you can double check your order and you can load up at the salsa bar all you want. We tried their carne guisada and it was downright delicious. Often times Taco Cabana over season their meats so sometimes it s crazy salty but the carne guisada was perfect  I would ve been happy with it at a sit down Mexican restaurant. TC got rid of their free chips which is kind of a bummer but overall Taco Cabana is great for a cheap fast meal. Especially if you use their coupons which makes it an even better deal.
Taco Cabana,132,OK it is a chain  it is fast food but when you need a pure Tex-Mex fix this is my go to place wherever in Texas I am.  I know the kitchen is spotless  and the salsa bar is made with fresh ingredients and is consistently good I had the enchillada plate and the only downside was the refried beans were not hot and needed a lot of doctoring.   Like all other chains  they go through a lot of employees pretty quickly.  Yesterday we were luck enough to have a really nice and friendly crew working.  They refreshed the Salsa bar and knew hwat they were doing. I wish they would open a store in St. Louis  if they did I know where I would be every week.  The tortillas are real  and made in one of the famous machinas that kids love to watch work. The food is hot  and tasty and I can make it as spicy as I wish.
Taco Cabana,133,Worst TC ever  One star is being gracious. I would rate this at a zero if I could. I don t know why I keep putting myself through it  but I swear its the last time I ever go back to this location. Its only a couple of blocks away from my house  so its convenient. That s about the only positive thing I can say about it. The WB next door is just as terrible.  Ever find a hair in your taco  then get accused of putting in there yourself  This is the place where that kind of magic happens.  Ever waited in line for 20 minutes for your steak fajita tacos  only to have the window guy tell you that they ran out of steak   That s right. They took my order in the drive through  and let me wait all the way to the window before telling me. Well  if you re coming to this location prepare yourself. Set the bar really low  and you ll still be disappointed.   Last time I was there  the girl at the window was too busy texting  or something  on her phone to even take my CC for payment. After a few minutes  she just closed the window and walked off.   Tonight I waited for 15 minutes for bean  amp  cheese tacos. I thought it would be an easy one for them  but nope  15 minutes later my cold beans come out.   BTW  if they ask you to pull forward so they can bring your tacos out  its just an excuse to keep you from watching them through the drive through window.  I ve tried to speak rationally with a day manager  but they couldn t care less about what you think. Full blown eye-rolls and all.   Save yourself the guaranteed disappointment and go to Torchy s or something.   I signed up with yelp just for this review. Should ve done it last year and saved someone else the trouble.  TL DR -Do Not Eat Here 
Taco Cabana,134,I love Taco Cabana   However  the one at Wm Cannon and Mopac is so consistently poor  it is the exception. They have the slowest workers of any Cabana I have seen.  BUT what they lack in speed  they make up in really bad attitudes.  I saw someone say the drive through is slow.  You should go inside.  It s normal for them to pretend the counter inside does not exist.  You have to find someone to take your order. TC may think the store is doing okay  but that is only because they have such a great location.  I have walked out of this one several times with other people who could not put up with the poor service.  I have seen large groups walk across the parking lot to the Whataburger in the morning.  This is not a one time event either. They have had terrible service  especially on the weekend  for over two years.
Taco Cabana,135,THE DRIVE THROUGH AT THIS LOCATION IS TERRIBLE.  I love TC and have gone here often. I feel safe in saying the drive through screws up our order 90  of the time.  No complaints about taste or staff s attitude  but the lack of attention to getting all the food in the bag is so pathetic that it makes every meal there a bad experience.  PATHETIC.
Taco Cabana,136,Worst management ever  A corporation s  what not to do  manual. This place really hurts the  15 hr minimum wage movement.
Taco Cabana,137,It would be nice to know who owns this Taco Cabana because this is the worse chain I have ever been to and I m a regular  They have to know  right  The drive-thru ALL THE TIME takes no less than 15-25 minutes  they always get the orders wrong  the staff is rude  they don t care to be there. And the food is always stale  Can the owners fix this problem please  You are in a great location   
Taco Cabana,138,For some reason they can t get a simple taco order right.  After several morning visits  giving the benefit of the doubt   my orders were always wrong   I m done giving my money to any location.
Taco Cabana,139,If I could give this location a negative star I would. This place is employed by slow folks. I can get there and be the only car in the drive thru on a Wednesday morning at 6 30am and it stills takes me 15 minutes to get my food. I even walked in 1 morning to be helped and 3 people walked by. Not a single one looked at me or say  I ll be with you in a minute . I waited for 10 minutes just standing next to their line and still no service  so I left  empty handed and hungry. When I want breakfast tacos tacos I think of TC. But this location is always God awfully slow. I can honestly say I would much rather drive to the TC on 290 and be helped there instead of this convenient location next to my work. Too many times has it taken a ridiculous amount of time to get thru the line. I will never been going here again      Get your act together and maybe I ll give you a try again in years to come. For now  I d avoid this place 
Taco Cabana,140,I don t feel this place is very clean  I have had 2 experiences. One with a hair on my food and another with a piece of glass. They need to be very careful.
Taco Cabana,141,the rudest employees ever. stale chips every time. call to complain and no one ever fixes the situation.
Taco Cabana,142,After last night s experience  I have to be done with this chain. The service is slow  staff rude and careless and food quality far lower than mediocre. I spent 34-40 minutes in the drive thru that wasn t even that busy last night. I don t mind waiting all that much if the staff is nice at the window and I get what I ordered  but unfortunately they barely spoke a word to me and acted inconvenienced that I was in their drive thru. I got back home with no tortillas for my fajitas  should be pretty standard right    and all of the food was turned over and spilled  leaking in the bag. It is frustrating  but I guess I should have learned my lesson from them by now. Bye taco c.
Taco Cabana,143,Why can t they ever get an order right   I go  periodically - I call it the triumph of hope over reason - and they never fail to disappoint.  Tonight I ordered barracho beans and got refried.  Not the end of the world  but it s nearly every time the order is messed up.  If you go  don t wait until you get home to check your order.  You may not have the mediocre food you ordered.
Taco Cabana,144,Never ever leave with out checking your order they got it wrong 3 of the last 4 times. That s crazy 3 out of 4 times wrong       Get it together people      The only reason I go here is that my kids love it but I think they see the light they can never get it right   Service is better
Taco Cabana,145,Slow service  bland breakfast tacos  and a staff that makes you feel like they would rather be anywhere else but there. Waited 20 minutes for three breakfast tacos on 9 4. The cashier didn t say two words to me and made me feel like I was inconveniencing her. Not going back
Taco Cabana,146,This location is awful  They are sooooo slow and almost always screw up your order. I will be avoiding this Taco cabana from now on  Horrible 
Taco Cabana,147,I stopped in to order a late night snack and ordered a cheese quesadilla and chicken flautas. When I pulled up to the drive through window I observed the cook placing loads of cheese on my quesadilla with his bare hands. I guess when his coworker saw me looking in disgust he said something. At that time he hurriedly put on gloves. I drove off. I will not be back.
Taco Cabana,148,I recently went to Taco Cabana with my boyfriend. The women in the drive through greeted us with a cheery  welcome to taco cabana  would you like to try one of our taco combos today   when I replied that I wasn t ready  she instantly became a different individual  very rude and short with me. I placed my simple order  large chicken fajita nachos and the shrimp taco combo with no lettuce or tomatoes. When I got home  I realized that my chips and queso had not been included with my order. This is not the first time little details of my order have been forgotten by this taco cabana. Constantly little portions of my order are forgotten. I called the Guest Services Line and it put me through to Popeye s customer service line. What kind of joke is taco cabana trying to pull  When I got back to the store to pick up my chips and queso  I decided to have a conversation with the manager. There was apparently no manager so I spoke with the shift supervisor. The entire time I was talking to him  he sat there counting the money. The first thing you learn in customer service training is to listen to the customer when they have an issue. What he told me by not looking me in the eyes while I was complaining is that my concerns weren t important enough to him. So I finish my concern and I go home. Finally I can dig in to my meal. Nope. THERE WAS A HAIR IN MY FOOD  After all that and I find a nasty long black hair in my food. That is disgusting.  Taco cabana has pretty delicious food  but this location totally sucks. They are slow  rude and obviously have subpar hygiene.
Taco Cabana,149,I ll admit it  I like Taco Cabana for a quick lunch or midnight munchy. Thank goodness there are more Taco Cabanas around because I m pretty done with this one. They ve gotten my last three orders wrong. Is it just me and my orders  I don t know  but getting only a knife and a spoon with my salad  that I discovered was literally only lettuce and meat  no other toppings  wtf   put the last dingleberry on the on the shit sunday.
Taco Cabana,150,You ve gotta admit  for fast food Taco Cabana is good. I m not saying there aren t a hundred other places to get a much better taco out there  but it all comes down to cost  proximity  and well  laziness. We go here about once a week when we re too tired from work to cook or go out. He loves the quesadillas  i go for the barbacoa  chicken fajita  and bean and cheese tacos. True  not the best  but certainly not the worst. And the fresh tortillas really seal the deal
Taco Cabana,151,This is a newer taco cabanas around but don t let the shiny facade fool you.  Its still just like every other taco cabana in town with long waits late at night  and shoddy service when you need it most.  One night I was served drinks without tops and they said they ran out.  I m like what the hell am I supposed to do with 3 drinks like this   They are forgetful but the cabana bowls are good so I have a hard time passing it up after a long night out.  This sure beats Taco Bell down the road but remember we are still talking about fast food.  Its always a good alternative when the Whataburger next door is full.
Taco Cabana,152,Brought in breakfast tacos for the office this morning  and they were pretty much scooped up a lot faster than yesterday s tacos from Jason s. I can see why  good portioning  fresh salsa and pico to top them off with  good variety. It s taco cabana  so don t go there for a date. However  it s a really satisfying stop off for those breakfast hankerings.
Taco Cabana,153,I think this is one of the nicer Taco Cabanas in the area  I m not sure how long it has been open  maybe a year or so  However the service is sloooow  like all other locations. I went here to pick up breakfast this morning  and the tacos were just fine. Not as good as Maria s or Torchy s  but considering I was in a hurry this was just fine.
Taco Cabana,154,Never will stop here again. Their customer service has proven to me SEVERAL times they dont have the customer in mind  SLOW SLOW SLOW ... and No one at the cash register  This is restaurant management CRIME  The last three times I stopped in  there was either no one at the register taking care of customers  or off to the side with no sense of urgency at the LONG LINE of waiting and irrate customers. I will take my business elsewhere.
Taco Cabana,155,We go here twice a week for breakfast because my 3 yr old loves the bacon   egg tacos.  The service is fast and food is not bad.  Typical for a chain restaurant  but what got me bothered was when the cashier came to take our order  and give us change without taking off her gloves.  Then she goes back and uses the same set of gloves to put the dough in the tortilla flattening machine.  Gross  That is like a major sin in the food service business.   Needless to say we made a comment to the manager but did not stick around to see what happened.
Taco Cabana,156,Let me just start by saying I am putting more effort in this review than any of the members of this staff did in prepping our meal and taking care of the six customers waiting at the drive thru.  To kick things off  we had to repeat our order multiple times for to cashier to only forget half the order. Note that this is understandable fast food industry can get loud and busy. However  in the end our order was a cheese quesadilla and a coke missing all the other pieces of the puzzle. With one car in front of us we waited for a good ten to fifteen minutes. Once it was our time to pay we did so and proceeded to wait further. While waiting we grew impatient once we saw our order was ready however the same cashier decided that we should wait longer as she played with her phone likely tweeting how difficult her job was.  Best part of the wait. As we watched with patience lost we noticed one of the food prep staff proceeding to dig in to her right nostril in order to adjust her piercing. No joke. She then continued to prep food without any change of gloves. We are talking full hand into produce and into someones tacos. By the time precious decided to give us our food we handed the order back and requested a refund. With that she blew her attitude and walked away as did the food prep staff.... I have never considered throwing my order at someone until this moment. Though I chose not to as it wasn t worth the trouble. I wont go with out saying that yes I lost my cool and piped off at the staff as we left. However this location is not worth your time nor money.   I wouldn t write the poor review if this was the first occurrence. However last time we visited this location the staff reported that their was an hour wait for food... Suppose we should have called ahead to make reservations.
Taco Cabana,157,I don t really know why I eat breakfast here on occasion.  Today was probably the worst I ve had and most days the food isn t very good anyway.  Their prices are beginning to spiral and a small soft drink is about  1.50.  My meal was served with one cheese enchilada  if you can call it that.  It was so overcooked or better yet  had been in the bin so long it could not be pierced with a fork.  For the first time I complained to the manager and she agreed it should never have been served - much less eaten.  Blah   Most of the time the music in this place is blaring.  You can t think to read.  Take a PASS on Taco Cabana and all their establishments.
Taco Cabana,158,This is the only location I ve tried  but it was a terrible enough experience to keep me away from any other. The employees acted like they didn t want to be there and it was painful for them to elaborate on a single menu item. The brisket taco consisted only of a spoonful of wet brisket  and the nachos were stale.
Taco Cabana,159,kids said lets go to Taco Cabana so we did they got it wrong again     I ll never go again 
Taco Cabana,160,Always reliable in the middle of the night when a taco is needed   But Capri was an amazing addition to the awesome drive thru experience after a late night of fun   Will definitely be going back... and not just for the Taco Box this time  
Taco Cabana,161,To me  not the real deal in Mexican food  but get s the job done when you re hungry. It wasn t crowded when I went in  so that was a plus that my order would be up quick. I ordered the Brisket Taco plate  which was delicious  and a margarita. To be frozen  and not a place you d think it would be tasty  boy was I wrong  it was damn good. Overall  Taco Cabana is a place you should try out.
Taco Cabana,162,Didn t give me my large quesadilla on a 4 person order  they fail at life.
Taco Cabana,163,DISGUSTING. I ordered 3 street tacos around 3pm on a Thursday. there were only 2 or 3 people inside and nobody in the drive through. not busy at all. pulling through the drive through and paid for my tacos  total was around  5 so I gave the cashier  6 and he closed the drawer before getting my change. which wasn t a big deal he corrected his mistake and opened up the drawer again to give me my change which was 3 quarters and some nickels and pennies. he brings me the bag of food without saying a word. no  thank you ma am  no  have a nice day . just hands me the bag and closes the window. I get home to eat the tacos and what I find are 3 corn tortillas with what looked like cat vomit and onions inside. they were over spiced and DRIPPING with grease. the foil inside of the styrofoam box was coated on the bottom with a pool of grease. disgusting. the photo said they came with cilantro and feta cheese but all I got was meat mush and onions on some corn tortillas. I ve never had this problem at ANY other taco cabana...disrespectful to Mexican culture
Taco Cabana,164,I stopped for breakfast tacos before work this morning.  My order was very simple  two potato  egg and cheese tacos. The drive thru girl was completely rude.  I don t expect too much pep at that hour  but when someone says thank you the very least she can do is muster up a fake smile.  She looked away all dismissive and shut the drive thru door.  That alone will keep me from going back.  Oh yeah  and my order was wrong.  Amazing they couldn t handle putting 3 ingredients in a tortilla.  Who does the hiring over there   Get a clue  the reviews for this particular Taco Cabana are really bad     You really have service issues.
Taco Cabana,165,This Taco Cabana is in my neighborhood  and I used to frequent this establishment for breakfast tacos when it was first opened  however they NEVER have gotten my order correct even after going back to fix the problem. Everything is carelessly slapped together in haste. I am a vegetarian and even if I specify no meat in my potato  egg  and cheese taco which shouldn t contain meat normally I open my taco and find either bacon or brisket mixed in with my eggs rendering it inedible for me. I advise you to check your order extremely throughly before you leave or eat your food.
Taco Cabana,166,Although  I usually love Taco Cabana I really dislike this location  They are rude  forget items in your order and then roll their eyes at you. Don t even think about going through the drive thru.....you will wait an eternity and then they will treat you like dirt. There isn t another one near my house  so I just haven t been back after trying this one about 5 times. What a shame.
Taco Cabana,167,Shittiest group of employees I have encountered. They all looked like unhappy teenagers with horrible attitudes. No greeting was given as we entered. Waited at least 3 min before someone came to the register and food was delivered to the table with stone cold faces. I don t have any idea who was in charge but service sucks here and we will not return.
Taco Cabana,168,About once a month my wife and I want a cheap Tex-mex fix so we come thru the drive thru and order two Cabana Samplers subbing borracho beans for refried. 30  of the time they screw that up. Tonight was no exception. In addition to the wrong beans  They asked me if I wanted hot sauce. I replied yes  but none was found when I arrived home. My wife had no guacamole in hers  I had a tiny bit in mine. Shame I can t give them 0 stars. By the way  it was after dark and the menu board at the mic had no lights on. Where s the pride 
Taco Cabana,169,I was very disappointed when I called this location the day before to set an order for the following morning  24 tacos for a meeting  and arriving they had not received the order  the person on the line never passed along the info.     I had to wait 30 minutes for my order to be completed causing me to be late for work   Unacceptable  
Taco Cabana,170,That s it. I m done with this place  this morning was the last straw. I usually just get chorizo tacos  which are always dripping with grease and water. They re alright. But they aren t the only thing on the menu  and occasionally I ll try to get something different.   If you order something besides tacos  be prepared to wait. Forever.   The first time  I tried getting barbacoa tacos  and they didn t tell me that it was going to take them 20 something minutes since they didn t actually have any ready  and was really late getting back to work because of it. This was after being open for a couple of hours. Today  I ordered the fajitas and eggs. No fajitas  they didn t have those either  and that would have taken another 15-20 minutes. That s the whole reason I went there in the first place  knowing I could get some sort of real food. So I was thrown totally off guard  and got the huevos rancheros instead. That was still okay with me I guess  even though not at all what I wanted. Except they didn t have any ranchero sauce at the time either. But they didn t tell me this until they put the food out  under the heat lamps that they hadn t even turned on yet . So I was forced into eating something that I didn t want in the first place  and didn t want even more after that. You can get scrambled eggs and bacon anywhere. Granted  they had only been open for a good 20 minutes. But open they were  and on the menu it was. I worked fast food for a couple of years too  and I know that there is absolutely no excuse for not serving things that are on the menu. They usually take their sweet time getting to the cash register to take your order in the first place  thankfully the guy I talked today was helpful  or I would have lost it. The soda machine has been broken on more than one occasion  and the credit card reader at the drive through  never  works  I don t think it ever did. And they don t always clean their tables either  not that you should leave your trash there after you re done  that s what the trash cans are for in the first place  nasties .  Save yourself the trouble unless you don t have anywhere to be  or feel like calling ahead to see if they are actually serving the things they should be serving.
Taco Cabana,171,I have been going to TC for years.  Avoid this location if you can.  The Manchaca and William Cannon I35 locations are much better.  The staff has never been polite at this location and our order is not always correct.  This TC is in a nice area  but the service is not great.
Taco Cabana,172,For me  it would not be TC without an all mexican staff. There woman working the register was shockingly competent even asking me how I was doing. I have been here 10 times but I always get the personal chicken quesadilla. I don t know what people expect when they go here  but for me if I get what I ordered in a timely fashion I am happy. This place delivers that on the sit it. I dont know about the walk through.
Taco Cabana,173,I must say  that most Taco Cabana s have reasonable taste and value. But each taco cabana seems to be different. I tend to go here around lunch  90  of the time. If you go  get there before the lunch crowd. Anytime after that  they seem like they get behind on cleaning tables  refilling sauce bar  and brewed tea is sour or empty. However  I am giving this a low rating because quality. Last time I was there  I found a staple in my taco. Manager seemed to think it came from the cilantro. But that same moment  another customer from drive thru returned order because hard plastic object was found in burrito. I was refunded  but still... quality  cleanliness  and employee attitudes were minuses.
Taco Cabana,174,Went here at about 1am on a saturday night and the drive thru staff sucked horribly.  The woman who took our order sounded like she was on heroin.  When we told her we needed two seperate tickets she said that she couldn t do that because it was ACL weekend and they were too busy.  We were the only car there.  Really   Too busy    Interesting.  So we place our first order  two chicken quesadillas with pico  two bean and cheese tacos  and one bean burrito add onions.  Skimpiest crap I have ever seen.  There was barely any chicken or cheese and NO pico on the quesadillas and the beans were cold to lukewarm.  Then we had to go through again so we could place the second order.  There were really no problems the second time around   but in the time that it took to go through twice there was only one other car that pulled up.  Overall it was low quality service paired with low quality food.  I honestly wish we would have gone to Magnolia or Kerbey Lane instead.
Taco Cabana,175,Tried to just substitute corn tortillas for flour tortillas which come with the plate meal -- instead  got extra corn tortillas and was charged for them.  Tables for two or four were not wiped clean.  Went to patio just to search for a clean table.  Trash can outside overflowing with bees moving in.
Tacos Garcilita,1,Amazing food truck. It s located inside two tire and auto shop businesses. Limited menu but everything is good. I really enjoy the tortas.
Tacos Garcilita,2,All the stars for its high ratings are well earned.  This place is amazing.  Totally homemade.  Get the chicken quesadillas 
Tacos Garcilita,3,Don t blink  because if you do you might miss some of Austin s best authentic tacos  The woman inside is so sweet and makes everything to order. If you want something fresh  authentic  and one of a kind  then this is the place for you. I ordered a burrito and a Barbacoa taco. Ooooooh so good  The food came out hot and extremely flavorful. The price is right and this is a perfect option for those two might want some food on the go.
Tacos Garcilita,4,Some of the best tacos you ll find in Austin  If you re tired of baby tacos cuz you have to eat 10 to get full..you ll be happy here  They serve KING sized tacos that ll fill you up. Rosa is incredible. She will make you feel comfortable and happy because of her great food  and she has an awesome sense of humor  I m excited to try the rest of the menu  D
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,1,This place is incredible. Best Mexican food I ve had in Austin. They are also attached to a tortilleria - take home fresh pack salsas and guac  corn or flour tortillas  and cooked meat by the pound  or plate . They do catering and have meal deals.   Their tacos are bomb   
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,2,Food is ok  definitely better breakfast than lunch. I ve had it a few times enough to honestly say that it s very hit and miss. Double check your orders Because that has been my biggest issue with them. Food quality its actually on par for what you are paying  service is lackluster but not rude. It doesn t look super clean at first glance but that s just because of all the clutter no actual mess or smells. All in all worth trying though 
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,3,Filete a La Plancha is very good. You get 2 fish pieces with ensalada rusa  potato carrots peas in a rich creamy dressing  rice  tartar sauce  green salad and tortillas.
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,4,We tried the poblano shrimp  it was delicious and the micheladas were really flavored  good service
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,5,La verdad las muchachas que atienden son unas despotas siempre con su carota como si les fueras a pedir regalado    todos los dias voy a comprar tortillas y no es un paquete son varios para mi negocio  hay dias que regreso en la tarde a comprar mas y cada vez que  lo ven a uno ponen su carota y bien despotas contestan  ya van dias que segun no hay tortillas  ni un solo paquete segun ellas... mal servicio
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,6,Really enjoyed this place  Friendly service  Food really good flavor  Made fresh daily  Pricing excellent  Went three times while being out here in Texas
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,7,Salsa was AMAZING but unfortunately my food was cold.. super sweet staff though. I wanted to love them
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,8,This place is  delicious   I had the most legit caldo de res I ve ever had in a restaurant. Everything from the chips and salsas to the aguas frescas to the food tasted really authentic. This is also a tortilleria  so the corn tortillas are freshly made and awesome. So glad I found this place  and it s right in my neighborhood  Can t wait to try their other dishes.
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,9,Food is mediocre and service is horrible and don t get me started on the prices    Ridiculously over priced for the end result. Group of 4 and we all feel the same from the tacos to the seafood. We weren t the only table frustrated with the service either.....
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,10,Come here pretty often and I am never disappointed. The food is always delicious . The fresh corn tortillas are great. It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it.
Tortilleria El Taquito Marisquero,11,Legit tacos. Fresh  moist corn tortillas  didn t try the flour . Stuffed fairly well with fillings and double-wrapped. A couple were stuffed so full I divided them between the two tortillas. I ordered lengua  al pastor  cachete  and bistek. The bistek was the only one that wasn t top notch  a bit dry  but nicely seasoned and saut ed with jalape os and onions   otherwise I d give 5 stars. The standout is the salsa  hot and packed with flavor  both verde and roja . I give the al pastor high marks for being juicy and the cachete was the best. Got it delivered and now my whole house smells like fresh tortillas and seasoned meats. Yummy   
El Tacorrido,1,I ve been going here for about 2 years now and have no complaints  The restaurant is definitely a  hole in the wall  but I think that s the point and their tacos make it worth it. They make it in front of you  have great customer service  and their homemade tortillas are out of this world. The green sauce is hot and the perfect addition to any taco. 100  recommend this place.  If you want something  fancy  - then go down the street to Torchy s  but you won t find breakfast tacos that are even comparable there.
El Tacorrido,2,This place used to be my favorite al pastor in town and for my birthday this past March we had some friends over and my wife ordered 100 tacos. Nothing was labeled and tacos were crammed into boxes so to grab a taco you inevitably touched someone else s to find out what the hell kind of taco it was  just so dumb. They ve also always been SO tight with their salsas but the last two times we went put us over the edge. We went thru the drive thru and ordered 6 tacos. She asked what kind of salsa we wanted so i prefaced with  Ok 6 tacos  six salsas  so we d like three verde and three molcajete thanks   - Drove up and we were charged for two extra salsas. I asked why and the guy said  it s one for two  I said does that mean if i order one taco you don t get a salsa  He replied no  if you order one taco you get one salsa if you order two tacos you get one salsa. I asked how does that make any sense  What if its six people going their separate ways and want their own salsa  I got a blank stare. I m thinking this is a classic Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where he drives through the line 6 separate times in circles and orders one taco each time out of principle. On top of that we get home and WE ONLY HAVE 4 SALSAS FOR 6 TACOS OH THE HORROR. But seriously  charged extra and didn t even get what we paid for and the tacos are WAY smaller than they used to be. I wrote them privately and got no response so here is your public review El Tacorrido. You have lost our business over nickles and dimes and I will no longer recommend your fleecing ways. Adios 
El Tacorrido,3,I like it. Inexspensive tacos. They make it right in front of you. The menu is simple and the price is right. The host is nice but the building is older. Don t expect much. Eat good.
El Tacorrido,4,In an attempt to find some hidden gems  my boyfriend and I have been trying out some of the smaller and lesser-known taco joints in our area that serve breakfast.  I wanted to love El Tacorrido  because it s cheap and close to our house  but the whole experience was  blah.   First  this place won t make you a migas taco.  You can ask  and they will shake their heads and tell you they won t do it.  So then you order a taco with egg  cheese  tomato  onion  and.. well  that s it  because those are the options you have from the  extras  menu.  It s not like they don t have all of the ingredients to make a migas taco  they just won t let you pay for them to make it.  Okay  whatevs.  I ll eat my sad half-migas taco.   Note   I didn t ask for avocado  but there s no avocado listed on the  extra ingredients  either.  No avocado    Really     We ordered our tacos to go because the place smells... unpleasant.  It s probably a combo of cleaning agents and the giant vat of menudo they had going.  Whatever it was  it was not right.  No sir.  The tacos were small - I wish I had ordered three instead of two  and I never order three tacos  anywhere.  Tortillas were the standard store-bought variety.  Nothing special about what was inside.  I wouldn t call them the worst breakfast tacos I ve ever had  but they were pretty underwhelming.  To top it off  they put beans that my boyfriend didn t order on his taco.  To their credit  the green sauce is good.  There are just too many good breakfast taco joints near us to justify going back to this place.
El Tacorrido,5,This place is the real deal. Disregard Jena T s review  because first of all they don t even sell queso  and that s her primary complaint  that the queso was no good...   That being said  I m HIGHLY impressed with the quality of the food here. The Carnitas are worth killing over. And I m not talking about someone you don t know  I m talking about potentially murdering a family member if they get inbetween you and the savory slow-cooked pork shoulder.   The breakfast tacos are also extremely tasty. My daughters are the most picky people that I know  and they LOVE the tacos from El Tacorrido.   Most importantly  El Tacorrido has the best green sauce in the entire city. I m not just saying that  I ve lived in Austin for over 30 years and can t think of another place that has green sauce even remotely as good. If they stopped selling food today and solely stuck to selling salsa verde I firmly believe that they would be a multi-tiered international corporation with stock to rival that of Google by the end of the year.  The only reason they lose a rating star is because of their highly limited hours  which are listed in previous reviews. I can look past the strip-mall based location or the small dining area  but please  Tacorrido  give me more hours of the day to buy your delicious tacos.  I suggest you put El Tacorrido on your list of places to eat this weekend. You can thank me later.
El Tacorrido,6,Awesome little taco place. Everything is made from scratch right now in front of you.  It is located in a little run down shopping center next to a Bealls  didn t even know they were still in business  and a discoteca store.   The tacos are crazy cheap and crazy good. Breakfast tacos were less than  2.00 each and REALLY good. Pretty sure everything but the Mexican cokes were made from scratch.   What a great find 
El Tacorrido,7,If only they were open more  The green sauce is fantastic  the carnitas melt-in-your-mouth tender and super flavahlicious  their breakfast tacos generous - and when sauced up with any of the awesome homemade salsas - damn near irresistible.   But beware  they re only open on FRI  SAT  and SUN -- and then not for long. Only from morning til 2 PM. So get there quick.
El Tacorrido,8,Was suggested this place by a foodie friend.  Tacos are delicious and authentic.  Great prices for the quality of the food.  Carnitas and Al Pastor Lbs to go will have you stuffing your face.  Kind of a gem in hiding  hole in the wall dive-like location. As noted  this location is only open limited hours  but I find myself scheduling time to go when I get the urge for tacos.
El Tacorrido,9,I ve been to their take-out window several times since they opened and have always been impressed with the quality of the food.  The food s always fresh and hot  with a wait about three times as long as the Taco Bell drive-thru...  A very worthwhile delay.  Just took my 18-month-old son there last weekend and went inside for the first time  we enjoyed the the rodeo on TV and the a c  as well as the clean  plain interior.    My favorites are the chorizo y papas breakfast taco  with a generous addition of salsa   the chicken gorditas and the carnitas tacos.   The biggest drawback is the business hours   7a-2p every day.  I m glad they re open on Sundays but would love to grab dinner sometimes.
El Tacorrido,10,The location of this place is kinda sketchy and it s entrance is very nondescript. They have a pick up window outside  but you can also sit inside.   The decor is very plain even though it is very orange. you order at the counter and wait for your food to be ready which shouldn t take too long  however when my girlfriend and i went he thought that she ordered for both of us and i was left standing awkwardly for a long time. He apologized and it wasn t a big deal.  Their menu is filled with what i assume to be authentic sounding meats for tacos and gortas and the like. I got a carnitas taco and a chicken taco. They were both very delicious and only a  1.50 each. They also have aqua fresca and jarritos.   All said  good cheap tacos.
El Tacorrido,11,This taco place is clean  well decorated  and is a pleasant place to dine  The staff is courteous  also  Although the menu contains a  limited selection  the selection is delicious  The salsa and the tortillas are delicious  I particularly enjoy their selection of breakfast tacos. The restaurant is hidden away in an abysmal looking shopping center  but don t let that discourage you  The only setback  the reason that I rated it 4 stars  is it closes at 2pm.  Enjoy 
El Tacorrido,12,It s so nice to have a good place to get breakfast in our neighborhood.  The tacos are just as good as the popular Austin taco places  but you don t have to fight the crowds or wait forever to get your order.  There is also plenty of parking.  You can order outside at the window or venture inside and sit at a table.  If you decide to take your family  you should know they don t have high chairs.
El Tacorrido,13,dont believe the other reviewers. i was SUPER disappointed. queso was chunky  and im not talking about the onions  amp  veggies in it  -- the cheese part was chunky and there were big chunks of burnt cheese in it. i had the chicken taco  amp  the chicken was uber dry. never again. dont waste your money.
La Hawaiina,1,I ve been going here for years. Best burger I ve had and I l always sneak me one every month. They come loaded which is what I love personally they have a great Mexican twist to the normal American burger. Cash only but that s where it s best honestly. 10 10 recommend.
La Hawaiina,2,Amazing food  The sauces are off the chain. Comes out very quickly  Have only lived in Atx for 8 days. This is the 1st place we ve been to twice. Going to be a regular here for sure 
La Hawaiina,3,A friend and I stopped here after a Toadies concert at Emo s. It really hit the spot  The other food trucks had a line  but this one didn t  so we decided to try it out. We were glad we did  We didn t have to wait for long at all  and we both enjoyed our food. I had three sopes-one chicken  one pork  and one beef. They were super crunchy  savory  and the veggie toppings tasted fresh. My friend had three tacos. I think they were a mix of beef and chicken. They came with a red and a green hot sauce. Both were flavorful and spicy without lighting your face on fire. The guys running the operation were kind enough to offer us a couple of Cokes on the house  too. I thought that was nice of them   
La Hawaiina,4,I was waiting for my food and I saw the cook counting cash with gloves and preparing the food with the same gloves on. He did not change his gloves or washed his hands.
La Hawaiina,5,Despite the name  this is a Mexican food truck. I tried the bacon wrapped hot dog and it was legit  Definitely will come back for the tortas and gorditas  they looked great 
La Hawaiina,6,Awesome tacos   The meat was cooked just right. The tortillas didn t fall apart like most tortillas served at other food trucks. Overall  I was satisfied with the flavor and presentation of the food.
La Hawaiina,7,This hidden gem is easily one of the best Mexican joints in Austin. Come prepared with cash. It s well worth it 
El Pollo Rico,1,Best chicken I ve had in a long time. Ordered their half chicken and I knew I was in for a treat when the order was presented to me. Half chicken with a whole onion so sweet and flavorful you ll want to come back just for the onion   Chicken was properly seasoned and cooked well. I tried to get every little piece I could off of the meal. Came with beans and rice as well  they were both good  I will be recommending this place to my colleagues and family. Thank you for the great meal.
El Pollo Rico,2,When I went to this venue for a lite afternoon snack  little did I know that I would be appalled not only by its presentation but deliciousness was totally absent as well as some of the beef. I will continue to patronize El Pollo Rico to savor their chicken meals but will never again order a beef baked potato  it was an absolute disgrace.
El Pollo Rico,3,Stop what you re doing and come get their burritos  That thing is HUGE. It comes packed with your choice of meat  I did Al Pastor  AKA spiced pork   refried beans  rice  lettuce  pico  sour cream  and guacamole     The best part   It only costs  7.69  Insane. Way better than Chipotle or any other place in town  especially since this place offers authentic Mexican styles of cooking which makes this burrito way more delicious than the rest. Plus... Guac at no extra cost  Yes please.   With that said  this place gets a solid 5 5 in my book  They get the job done. No funny stuff. Check them out   If you dine-in  don t have high expectations regarding the interior as it looks like a  hole in the wall .
El Pollo Rico,4,If your looking for homemade Mexican style cooking  this would be your go to every time. It s very convenient  and very tasty  I go here whenever I m unsure on what to eat. It s by far the best fast food Mexican spot out in Texas  and should extend their business everywhere else in this world. You can tell they use real products  no processed food really what so ever. I m saying fast food  because the wait times is very short  some of their restaurants have drive thru s. So please do not compare this to Taco Bell  taco cabana  or el pollo loco      This spot also have that horchata you re looking for as well lol.  Chefs kiss
El Pollo Rico,5,Azael and michelle are horrible at serving please be aware when you place an order you have to remind them probably multiple times
El Pollo Rico,6,Quality grilled chicken. They give you a lot of food for cheap. It s all about that green sauce  some quality corn tortillas  a grilled onion and some rice and beans  though they also have other sides that I didn t know existed . Just put a bit of everything into a corn tortilla and you re in chicken heaven.  Only con was when we came late  they kinda tried to rush us out and only gave us to go - service was a bit lacking. We ended up just scarfing down our food in the restaurant in the remaining time left  but at least they gave us extra sides for the inconvenience.
El Pollo Rico,7,Simply amazing   Super clean restaurant. I came in as a walk-in and was helped quickly . My food didn t take long to come out . Food was hot and fresh     Meat so tender it melts in your mouth  
El Pollo Rico,8,Waited 35 minutes for a small order just to be told they just started it. Store wasn t busy and reason why I m leaving a review is because the employees lacked a sense of urgency and just played up front
El Pollo Rico,9,I go to the one in Manor all the time and never had issues. Tonight i had to wait 20 minutes for a burger  which was as hard as hockey puck.   No thanks   I ll stick with the one in manor   
El Pollo Rico,10,Bad service  food incomplete we had to pay for something that was already supposed to be included. The waitress then comes laughing when she delivers our BURNT food . Overall F the people that work there I won t recommend it at all.
El Pollo Rico,11,Man.   I was surprised at the superb quality and tastiness of the chicken here. While customer service was average at best  and the decor is reminiscent of pollo hermanos from breaking bad  the food more than makes up for it.   Rice and beans  On point. Tortillas  Very good. I would recommend you try out pollo Rico.
El Pollo Rico,12,Pollo Rico is the sky. You know can always depend on it to be blue and it s everywhere. This location is no different from all the other locations and is always dependable for some good food that s quick.   We always order a whole chicken meal and it comes in under  20. They have to inject something into their chicken because it lasts a couple meals and stays just as good from the microwave as it does from the restaurant. Why did I write this review though  I was hungry and lazy one night. I really really had a hankering for a torta and the other restaurants were you know  an extra 2 minutes away. Oh the distance  the humanity. But this Pollo Rico was about to close but were nice enough to stay open to get me my sammich. The chicken inside was their rotisserie charcoal chicken so that was good. The veggies were fresh and the bread soaked up all the flavor. The load of fries you get could possibly feed Riverside for a while too. Good staple to always have in your back pocket.
El Pollo Rico,13,Came here a few mornings ago  about 15 minutes before my bus was due. Thought that would be plenty of time for a fast food place.   Ordered 2 breakfast burritos  waited about 25 minutes. Bus was late  amp  we still missed it. Burrito was good so whatever. Still got to work on time.  Two days later  we give ourselves 30 minutes to spend at this place. ALL SIGNS SAY THEY OPEN AT 8 30AM. At 8 43am we walk up. Door is locked  sign isn t on  lady inside just looks at us.  If you aren t going to open at the correct time  then change your signs. How difficult is that  Attempted to try this place twice. There won t be a third attempt. I don t enjoy wasting my time.
El Pollo Rico,14,Food is good and all.. BUT till this day I don t understand why they would place a manager with ZERO PATIENCE   Can t handle the  manager  position at all. Or at least when it comes to customer service.
El Pollo Rico,15,This place is super clean. Food is ready and pretty good. The staff is pretty nice. Not all fluff and oooh and ahhs. You order your food and you get it. No fuss not muss. Not to say that they lack any kind of enthusiasm. They re working and they re good at it. I like it. Right next door is this dance hall or space for rent that has social events like quinceneras and dances and regular Mexican people stuff. It s kinda cool. I ve heard ppl describe the area as kind of bad... I just chalk that up to low-key racism. Food is good. Atmosphere is very local. Def five starts.
El Pollo Rico,16,I have always seen this restaurant around town. Never stopped by for whatever reason.  The first time I ate their food was at a bday party. Since then I have been hooked  must have eaten there 3 times that week.  Their ckicken is awesome  The seasoning used for the chicken is delicious.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I literally lick my fingers  thats how good it is. The green sauce is spicy but delicious. I did try a gordita once  amp  I did not enjoy that. I will definitely return  maybe as early as tomorrow.
El Pollo Rico,17,If possible- avoid this place. The atmosphere is that of a fast food place  which isn t bad  necessarily . What is worrisome is the food quality and price.  3 for one taco is not what the Founding Fathers had in mind. The quality is mediocre  nothing special to tell friends about. 5 10  at best.
El Pollo Rico,18,Some of the best roasted chicken in town.  A whole chicken is affordable and can easily feed 2-3 people.
El Pollo Rico,19,You can get a half chicken  rice  beans  and tortillas for  8.99  Chicken is moist  juicy  and well-marinated. Comes with grilled onion and free salsas...
El Pollo Rico,20,You can t go wrong with the Half Chicken Meal Combo.  The green sauce is like crack   But be careful...
El Pollo Rico,21,This place is way over priced for mediocre food. I spent  22 on 5 tacos. I ordered chicken  barbacoa and shrimp tacos. The chicken taco was decent - but it had a weird red sauce mixed in that I didn t care for. The barbacoa taco was good  tender  flavorful and it generously portioned. The shrimp taco  I was just taken aback. Literally like wtf is this  I swear it was fried chicken bits from Churches. I asked for corn tortillas  so of course they gave me flour. The rest of our party orderd taco or chicken plates  which comes with a side of charro beans and rice. Well  we could literally count all 8 beans and all 12 grains of rice - they re obviously on a budget or something because the sparse amount of sides was pathetic  laughable. The interior is rough and cleanliness is questionable. Our table had two napkin dispensers  both of which were empty. We won t be back.
El Pollo Rico,22,Same great food as the other locations but with new fancy menus on big LCD tvs.  This location is in a former Chinese restaurant s home and still sports a GIGANTIC backlit photo on the wall of what appears to be a Buddhist Temple lol. It looks very out of place  but whatever... I come here for the chicken  not the decor   
El Pollo Rico,23,Great chicken and my cashier Jessica  according to my receipt   straight hair  amp  short  who made me feel welcome here she is a great and knows how to treat customers.   This chicken is amazing. It was worth my time and money well spent. I will definitely will come here again and enjoy my favorite food to eat. I am so satisfied.
El Pollo Rico,24, 15 for a whole family meal    You can t beat that and also make it tasty... We love this meal for those work nights that nobody wants to cook. It comes with a whole chicken al carbon  rice  beans  tortillas  salsa  onions and a lemon   
El Pollo Rico,25,My neighbors have hyped this place for a long time  and I finally got around to trying it yesterday.  It was amazing   I just had a quesadilla  but it was the best quesadilla I ve had in a very long time.  The salsa are excellent as well.  I definitely recommend this place in lieu of any fast food places.
El Pollo Rico,26,The first time I walked in  I said to the young female working   Hi  I ve never been here before   I was hoping for a suggestion. What I got in response was a half smile  not a single word  and  eyes that quickly went over my shoulder and out the window. After looking at the big menu board for a moment  I ask her if she spoke English  She said yes. I asked if she had heard what I said when I came in. She said yes. We looked at each other for a moment  then I left. That was a one star review. It took many weeks before I went in again. I ve eaten there several times since  and the food is okay. 3 stars.
El Pollo Rico,27,Horrible staff and very bad costumer service can t ever get a hold of management definaly don t recommend it
