El Tizon Del Chef,1,Now open behind corner bar on south Lamar  Really amazing food  everything is fresh and just awesome  Would highly recommend.   Still amazing food however they have moved locations now they are in front of the warehouse bar off of 290 
El Tizon Del Chef,2,We suspect this man may be racist as he was very rude to my African American friend. We will not be giving him our business anymore because we do not support racist business owners he was very rude to my black friend but instead extremely kind to my white friends they will never ever come see this guy again and they tipped the guy and he was still rude. And we all got a shit now .
El Tizon Del Chef,3,Best tacos  The carne asada is amazing. Also the chips for the nachos are the good chips not the store bought kind that fall apart and you left with a bunch of broken pieces. He is now at 4301 duval st and 43th st.
El Tizon Del Chef,4,The pastor tacos and quesadillas are the best I ve ever had  Seriously  this little stand outside The Warehouse is legitimately a hidden gem. Do yourself a favor and go get some pastor tacos from this guy. And be sure to use the green sauce 
El Tizon Del Chef,5,A delicious little taco truck open late just outside and in front of Warehouse Bar and Billards  It has a cute  little menu with the basics classics and their Pastor tacos do not disappoint  The man and perhaps owner who is always working is very friendly and I am happy to support local business. Come eat here for a late night taco fix 
El Tizon Del Chef,6,Context  From Los Angeles  and have eaten lots of Mexican street-style tacos.   So the deal with Mexican street style tacos  you aren t going to get all the fancy sauces and toppings. But you shouldn t. Because these tacos are about the MEAT. No creamy sauces to cover anything up  there s nowhere to hide.   It s about the meat  with a smattering of onions and cilantro  a squeeze of lime for brightness  and a dash of salsa for heat. But it s about the meat. And oh man  is the meat here tasty. ESPECIALLY the barbacoa.   Went for the first time yesterday and ordered a barbacoa taco and a pastor taco. That barbacoa is BOMBBBBBB. Generous heaping of insanely delicious meat. It was so flavorful  fatty  and tender that at times  I thought I might have been eating braised pork belly. Whatever this meat was stewing in has been so well flavored and so well simmered that all the meat has the flavor sticky and stuck onto the meat. Get this.   The pastor was decent  but not close to the best pastor I ve had. It has flavors  yes  but the meat wasn t as juicy as pastor should be. Seemed more like crumbled ground pork than something carved off a spit. Did get a nice slice of pineapple in the taco  but I will cycle through all other meats before deciding whether I need to come back to this one.  I ll update again after I ve gone a few times. I usually wait to review places that I think are good until I ve been there multiple times  but goddamn this place deserves more customers STAT    Note  This is a nice easy place to stop and grab a quick bite before heading for an evening of climbing at Crux 
El Tizon Del Chef,7,Great tacos  Barbacoa is fantastic. I recommend you try them. The chef has a great attitude and is quick  Dont forget to tip  
El Tizon Del Chef,8,I had these tacos for the first time last night and was seriously blown away by the flavor  I am so happy that we happened to stumble across this gem of a taco truck in South Austin. It was so incredible that we ordered twice so that we could have tacos for the next day  The man whom I believe is also the owner is extremely friendly and he puts so much care into preparing your food. We had the carne asada  al pastor  carnitas  bean and cheese tacos as well as queso and fries. Everything was truly exceptional. The red and green salsas also complimented the tacos in every way. I am so excited to come back and I will be taking all my family members here when they visit  You will not be disappointed 
El Tizon Del Chef,9,Outstanding--I had 2 pastor  1 Barbacoa  and 1 carnitas.  All were made authentic with fresh tortillas and seasoned to perfection.  4 homemade tacos for  11--it doesn t get any better.
El Tizon Del Chef,10,Amazing and authentic food. Little food truck right behind the Texaco. Is a MUST have.
El Tizon Del Chef,11,I ve been to all of the good taco stands in the area and this one is the best   The pastor taco was my favorite. The salsas were fresh and very well seasoned. My girlfriend s family is from Mexico and she s obviously spent a lot of time there. If she says it s legit  it is.  People need to quit posting reviews about delivery service items especially considering how bad traffic can be. You re going to force these businesses to stop delivering all together. Some people just like to bitch  I guess.
El Tizon Del Chef,12,Amazing quesadilla  the cheese is great. My chicken taco was flavorful and juicy. I wouldn t order the rice or beans again but it s a taco truck and the tacos were really amazing so it still gets 5 stars 
El Tizon Del Chef,13,Great food. The chef owner is kind  funny and very dedicated to his cooking  Ask about specials if they aren t obviously on the menu board. He had amazing shrimp empanadas when we went. After he fried em  he cracked open the top and stuffed some guac  lettuce  mayo and... maybe pico in there. The shrimp were delicious... way better than your average low quality taqueria shrimp.  The tacos were great... his pastor with grilled pineapple is amazing and again it s not the usual cherry-red  artificially colored funky pork you get some places. The barbacoa is delicious as well. Tender  moist and fatty just like it should be.  He sampled us some great chips he had fried up made of some unidentified tropical tuber he had picked up at the market that day. Similar to a yucca or plantain chip but a bit lighter and more flavorful.  After we finished our meal  he also gave us each a chip with a taste of a red cabbage and jalape o jam he had made for a previous fish taco special. It was perfectly sweet  spicy and purple.  The standards on the menu were all good and the specials have some creative touches that you don t get at any old sloppy taco truck. This guy really knows and loves what he does.
El Tizon Del Chef,14,Great tacos and tortas. Remind me of some of my favorite spots back in Houston. The man who works there is nice as well.
El Tizon Del Chef,15,First of all the food is amazing. This man cut me a fresh avocado I heard all the sizzles coming from the truck as he was cooking  Presentation was beautiful even in a to go box  So so yummy.
El Tizon Del Chef,16,A M A Z I N G FOOD   Had the torta de milanesa  tacos de pastor and de carnitas...YUMMY 
El Tizon Del Chef,17,I come here after work all the time  I work at the florist across the street  and it is amazing  I always get 3 of whatever I order. The food takes a little time to make but that s how you know it s good  especially from a food truck. They don t open until 6pm at least  so it s great for an evening snack. Please go here    Support this business   
El Tizon Del Chef,18,Two visits in the last couple of months and everything has been great. Fresh tortillas  full flavored pastor  juicy barbacoa and spicy salsas. Unpretentious and delicious 
El Tizon Del Chef,19,I hate knocking anyone while they re down  or just knocking businesses in general  but this place does warrant the 2 star review I am now writing.  I ordered food through a 3rd party delivery app  and was specific in my requests. While I admire that they cared enough to heed to my requests for no tortillas  what bothered me was that the fajitas I ordered were supposed to include sour cream  they don t offer free guacamole with fajitas as most other places do  but hey  there s sour cream  so I thought . I received my dish with zero sour cream  and paid almost  2 extra to add salsa to this order filled with fajitas and tacos  and only got a handful of thimble-sized salsas that I feel should have or would have been included anyway. The overall flavor was  I guess  decent  but not really up to par with any other local joint I ve ever tried. As I did see another Yelper mention  and am in alliance with them on this  the food is bland and not at all flavorful. Overall  disappointing.
El Tizon Del Chef,20,Friends and I have been frequenting this place for almost a year now. Not big on writing reviews but had to give this place 5 stars. The tacos are consistently delicious and the owner is a great guy. Among the best in town for sure.
El Tizon Del Chef,21,This guy s food is mui bueno  I can t say anything bad about it. Tacos are bomb  nachos are bomb  all of it is bomb  I eat here at least once a week 
El Tizon Del Chef,22,The beef fajitas are made of cheap thinly cut fatty pieces. The beans and rice are very bland. The tomatoes in the beans are clearly canned from the store. Everything is bland and not what you would expect from proper Mexican food. This place may want to move to the mid west were they ve never had authentic Mexican food   but I m a native Texan and I call bull shit on this place. I gave them 2 stars cause they delivered this shit to my door.
El Tizon Del Chef,23,Do not order delivery. It took 97 minutes when it should have taken 60  as the restaurant said it would. I only ordered 4 tacos and the place is only 5 minutes away according to Google Maps. The food was  okay  and when it got here it was barely warm.
El Tizon Del Chef,24,I m from Mexico City so I know a thing or two about a good taco. This place is fast becoming one of my favorite joints in the city to go get some authentic Mexican food. The chef really knows his stuff and he is passionate about his work. Genuinely a very nice person as well. I was at crowbar once and came out to order some food and he offered to bring it to my table outside. It s a small thing but the gesture really got to me. I love the carne asada tacos from here. The nopal this guy buys is far superior to most of what you ll find around town. The tortillas are actually served at the correct temperature  a lot of local restaurants and trucks should take a hint from this guy . I wish it opened earlier but I understand its 6 pm opening time since it stays open into the early hours of the morning. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a taco that would pass with flying colors in interior Mexico. The green salsa is also the bomb by the way.
Rules & Regs,1,A solid spot for a beverage. we were in town and I had been looking for a good sunset spot at one of the many rooftop bars and restaurants. The town was pretty booked but Rules  amp  Regs wasn t as popular a spot so we were able to just show up.  We road up the elevator and stepped out to the rooftop.  It was nothing initially.  The smell of the pool and kids running around the pool as the sun was setting.  I believe there was a few spots to sit outside but we saddled up to the bar inside.   it was a nice bar  with subtle lighting.  The bar keep came up quickly and asked for our order.  I ordered a little off the menu  and my gal ordered something they didn t have on the drink list at all.  But he knew his drinks and made both quickly and on point.  My Caucasian was tasting and her french75 was perfect. its by far not the most popular rooftop in Austin  but its a nice spot to stop in.
Rules & Regs,2,Do you like smoking cigars with an amazing view    Then The Fairmont Rules  amp  Regs is your spot. You can bring your own cigar or purchase one from them.  Enjoy the view and the breeze.
Rules & Regs,3,The location is great and the view is amazing. It s the perfect spot for a before dinner cocktail or a night cap. I m giving this spot three stars based off of our experience. Arriving 5 minutes after I received a text stating our table is ready  while also trying to call the place to inform them we would be late using the number given on the open table reservation link which no one answered... the hostess informed us for future reference we should call to let them know we are going to be late. Our waiter was phenomenal and took great care of us. However  we did order guacamole and it took about 45 minutes to come.
Rules & Regs,4,We came here for the Halloween bingo drag brunch. That was so much fun and that part gets 5 stars. However if I was to do this again I would eat elsewhere and just have drinks. I had the pork pozole which was a verde  I don t recall it saying if it was verde or rojo which I prefer but no biggie. It just lacked any flavor or salt. I never salt my food and had to hunt down salt and literally salt every bite because it was so bland. The guacamole was also the blandest guacamole I ve ever had. You d also think for the price they would heat the chips but you would be mistaken. Now onto the coffee. It is brunch after all and some of us need to warm up and wake up. Asked for half  amp  half and was brought skim milk. Gross. What is the purpose  All it does is make your coffee cold with a weird color. So I asked for the cream. My friend asked for a hot coffee with Bailey s. Manager brought over iced coffee with Bailey s and we told him. So he went to get another one but said we could have the drink. Meanwhile I m still waiting on cream my coffee is getting cold. And I m not kidding. I finally got cream but told them I was going to need a new hot coffee and sugar. This is like 20 minutes later. I make the long trek to use the restroom and on my way back I asked bartender for sugar. No sugar behind bar so yet another person has to hunt down sugar. Anyway coffee is cold so never mind. Btw we got there at 10 45 and were done eating way before bingo started and it got busy. And it wasn t like the service was bad  we had like every server at one point but not one could find cream or sugar. They also tried to charge us for the coffee drink they messed up and 3 other coffees. They took off bill but shouldn t have even had to ask. So booze and bingo is your winner for this place.
Rules & Regs,5,First time at Rules  amp  Regs at one of my stays at the Fairmont. My friend and I came here for a late morning brunch. It s located on the 7th floor of the Fairmont  so easily accessible if you re a guest at the hotel. And since it s on the 7th floor  it has some amaaazing views of downtown Austin.  The restaurant bar is very large  They have seating to accommodate a ton of different party sizes. From long tables booths to seated areas and table tops to bar seating and a huge outdoor patio with couches  tables  etc.  Since it s October and freakin  BEAUTIFUL outside  we opted to sit on the patio which was a great choice. It was a Saturday morning  and surprisingly very chill. Only 1 or 2 other guests in the restaurant  I believe they re busier in the evenings for dinner .  The server was very kind but also very slow. Considering there was only 2 other tables in the entire restauraunt  we expected the server to be a little more attentive. We had to ask him multiple times to take orders or get things.  The food though was fantastic   We ordered the roasted poblano queso  yum   the avocado tostada  and the eggs entomatadas and pork belly  SO YUM        Would definitely come back during my stay at the Fairmont but would probably not come for a regular meal if I was not staying at the hotel.
Rules & Regs,6,I wanted to like this place more than I did. It s situated next to the pool area which is convenient. Nice bar and standard dining area w a larger patio outdoor seating as well. My friend and I each tried a cocktail  the carne asada and the Birria tacos. The disappointment came from the portion sizes ratio to prices being charged. The drinks and food were almost half the size of what I would get elsewhere. Flavor wise the food was decent enough  I ve had much better Birria tacos in Austin  more authentic ones. You do get the view of the pool right next to it. Overall It s a cute place to stop in for a quick drink or small bite to eat.
Rules & Regs,7,Visit this place for the drinks and the sunset views  They are truly incredible  It s a great place for a date night or just a night out with friends. The staff was very friendly and the drink menu had a ton of options. They only use premium and high quality liquors and mixes for all of their drinks so it s totally worth it  Also  this place is reservation only  The bar is open but if you want a view of the sunset  you have to make a reservation.
Rules & Regs,8,Honestly  it s a pretty mediocre  rooftop  bar. Their drinks are incredibly overpriced and generic  and service was meh. The hostess barely looked in our direction when we asked for the restroom.   I honestly have no idea why this place is serving cocktails for  16-19. Those are New York prices. For the quality of drinks  7th floor views  and mediocre service  Rules  amp  Regs is not worth it.
Rules & Regs,9,Rules  amp  Regs inside the Fairmont on the 7th floor by the pool has a great patio and view of downtown Austin. Went for drinks and snacks and enjoyed them all. The snack was salmon ceviche which was really good. I got it with tortilla chips which were much better than the chicharrones. Ceviche had great flavor and although it was pricey  I made a good choice. I also had to get the Mexican chocolate pavlova which is similar to a crunchy meringue. For my drink  I got the rebellious gecko which was very refresher. Server wasn t too attentive but he was new. Very relaxing vibe here. I highly recommend it.
Rules & Regs,10,Great view and good vibe. Drinks middling and service was  slow .Worth checking out for the ambience but the draw ends there
Rules & Regs,11,It was an amazing experience from begging to end  the hostess was attentive and very polite  our server  De Marcus   was able to guide us through the birthday celebration. I came to celebrate my girlfriends birthday and they went above and beyond  The view was stunning  the drinks were delicious and the food was delish 
Rules & Regs,12,Amazing view of downtown. Makes you feel like you re in NYC. Really great guacamole and beef brisket tacos. Service wasn t the best but it was still a great time.
Rules & Regs,13,I was skeptical because it wasn t busy  but the two brunch items we had were incredibly delicious.  The chicken with mole was amazing  so tender  smoky in a subtle way and slightly sweet.  Generous portions.  My husband had the egg with an amazing slab of fork tender pork belly in a tasty sauce. Wish I tried it earlier in my stay at the Fairmont.
Rules & Regs,14,Incredible view reserve for later since the view is better after sun goes down.  Great drinks.  Menu is really limited wish they had more options but drinks are the best and views can t be beat.  Since the Fairmont is further away from the rest of the city you get a really great view of the rest of the city.
Rules & Regs,15,Views and SERVICE     What a great spot to soak up our beautiful city. Alif is the only server we will sit with. His service is not only 5 stat it is truly GENUINE  The service Industry in Austin is suffering yet Alif is happy to serve and deliver the best service. Thank you for being you and so genuine. We will forever follow you wherever the season takes you   
Rules & Regs,16,It was ok. Highly overpriced for the amount of portions they give. I ordered the guacamole and the beef tacos and one drink.  58was a bit expensive only not to be satisfied.
Rules & Regs,17,Perfect night. Outdoors 7 stories up with view of downtown Austin. Hip and trendy. Highly recommend getting a drink and enjoying the view and spending time with those you live. Will be back 
Rules & Regs,18,Staying at the hotel  ordered a Bandera salad from the pool.  I was surprised to see the small amount of salad and no smoked chicken- upon further digging  found two bites of chicken at the bottom.   On my way out  saw a waiter brought out the same salad to another patron with twice as much chicken on top of twice as much salad than what I got.    Do they think people sitting by the pool should eat only half in order to look good in bikinis   Don t know what they put in the salad dressing  I have been dinking water for 3 hours afterwards and still feel thirsty.
Rules & Regs,19,Absolutely delightful  I stayed at the hotel and I was very impressed with the service  the view and the food.. which was mouthwatering. Ordered the chips with guacamole and queso  and don t  even get me started with the cheese fries  runny cheese  sour cream  cilantro  SUPER YUM.  AND the best part they have frozen Rose  wayyy too good .
Rules & Regs,20,The drinks  amp  ambiance were fantastic  The guac was perfect. However  menu was extremely small  service was poor  and the food was mid. Left overchanged and undersatisfied. Only come here for drinks and vibes  EPIC FAIL
Rules & Regs,21,This place has an amazing view   The food was great and our server  Nick was super personable and friendly  The drinks were also made for Instagram. Service and drinks were fantastic 
Rules & Regs,22,While staying at the Fairmont  we saw that there was a rooftop pool and bar so OF COURSE we had to check it out.  The bar is located on the 7th floor and has a beautiful view of the city  It faces the gorgeous pool and has open windows and garage style doors to be able to enjoy the sometimes nice Austin weather.   We ordered 2 beers and an order of  dirty fries  that were a great snack while we planned our evening in Austin.  The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was nice and casual during the 5pm time we were there. I m sure this bar turns into a much nicer place once it gets dark.  Next time I m in Austin and staying at the Fairmont  I will be sure to check out this place again.
Rules & Regs,23,I don t have much to say except - Cocktails. City view. Pool. Modern setting. Just come.
Rules & Regs,24,Many positives include the view of the Austin skyline  especially in the evening   the drinks  and the food. The atmosphere and interior design is bright  intimate  and relaxing.  The only downside is the extremely slow service from the waitstaff  Thankfully there is a great view  if dining on the deck . I am assuming they are understaffed because someone should not wait a total of ONE HOUR  not exaggerating  from the time they sit down until the time they receive their order of chips and guacamole.
Rules & Regs,25,Had heard about this  rooftop bar  in an online search for things to do around Austin  so of course I had to check this out. I was pretty disappointed with the experience. First off  even though the Fairmont has like 27 floors or something like that  Rules  amp  Regs was located on the 7th. Far from being on the  rooftop.  The view was nothing special - you just get to stare at the buildings across the way from your seat on the lounge chair. If you look down  sure you see some streetlights  but you re looking at sleepy streets  not hustling and bustling city streets.   I ordered a moscow mule here and my drink was super gingery. Not bad necessarily  just unexpected. The food options did look decent although we were coming from dinner so weren t hungry.
Rules & Regs,26,I just went to Rules  amp  Regs since I m staying at the Fairmont for the first time. I saw in the reviews the view is really nice so I wanted to try this place. BAD IDEA. I made a reservation online but I never got the text with the notification that the table was ready. When we approached the host she said she  forgot to text us.   She sat us on a super dark table cause that was the only one available outside. I asked her if she was taking our drink order  but she said a server would be right over. We took pictures of the city lights and catch up with social media. The server NEVER came. I went to asked the bar tender if he could take my order. He told me with an attitude that it was not possible  but he sent a server. We gave our food and drink order. He delivered the drinks and the food  but he did not bring any silverware. We ate a super tiny  22 FLAVORLESS TUNA plate with our fingers and chips. Needless to say  we almost walked out of these place.
Rules & Regs,27,Adelaide  our server  really stole the show today. Great service and attention to detail. Thank you     I m happy to report that despite initial slow service  the management team at the Fairmont and Rules  amp  Reg have exceeded our expectations in service. The pool grounds and bar are beautiful. The drinks are refreshing and the view memorable. I ordered the guacamole from the adjacent restaurant and it was very fresh and delicious. Thank you go the staff for improving our experience.
Rules & Regs,28,Fantastic restaurant and ambiance    My husband and I popped in here for lunch today while at a conference.   Hubby got fish tacos and I ordered chicken tacos.  OUT OF THIS WORLD    The bar tender was super friendly and knowledgeable and informed us that there is a different menu for dinner.   We had a friend coming into town in the evening so we knew we would be back    We came back a few hours later and had some fabulous cocktails and more delicious food.   Portion size really is more snack appetizer size but it s great if you order a few dishes to share    When we were finishing up the chef came out and offered to share a brand new dish for us to try.   A beautiful Ahi Tuna dish was served for us to try out and it did not disappoint    We are in town for a week and we plan to make several more visits to this restaurant before going back home 
Rules & Regs,29,Slow service. 20 minutes before we received chips and salsas...Then took my card because I wouldn t order alcohol. Have eaten there plenty of times and have never had that happen. Food drenched with grease.
Rules & Regs,30,Extremely rude bartender here. After sitting at the bar  we had been there the night before and had a great time with a few drinks looking at the skyline   we were told by the bartender that  we didn t look like their kind of customer  and asked to leave  because you  we  looked like trouble.   uhm - ok - rude.
Rules & Regs,31,The lobster roll and scallops tasted great. It was rather late with very few customers. Somehow  my server didn t spend much time on my table.
Rules & Regs,32,You know that at any Fairmont Hotel just ain t gonna be lousy. I love to smoke a cigar in the late afternoon and to my surprise I found the perfect perch for this occasion. The Rules and Regs bar at the Fairmont has a 7th floor patio that overlooks the city and there is a designated area that is smoke happy. I have posted a twilight image from my favorite table. You can get food served out on the patio as well. I love the Tuna Poke bowl. Rules and Regs is one of mine and my wife s favorite afternoon destinations in Austin.
Rules & Regs,33,Rules  amp  Regs is such a chill rooftop bar  Located on the 7th floor of the gorgeous Fairmont Hotel  it showcases the city of Austin perfectly  It s breathtaking  Immediately my boyfriend and I were greeted as we sat down at the bar to order cocktails. Super nice bartenders  Not sure why some reviews are bad  they must have gotten rid of that dude   Drinks are amazing  food is awesome. The furniture is super comfy to sit back  relax and enjoy the sunset on a breezy summer night  Wish I could live here    
Rules & Regs,34,When you enter the lobby  make your way to the 7th floor for Rules  amp  Regs. The bar staff was super friendly. We had the Paloma and the Moscow mule  under and different name and made with ginger kombucha so the ginger wasn t as aggressive as with ginger beer  and sat on the deck overlooking both the 7th floor pool and downtown Austin. The guacamole was topped with cotija cheese and pumpkin seeds and absolutely delicious  a perfect complement to fresh  light drinks.
Rules & Regs,35,Great skyline views of downtown Austin from this patio bar. Great drinks poolside or on the terrace.
Rules & Regs,36,This is a sweet late night spot with a great view of the city  Tons of cool people and great food and drinks  Ask for Joe and get a Daisy Siesta   Watch the game  listen to a great DJ  and plan out your attack on the city 
Rules & Regs,37,I m so disappointed  when I called the number on google they told me they re open we walk a mile and they were close uh so furious 
Rules & Regs,38,I really love this bar. Can get crowded  but most times is a very comfortable  secluded spot to hang out with friends and watch the sun set from the balcony. Snacks  drinks and service are all excellent. Will definitely be back 
Rules & Regs,39,This is not just  bar  food  the food will knock your socks off   I ve been craving the  dirty fries  ever since I got back to Michigan  And those fried artichoke hearts.. simply the best   
Rules & Regs,40,Slow service and drinks not as good as other downtown Austin cocktail bars.  Probably just needs some management.
Rules & Regs,41,Great Pool  Nice cabana set up  Adult atmosphere  I got a cabana with  500 min. Service was impeccable  the waitress even brought drinks to us while in the pool. Charges were exactly as I expected with no surprises. The bar has great seating and is perfect for pre-party drinks and mingling. Not sure what the other comments on here are about  but seems questionable. I booked a Gold Jr Suite which was perfect and concierge was the best  Great ATX trip.
Taquerias Arandinas,1,I love this place    I ve been in Austin since 1979 and I ve eaten my share of Mexican food from the fancy and expensive  Fonda San Miguel  to the hole in the wall  to fast food  and everything in between....AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE hole in the wall  Let me count the ways  1. Deliciousness on fleek -- the three salsas they bring are sublime. One is the freshest pico ever  I couid eat a bowl. The second is a smooth green avocado something that s creamy and hot -- addicting. The third is a hot red sauce. All with warm chips -- so yumtastic. Oh  And the food -- super fresh and all delicious. 2. Price -- WHAT   I get beef fajita tacos that are served on warm tortillas with lime and lettuce and tomato that are soul satisfying and cost  2.20 each 3. Service -- you walk in  sit anywhere  and BOOM  You ve got chips and salsa in a second and then they take great care of you. I ve been known to eat lunch here three times a week. Almost embarrassing.  This place is a GEM.
Taquerias Arandinas,2,Wonderful hole in the wall  They give you 2 different salsas and one is extremely hot  and I went there with 3 latinos  I like spicy but just be prepared  The tortas were awesome  I had the torta de hamon  I want to go back and get the Hawaiian torta  I also tried the lingua tacos and they were very good as well.  I m waffling between 3.5 and 4 stars just because the service was slow  but the food was great 
Taquerias Arandinas,3,Food here is just great  good tacos  and varied menu that goes beyond the average Tex-Mex  they have tacos  tortas  quesadillas  caldos  and horchata Definitely feels authentic and everyone speaks Spanish  it s like going home without traveling. I can see some people being turned off by the vibe of the place  but if you are seeking a good authentic Mexican place  you should give this one a try.
Taquerias Arandinas,4,Ummm I called in my order the last definitely took the correct order because she repeated it back to me . I pick up the order and I had a large horchata   I tried it before I left and it was actually good so I asked to purchase a small one the young lady gave it to me on the house she was so sweet .. NOW get home excited to eat because I ve been craving a burrito since forever and I m very particular about my burritos I ordered the California burrito however I asked for no avocado and no lettuce and I wanted to add cheese... why did my burrito have avocado in it      No cheese barely any sour cream ... ate half threw the rest away . I salon order a kids enchilada for my kido when I placed the order the lady said I can add meat with no extra charge so I said chicken ... why was the enchilada just cheese yeah this place is a NO for me i didn t even take pictures because it was a hot mess
Taquerias Arandinas,5,Really good Mexican food.  A bit proxy for Mexican food  but understandable for the authenticity.
Taquerias Arandinas,6,Amazing. If you re from the valley  this will feel like home. Or  if you appreciate authentic Mexican food  you ll love this place.  Server spoke only Spanish. Good thing I took IB Spanish in high school  or else I would ve just pointed the whole time.  Migas. Amazing. 10 10. Cheesy. Delicious. Ugh  so good.  Chips and pico and salsa. Also good. Spicy and flavorful.  Carne asada and the taco plate. Also good. Carne asada CAME W CACTUS. It s like kimchi for your taco. Sour  but not too sour and adds a pop of flavor that compliments the dish well.  The flan is ok. They were out of tres leches  but I m sure that is good too.  Idk what other reviewers are talking about w the water    It tastes fine to me lol no weird aftertaste or anything. When we walked in for dinner  it was empty. An hour in and barely any seats are left.  This place is pretty hidden  and maybe that s why there are only 32 reviews. But yeah  def try this place  It s not fancy or anything  and it s what you d expect a hole in the wall place to be like. Delicious  authentic  and feels like home  if you re from the valley or similar place .
Taquerias Arandinas,7,This was fantastic. Chilaquiles with chicken and eggs  12.99. HUGE PORTIONS everything had great flavor and nothing was too salty. Salsa verde was limey  salsa roja was fire  Definitely coming back
Taquerias Arandinas,8,I got a little early to my hotel and I was starving so they couldn t check me in and they sent me to the nearest restaurant which was this taqueria of course. I wasn t real sure because I m Mexican and I live in Mexico and I usually don t like to eat Mexican out of Mexico but this was a good place it reminded me to the Taqueria s in Mexico. The service was a little bad for me  maybe because I was so hungry but I got there I got my drink and then they took around 30 minutes to bring me just 2 tacos I think that s a lot of time for two tacos. They had chips and salsa for free and it was delicious that wad really cool. The tacos were just bad I didn t like them it was dry the eggs were very oily and the tortilla wasn t the best the rice and beans were just  meh  I actually feel really sorry for all the people that were there but most of them work for it so I guess that this is a more Mexican food they ve had pictures it takes wasn t good I just ate it because I was so hungry but I wouldn t recommend this place. I saw lot of people eating Menudo and it looked really good maybe that was the dish of the day I mean after all it was a Sunday  I wasn t in the mood of a boiling soup  but the tacos were really disappointing I expected more of this place because it looked real Mexican too bad
Taquerias Arandinas,9,Good Food  friendly service  with generously portioned meal. Will visit again on my next stay.
Taquerias Arandinas,10,I won t ever come back to this location again I called over the phone to try to place the order I was able to get part of the order then the girl on the no just said no English and hung the phone up I call back again she said no English right now sorry and hung up I drove up to the restaurant to try to place an order the same girl who was on the phone was the one at the front counter she said oh minimal English then gave me a menu and walked away she comes back I asked for the manager she said oh no baby the manager won t be here until tomorrow now it s funny how she doesn t speak any English but she s comprehend what I m saying and is speaking in English to me they need to have the option to order online because the people they have answering the phone are making them lose money
Taquerias Arandinas,11,Amazing little place  The food is delicious and the service very friendly and fast. We are staying in a hotel next door and this is our third time here in two days. We love it  
Taquerias Arandinas,12,Great place for authentic  Mexican food. As someone who never says  no  to tacos  I can say they have amazing breakfast and regular tacos  al pastor  and barbacoa are my personal favorites . Also a huge fan of their nachos and tamales. Boyfriend loves the enchiladas. Friendly staff. Nothing to complain about other than the fact that living nearby  and ordering from them frequently has caused me to put on a few pounds.
Taquerias Arandinas,13,The food is amazing. The service is terrible. After our waiter and then waitress not coming to check on the table for a very long time I raised my hand and Barbra who was eating there and not currently working came to ask what we needed. She then brought us drinks. She is a complete angel for working when her coworkers should have been and she was off work.
Taquerias Arandinas,14,Moving to Austin after spending two decades in Southern California still has me wishing for Mexican fare that tastes like it did back there. All this local Tex-Mex is OK  it s just not the same and I have a hard time quantifying the difference. One thing I do know is that the tastes were bolder all around back on the coast than anything I ve found hereabouts.  The food I miss the most are the succulent  rather large Machaca burritos that were a staple for me back in the day. Shredded beef  onions  peppers  scrambled egg and spices - seems simple enough  yes  I have searched all over the ATX area looking for this dish and when I discovered that Taquerias Arandinas offered something called  Machado  in a breakfast taco or plate I made it a point to check it out ASAP. Short answer - it was OK but it didn t taste like the SoCal Machaca that I crave.  The folks inside were all friendly  there was a nice mix of folks enjoying their meals and what looked like some margaritas served in stemmed fish bowls...Yowsa  Chips and two tasty salsas were served gratis  the chips were commercial and the salsas had a nice kick to them. The Machacado plate arrived in short order  looking good with a decent portion of the main course surrounded by tastier than usual refried beans and rice and some warm corn tortillas  all for  6.99 - a very fair price these days.  However the machacado tasted little like the machaca I was used to  it was a bit of a disappointment but only because I had expectations - setting those aside the dish was fine but I personally wished for more. During my meal a couple of Tejano musicians played the heck out of their button Hohner accordion and a guitar that had seen better days. They sang well too  performing a couple of songs in Spanish like they d been doing them for years. I enjoyed them  it was a nice and unexpected touch.  The service was prompt  the folks were friendly  the food was fine  for what it was  and the cost was reasonable. I will continue my search for the tasty machaca from my past but I suspect I may not find what I m looking for here in Tex-Mex land. That says more about me than it says about the restaurant so don t be afraid to give this local chain a try.
Taquerias Arandinas,15,The tacos were pretty well cooked and the torta was good. Menu would be helpful if there were more English but that s fine. Interior could improve as well but the experience here was worth it.
Taquerias Arandinas,16,The food is OK. The service is terrible. They will forget about you and not refill your drinks or ask you how anything is. Avoid this location and go to the one on Riverside. It is much better.
Taquerias Arandinas,17,I was extremely impressed with this place  even though I expected the food to be average. We ordered 5 tacos  lengua  pastor and carne asada  and they were all AMAZING and very filling for the cheap price. The waitresses were polite  amp  helpful and the salsa wasn t the regular soupy tomato sauce. Would definitely come back in a heart beat for this authentic food 
Taquerias Arandinas,18,Best enchiladas I ve ever tasted. I ve ordered them at least 5 times now. Chicken verde enchiladas  And  they re about the only place I don t have to request extra cheese. Most of their menu looks amazing so maybe next time I ll try something new.
Taquerias Arandinas,19,The salsa is perfect. There was a huge language barrier between the server and I which made getting a veggie burrito impossible. Had they not already had one non-meat option on the menu I would have had to leave. Despite that the food was great. Wish they d add a few vegan vegetarian options  might come back but with a menu upgrade I d hit this spot up regularly.
Taquerias Arandinas,20,Not fancy. Not trendy. Just delicious and authentic mexican food  The chicken enchiladas were great. I m not usually a rice and beans person but they were amazing. They serve a spicy hot sauce type salsa along with a delicious regularly spicy salsa.
Taquerias Arandinas,21,Amazing food and service. We had the taquitos platter and huaraches and everything was delicious   
Taquerias Arandinas,22,headed out for a quick taco breakfast this morning with the fam.   pulled up to this taqueria  open the car door AND THE SMELL OF ROTTING HUMAN SHIT fills the car. it is everywhere. i turn to my other half and ask what the fuck. he sees another man in the parking lot  who says  that shit bro   we are gagging at this point. I can t even take off my seatbelt. the husbands eyes are watering. the little Littles start crying  the dude in the parking lot is covering his nose and mouth as he tries desperately to get back into the car. it is like a scene from the end of times  as we feverishly gasp for some fresh air. my husband jumps back in the car  he tries to find something to cover his face with. I haven t even turned off the car at this point  so I throw the car into reverse and quickly try to get out of the shit stained parking lot. we pass by the septic tank truck that is connected to the taqueria  that has obviously having issues with their septic system. I can only imagine what the inside of the restaurant smells like and the kitchen  as human excrement particles are flying around. how is this place open  oh my god. i m speeding away  the smell of the depths of human bowels have consumed my practical family car  I roll down the windows  we are all screaming and yelling about the horrible smell that is wafting into our nostrils. fresh air begins to fill the car  amp  we can take a breath  without inhaling doody molecules.
Taquerias Arandinas,23,Service was fine. Food was not.   This is the type of place you d look at and think it s no frilla and all about the food. Jad the beef millenesa. Came out less than 5 minutes and stuck taste burnt. Disappointing.
Taquerias Arandinas,24,Good mini tacos was disappointed with the Al Pastor but everything else was great.  Water was gross but horchata and coffee were good.  Service was okay but they seemed to be too busy to be bothered with refills.  Prices are reasonable.  Overall good taco place fruit stand outside.
Taquerias Arandinas,25,Place looks like it s about to get shot up at any moment.  I ordered guacamole and they gave me sliced avocado.  Chorizo breakfast burrito was nasty.
Taquerias Arandinas,26,Good Tex-Mex food with early and late hours in an area that has more bad than good choices for fast food cheap eats.  Great choice for breakfast or a late night supper.  They need a taller sign  you can t see it from the highway  you have to know it s there  but I was stuck in a nearby cheap motel saving money  so I drove by  drove in  and liked it enough to return a couple of times.  Stick with the tacos or burritos  it s what they do.
Taquerias Arandinas,27,This place straight-up RULEZZZ.   When it s morning and we re hungry and or hungover  it can not be beat for delicious cheesy migas and spicy red chilaquiles. Their salsa fresca is perfect. Literally perfect  fresh as hell and chunky like it should be. And their almost-too-red  What is in it    I don t care.  michelada is one of my favorites in town.  But  whoa  Lest ye think it s only good for breakfast  try these other non-breakfast things   Crispy beef tacos - unusual in that they use honest-to-god picadillo in these with peas and potato chunks in it. The meat is kinda-sorta-super greasy but man  it s good.  Cheese enchiladas - cheesy as fuck  awesome chile sauce Chicken flautas - okay  actually these can be a little dry inside  but they are also almost a foot long so if you like comically large food  this is for you  Plus  dip em in guacamole and ain t nothin  dry.  ANNNDDD to make everything that much better  all the waitstaff are SUPER nice and friendly and cute  too. ANNDDD sometimes on weekends there s mariachis that come in which is kind of horrible at first if you re real hungover but also kind of fun and eventually your ears get accustomed to it and they also only stay for like 3 songs.   If you re looking for any ambience besides  decorated by Goodwill  then you might want to look elsewhere. Personally I care not for such fancies as long as the food and service are good and this place gets 5 stars from me on both 
Taquerias Arandinas,28,The restaurant looks like your typical Taqueria. Nothing super fancy but what it lacks in looks it makes up in taste  The food is great  Taste like authentic Mexican food. The price was cheap  amp  not too busy. I m not sure what the hours are because I didn t see any posted on the door at the front or online. I will definitely suggest to people.
Taquerias Arandinas,29,Until I moved  this was my neighborhood taqueria.  I referred to it affectionately as  Taco Hut  since it s housed in a former Pizza Hut building  also previously known as India Hut  since there was an Indian restaurant before the taqueria .  I can t vouch for anything but their breakfast tacos and salsa  but those are delicious.  You can grab them to go  or dine in.  The servers don t always speak English fluently  but that s not really a problem for me  I can order tacos in Spanish.  I was pleasantly surprised during one of Austin s nastier ice storms to find that they were open  and I was able to walk over there and get a late breakfast  since work was closed.  Definitely a treat.
Taquerias Arandinas,30,Cheap eats and open late. Too bad the food is just mediocre.  With a goal of expanding my taqueria burrito repetoire  I stopped in at this location the other night to give it the once over.  The menu is pretty similar to other area taqueria - tacos  tortas  burritos  combo-plates  sopas  and some specialties.   First up - the salsa test  regular salsa  rojas  was good enough to keep eating  but I wouldn t come in special for it.  The roasted salsa tasted a bit funny  like not right  and was avoided the rest of the meal. Next - Entrees   I opted for the chicken burrito   3 . My dining companion tried the beef fajita nachos   6.50 .  The burrito was decent - perhaps a bit larger than some other places - and included the usual beans  leatuce  tomato and a touch of avocado.  Unfortunately I encountered 3-4 small bones in the chicken so I had to eat chew carefully. Not ideal. The chicken was just ok  but not too flavorful.  Tha nachos were pretty standard fare - big plate with chips  cheese  meat  guac  sour cream  and jalapenos. The beef fajita meat was ok - but a tad chewy.  Conclusions - reasonable cheap-priced taqueria food. Just not exciting enough  for me   to merit a second visit.
Taquerias Arandinas,31,I m from Cali  this is the real deal  Mexican food that is crazy good   Just had breakfast  will be back for dinner 
Taquerias Arandinas,32,Always great food at taquerias arandinas. I m eating here by myself now and since I have no one to talk to  might as well review  I ve been to most of their locations   there are like 5 of them   and have tried many items on the menu  every location has great food. If you haven t tried them yet- come and try them 
Taquerias Arandinas,33,I love this place because it reminds me of home.  The prices are so cheap  and the food is awesome. The tortillas are home-made  none of that store-bought paper tasting crap . They have bomb horchata too. You get complimentary chips and salsa like any other Mexican restaurant. I prefer the pico de gallo one. I always have to contain myself from filling up on chips and salsa before my food arrives. I have had their chicken fajitas  quesadillas  and tortas. It is all good.  The waitresses are always friendly. Keep in mind that most of them have very limited English.
Taquerias Arandinas,34,This quickly became my favorite place to eat in my neighborhood.    The tacos and burritos are so cheap I just couldn t justify eating fast food anymore.  The barbacoa  lengua  and al pastor is fantastic.   My other favorite dish is the Chile Relleno with a Horchata.     Cheap food  amp  a wonderful kitchen staff.  Sometimes they have homemade flan.
Taquerias Arandinas,35,Am here on business and staying at the Homewood suites. I was looking for something not run by a big corporation. This place was recommended to me by the woman at the front desk. Started with chips and 2 kinds of salsa and a beer. Had the enchiladas with chicken. Very tasty. Service was good but not great. Would totally go here again.
Taquerias Arandinas,36,Stupid me  I confused this place for Taqueria Arandas  and yes  there is a difference. I didn t realize it until my bff pointed it out when we drove by recently.  It was mid-day and the lunch crowd had made their way out. The boyfriend ordered the taco plate and I had the chicken mole. I was surprised to see mole on the menu  it s always been tough to find a mexican joint that serves this.   Tacos were pretty average according to him. The mole was chocolate based and after about five or six bites it became more sweet than savory. It was dessert chicken.   You can t beat the prices here though. I think our bill was about  18 with tip.
Taquerias Arandinas,37,Crispy tacos and California Burrito all the way  I like eating in or taking it to-go. I ve also tried the Mole Chicken Enchiladas and they were excellent as well. We re not talking gourmet  we re just talking quality well-priced mexican fare.
Taquerias Arandinas,38,Okay  so I feel a little apprehensive about rating this as a three star because  for what it is  it s perfect. This is a typical taqueria restaurant that serves really good Mexican food inexpensively.  When entering  the smell of hot corn oil was hanging in the air and eventually on me. I had to change my clothes before a meeting so I didn t offend anybody.  The waitresses were both very nice. As is par for most taquerias and pupuserias  telenovelas  Spanish language soap operas  were on the television.  They brought out chips and two types of salsa...a red and a green. For my main dish I had a bean burrito with a side of beans and Mexican rice  which had green beans  carrots  and peppers. To drink  I had melon  cantaloupe juice . I tried to explain in Spanish that I was vegetarian and the waitress suggested the chicken salad  so  judging by the other vegetarians  reviews  I d say this place is not going to adapt to the trends of America s health-conscious. If that s not a concern for you  this place s food is extremely tasty. My burrito came with beans  rice  salad and guacamole inside of it...the plate all together was around  5 and the drink was about  1.50.  Again  it s a great place so long as you accept it for what it is. The tofu burrito will not likely find its way onto this menu.
Taquerias Arandinas,39,I had the beef  picadillo  enchiladas with verde sauce. The sauce was spicy  as promised - yum   I would say that the food was workable but not recommendable.   The beans had very little  sabor  and the rice was yellow and boring. The beef filling had little bits of carrot and pea  I think  and was nothing to write home about.   The service was pleasant enough  be prepared to communicate in broken Spanish if you  no hablo  .   One thing I can say - the price is right. A good sized enchilada place for six bones plus change is not bad.
Taquerias Arandinas,40,This place makes the corn tortillas like in Mexico  When I first got my plate  carne asada   I asked for corn tortillas and when they came out with my food  I stopped and smelled the tortillas. It was Mexico  right under my nose. The tortillas have a soft texture  which is not what you get from store bought  or even ones made like from Milagros or HEB. This stuff is more doughy and delicious   Yum    I would definitely order things that aren t enchiladas or tex-mex  its good  but come on  you are in a Mexican restaurant  so try the real Mexican food  .... the carne asada is quite delicious  served with rice and beans and nopalitos  cacti   If you are not that hungry  shrimp cocktail is pretty good and not so filling. Oh and the salsas are actually spicy and yummy . I like this place for some good mexican food.  There are several in Austin  but I think the one on Riverside  is the one that  I go to  and I m not entirely sure if all of them serve real corn tortillas  but check out the one on Riverside .
Taquerias Arandinas,41,This is a great place to go after dieting for a while and you re at the point where you need large servings of greasy home cooking. I love everything I ve had here  The salsas are flavorful and always spicy. Also  when I ordered a cup of coffee and they were all out  they made a fresh pot for me.
Taquerias Arandinas,42,This place has it going on   Breakfast specials are cheap and the plates are full. I ordered the menudo and barbacoa tacos on the side .The bowl was huge with alot of carne and a large pigs foot .I ordered two tacos but I made three tacos out of all the meat it had. They have tradional american plates for 2.99 but  I need to go back to try those becuz no offense  that doesn t cure a hangover like MENUDO  can I get an AMEN     
Taquerias Arandinas,43,I love this place. It s cheap  has the ambience of a high school cafeteria  the salsa kicks ass  they serve topo chico  enormous cokes  there s never a wait  the jukebox plays terrible pop conjunto  and they have pralines for dessert. They have a unique verde sauce - I believe it s made with chili pequins. It s bitter in the most lovely way. Unfortunately  the beans are not vegetarian  but you can get a plate of three cheese enchiiladas with green sauce and stick to rice. The beans aren t VERY lardy...
Taquerias Arandinas,44,Good food  great prices.  I was just there tonight and the salsa wasn t as good as I remember  but the food was great.  This is one of my favorite places to get Al Pastor tacos.  Try the combination plate 
Taquerias Arandinas,45,Very delicious authentic Mexican food  best in Austin area  Service is great too. Recommend burritos  tacos  tortas  enchiladas and menudo   The horchata is awesome. Have not had anything that I don t recommend.
Taquerias Arandinas,46,Had a breakfast  2 2 2  two eggs  two ham  two pancakes  what I learned  Leaver it for ihop. The breakfast tacos are good  especially the fajitas. The rice is flavorless. The staffs is nice. Ok joint overall on breakfast.
Taquerias Arandinas,47,Breakfast dishes are legit and cheap. Chilaquiles are spot-on according to my Mexican friends.
Taquerias Arandinas,48,Mediocre. They have decent gorditas when they don t come back overcooked. Stick with the tacos or enchiladas. Pretty standard. Remember Arandas and not Arandinas.
Taquerias Arandinas,49,Yummy salsa  torta cubana is delish. Love that 2 people can eat breakfast here for  7 
Taquerias Arandinas,50,Cheap basic TexMex food  opens early and closes late.
Taquerias Arandinas,51,Cheap. Authentic. Nothing special to look at. Great salsa. AMAZING migas. In fact  these are the only migas in town I truly love. Worth going for breakfast--can t say anything  bout lunch or dinner.
Taquerias Arandinas,52,I dont really like the food but the strawberry margarita its delicious would like to go back and just buy a margarita  9
Taquerias Arandinas,53,I don t know why this place has even 2 stars   It was horrible   Canned beans... Are u serious  First I had a bug in my horchata and I let that slide and just asked for another one... The. I got my food and it was worse than my high school cafeteria one in el paso. This is not Mexican food... I even paid for my plate and didn t eat 1 4 of it. Everything was bad... Disappointed...
Taquerias Arandinas,54,I m going to preface this review by saying that for the four years i ve lived here i ve been a stupid gringo.  I went to Aranda s when i first moved here from Mississippi and was completely turned off by  brains  and  tongue  and stuck my nose up to the high heavens.  Well  years later i realized that i ve never gone back to any of these  hole in the wall  mexican places.  Man   I ve been missing out and it s my own fault.  I decided to pick up some dinner for my friend and I and this was cheap and i was craving something awesome   I picked up her a taco plate  2 tacos  rice and beans   5 and myself a california burrito  beef  rice  beans  sour cream  guacamole  lettuce  tomato  i think    5.  It was seriously  10 for those things.  That burrito was HUGE   It completely fell apart after having to use a fork and knife to eat it.  I can t wait to eat more food at this place   Oh yeah  the lady working the counter was beyond sweet.  She kept trying to offer me food and let me try their aguas frescas.  I now know i m not a fan of tamarindo.  Eww.
Taquerias Arandinas,55,What a surprise.  The outside and the location are quite lackluster.  When you walk in however it is clean and the staff is extra friendly.  I ordered a Quesadilla with carne asada beef.   It was very good.  The meat was very flavorful and it was full of cheese.  The 2 salsas were delicioso as well  one very fresh and the other was smokey and spicy.  Ill definately be back 
Tres Marias Tacos,1,Little food trailer in parking lot of gas station. I used Yelp s directions and it got me there with no trouble at all.  Very good tacos. Gorditas are even better. These are not like Taco Bells gorditas  these are the real deal  oh how i miss having gorditas. Not something you can find in my hometown. Enjoy it Austin    Their spicy salsa is HOT. They warned me but I love hot stuff so I loaded my tacos. Whoa  They weren t kidding. Glasses slipped right off my nose with my first bite. HOT STUFF  I kept on using it though. Very tasty but you have been warned. We ordered a large order ahead and it was ready when i got there. Cash is best as they did have some trouble with their card reader due to the wi-fi. Also I want to mention the women are very trustworthy. My card wasn t going through so I paid cash. She said she cancelled it. You can just tell by looking that they are humble  hardworking   amp  honest. Just a girl who loves Jesus  sunshine  Austin   amp  tacos.   Gorditas too  
Tres Marias Tacos,2,Went during the week to finally try this place out  and ordered the chorizo and egg taco  the Al pastor  and the a la Mexicana taco.  Thankfully no wait  so I got to talk to the lady a bit about what s popular  and although the corn tortillas are made in  house  the flour ones are not  didn t realize until after I had already ordered and she told me .  The chorizo and egg was mediocre. Definitely had way better so was disappointed with that.  The al pastor was definitely tasty and the only one I enjoyed.  The a La Mexicana was also rather bland and nothing to rave about.  All the tacos seem to be about  3.50ish each although I m not sure since they don t have any prices listed.
Tres Marias Tacos,3,First time stopping here. Pastor tacos were delicious. I will definitely be adding this to my list of  quick and yummy eats  stops on my way to work.
Tres Marias Tacos,4,Not worth  3.50 per breakfast taco. I don t mind spending money on good breakfast tacos but this is just an average  nothing special taco with lower quality ingredients. The establishment is a run down cash only trailer in a gas station parking lot. All of the the prices have been removed from the menu so when I was charged 20.00 for 6 tacos I was a bit thrown off. The migas taco had poorly scrambled eggs  corn chips and a little bit of budget cheese nothing else  was very bland  Potato egg cheese taco tasted low quality and bland  I canceled the bean and cheese tacos because I refuse to pay 7 dollars for beans and cheese on a taco shell.
Tres Marias Tacos,5,Outstanding tacos  Very friendly people and the portions are huge. I always order about 3-4 tacos at a taco truck but here one or two would probably suffice  I still buy 3-4 . The corn tortillas are made by hand and I m pretty sure the red salsa is too bc it s not like other trucks offer  it s smoky and hot.  I rarely write reviews but I feel like these women deserve the business  they definitely work hard for it in their little trailer.
Tres Marias Tacos,6,INCREDIBLE CARNITAS   We stopped at this tiny little taco stand for a quick bite before a road trip and it blew us away. The woman who served us was so kind and you could tell she puts love into her food. We got the carnitas  barbacoa  bean  amp  cheese  and migas tacos. All incredible. Can t recommend this place enough  It absolutely deserves more attention.
Tres Marias Tacos,7,This is an absolute hidden gem  If you want authentic tacos with homemade tortillas go here  We had the chicken fajita  barbacoa  pastor and carnitas tacos. The barbacoa literally melted apart. The pastor and chicken were our favorites  The salsas are nice and fresh and HOT  This place is incredibly great for the price as well.  3 taco  I ll be sad if it gets super busy but happy for them because they deserve it. Take visitors here  I took my east coast father and he loved them.
Tres Marias Tacos,8,Really good tacos  the best in the area  they take their time and do it right  I wish they d stay open a little later.
Tres Marias Tacos,9,Like others said  this place is a gem that deserves way more attention. I am vegetarian and even while not trying the meat tacos people rave about  I m an egg and bean breakfast taco 4life   I can say these are the best tacos I ve had in Austin. The key is the tortillas. Store bought tortillas mess with my stomach  and the Maria s make their own from scratch. Heaven in your belly. They put a lot of love in these.
Tres Marias Tacos,10,Oh my goodness  how have I not eaten from here before  We picked up some tacos yesterday. They were delicious. My mother in law got them  I think she said she just got their beef tacos. The beef was delicious  not ground beef almost like steak  the peppers were excellent  onions  the red salsa had a great kick  way spicy and the tortillas... I want to be wrapped in a blanket of those tortillas. The absolute best. Already thinking of taking a walk down there to get some more for today. Delicious. No photos because they were devoured.
Tres Marias Tacos,11,I should leave a review for this place so that they get some more business - they deserve it. They have the best carnitas in the entire state. One of the best things I ve had in Austin so far. I d eat here every day  but I d gain 50lbs in a month. So freaking good though  Go see Maria s . Now.
Tres Marias Tacos,12,This place is sooooooo good  Maria and her mom Elvira really care about the quality of their food. I asked her why she made tortillas if it was so much work and she said that the tortillas you buy in store have too many additives and you never know what you re getting but you do with these.   They make traditional Mexican food that you usually don t find in Austin. This place is super affordable. I told Maria that some places sell tacos for  5 and she couldn t believe it      This is a family owned business  you get to meet the person who put love and care into making your food and the green salsa is amazing. Don t miss the chance for some great tacos 
Tres Marias Tacos,13,I have to admit that I have only tried the Breakfast tacos  but they were excellent. I stopped there one day and went back the next morning because they were so good. They were on  homemade  tortillas packed full of eggs  potatoes  and cheese.  They make their own tortillas  and she said that they will sell them separately for you to take home.  Price tag great   2.00 for the egg tacos.
Tres Marias Tacos,14,This place hits the spot    My fave place to go to for breakfast tacos. Their Barbacoa tacos are chefs kiss   The lady is so nice there too. And the green salsa is amazing. My favorite local south Austin taco spot 
Tres Marias Tacos,15,This truck is run by the friendliest women imaginable. Always greeted with a smile and even a sample sometimes. The barbacoa tacos are great but the star of the show is the carnitas   Out. Of. This. World. And don t forget the salsa. Red and green and both spicy and super delicious. Best tacos in South Austin easy.
Tres Marias Tacos,16,Most authentic tacos is Austin  The green sauce is AMAZING   Forget Torchy s... we always make the drive to come to Tres Maria s  They have covered picnic tables which is nice and unexpected for a taco truck... even my kids love this place   
Tres Marias Tacos,17,Love the authentic breakfast tacos and homemade corn tortillas the best   Haven t tried the lunch options but most of the egg combos are really yummy and affordable  You can add on to your taco of choice too  my fave right now is migas with avocado or eggs  beans  potato  cheese and guac with either bacon or no meat  Everything is made to order and cards are accepted. The sweet ladies do a great job and give really great prices when compared to bigger name taco places or the ones with top reviews that end up being overrated. Be warned that the green salsa can get really spicy sometimes 
Tres Marias Tacos,18,These are some of the best tacos I have had since moving to Texas. I recommend this place to anyone I meet. Get the fajitas you will not be disappointed 
Cosmic Taco,1,This was my first time trying this food truck and let me tell you  they have the best tacos and quesadillas I ve ever had   I ordered the Veggie Quesadilla and the pastor tacos. They were so filling and tasted homemade  Will definitely be going here for any future taco cravings   
Cosmic Taco,2,Best tacos in town   If you re looking for some fresh ingredients and great flavor this is the place to go 
Cosmic Taco,3,It was a cold and the rain finally let up when I stumbled across this truck when my go to was closed...I really glad it was as I food some great tacos..Friendly service and some great food  ..I had the El Fuereno and the El Ranchero...both on flour...packed with fresh ingredients and oozing with flavor   ..sauces were the bomb  Great find for sure  
Cosmic Taco,4,These tacos are truly out of this world. Great flavors  fresh ingredients and plenty of options. I had the Pastor  Gringa  amp  the Fajita tacos. They have the standard corn or flour  but also a wheat tortilla option. A few people made comments on the pricing  but you can hit them up on Taco Tuesdays where all of their tacos are  2.50.
Cosmic Taco,5,They were open when no one else was but no place special.  They were perfectly fine tacos  but very Americanized.  I wouldn t waste a meal in Austin on them again.
Cosmic Taco,6,I love that they always serve fresh ingredients and have vegetarian options. They are located in a funky little food truck park that needs a little work  but I keep going back. They are super friendly and give discounts to healthcare workers. They make your food to order  so be prepared to wait. It s worth it.
Cosmic Taco,7,Great tacos  I had the barbacoa taco and it was yum  Will have to come back and try others.
Cosmic Taco,8,Found this little gem in a small food truck area. Amazing street tacos  They kept true to the ingredients and made to order as it should be. Great people and great service  We ll be back 
Cosmic Taco,9,Love the fresh ingredients and unique flavors. Definitely stands out on the Austin taco scene.
Cosmic Taco,10,Great tacos that are affordable and delicious  This is a food truck that is currently located on East 11th street where the food truck park is. The owners are really great and to won t be disappointed.
Cosmic Taco,11,I ordered 4 orders of their dish  Do a Cleo  it s not specific on their sign how many tacos it comes with. But it s about  4. So  I ordered 4 of those. The orders were for four people. Eventually  we were handed 2 trays holding tacos. My fianc  and ate as we waited for the other two orders to come out for my sister and my brother in law. Well we waited about 25 minutes. I had been standing in front of the food truck the entire time. Waiting for the other two orders. I was less than 2 feet from the window of the food truck. The two people working it kept looking at me but didn t open the window to ask me if I needed anything. So finally I asked how much longer  And they claimed they handed me 4 tacos already. They didn t know we were still waiting for food. So I clarified. I m waiting for my sister and my brother in laws orders. They said Nope we gave you four tacos. That s when I realized that the idiot handed me all four tacos on two trays. I assumed the dish came with two tacos. I ve never been anywhere else where they serve you everyone s food on one plate. That was the most frustrating thing. And they couldn t even claim they misunderstood. They asked every single one of us individually what kind of tortillas we wanted. They messed up and never bothered to ask me what I needed when they saw me standing there s so no recommend. TO ANYONE
Cosmic Taco,12,In a town brimming with taco joints it s hard to get a meh taco.  The pastor  a beloved favorite was not exciting.  My friend got one as well and didn t love it.  Mt second taco   la gringa was better   cheese has a way of making everything better though  doesn t it  The chips were stale   but the salsa was fine.  The tomatillo needed something   it was just not great.   The cucumber agua fresca was delightful and the guy at the counter was very pleasant.
Cosmic Taco,13,This place is awesome  Great breakfast tacos and regular tacos. The service is great  vibe is really funky divey - it s located in a food truck park.   I got the breakfast taco with bacon  awesome  and the gringo al pastor  AMAZING . Their flour tortillas were crispy but soft inside  and they also put melted cheese on the inside.   Also don t miss their agua frescas - we did half pineapple mango and half guava and it was delicious.
Cosmic Taco,14,As far as inexpensive tacos go these are among the best I ve had. I got the El Fuerte and the El Enchilado breakfast tacos. The El Fuerte was refreshing and clean while the El Enchilado was spicy and bold  The size of the tacos we re perfect and the environment at Vic grill is great   Two tasty bfast tacos a topo Chico and a  1 tip came out to  9.something. ya can t beat that imo
Cosmic Taco,15,They do a great job here and there customer service is spot on with plenty of smiles     Love the ambiance of community at Kenny Dorhams backyard 
Cosmic Taco,16,Wow  I am impressed and surprised by this place. It has a pretty good ranges of menu items  all tacos of course  and everything I tried was pretty good quality. Sitting next to Thai Kruefha and Wasota this place has some stiff competition for food  but really stands out.  The tortillas they use are excellent and the salsas are fantastic as well. Then you get to inside of the tacos and they are pretty well thought out.  My migas taco changed it up a little with spicier peppers than the typical bell peppers you find around town  but it was pretty well balanced 
Cosmic Taco,17,After eating tacos for a week straight in Austin trying all the supposed  best tacos in Austin  nothing beat Cosmic Taco. The breakfast tacos are to die for and I miss them already
Cosmic Taco,18,Had some excellent street tacos and a coke. First time in Austin and the food has not disappointed. The atmosphere at this food truck location is superb.
Cosmic Taco,19,These are the best tacos I ve ever had  and I ve had a lot of tacos. We enjoyed the Al Pastor the most and the ambiance and location is unpretentious.
Cosmic Taco,20,Delicious   I had 2 breakfast tacos  migas  amp  el ranchero  and an el tate. I m stuffed. They were so good and I can t wait to come back 
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,1,First time here and not disappointed   Absolutely amazing  and portions are huge   Best tacos I have had in a while 
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,2,This is my spot. Everything rules. It s open late  there might be a band  maybe a guy selling candy. Get a pombazo and change your life.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,3,They were open at 1am on Christmas and after bar hopping downtown it was nice to have some delicious tacos. Everyone working was cool and helpful. The food was fast  they also serve beer so my friend was happy.  I tried two suadero tacos on flour. Warning  their sauces are pretty spicy. I inhaled these so fast that I then ordered two chicken tacos on flour and tried their pineapple agua these were also good and the pineapple water was amazing  I drank it the next day when all the ice melted and it was still really flavorful. I will definitely be back even if it is just late night munchies  they actually marinate their meat and you will taste the difference. They also served both sets of tacos with cucumber which was refreshing after trying the verde sauce.  Note  they do accept plastic payment now.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,4,This place is such a vibe with the live music  Los De Taqueria 7 Estrellas has such good style and good music   We tried the torta Cuban and it delicious the best one I ve tried so far it s unique in its own way  . My bf has  been coming here since he s been a kid so he knows a secret menu item  and it s the best quesadillas I ve had   We also tried the Birria tacos which the owner was kind enough to give us for free and they were delicious and crispy just how I like them    The best birria I ve tasted in town . I 10000  recommend this place   It s my go too after a nice night out it always hits the spot
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,5,Best mexican street tacos in Texas    Must get the al pastor tacos  tostada and definitely get the bacon wrapped jalapeno with green onions. This is our go to place for late noght food
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,6,Sanitation should closed that place  we wait long very expensive   63 for 3 orders and there were roaches n flyers around the table very disgusting
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,7,Don t let this unassuming taco trailer in front of a tire shop sway your judgment. 7 Estrellas has the best Al Pastor taco I ve ever consumed. This is a late night taco truck  their hours are 8pm to 4am during the week or until 5am during the weekend  I ve heard that there are sometimes people playing instruments and making this quite the hangout.   Along with the al pastor  we also tried the carnitas  which was a little on the drier side  but they have incredible red and green sauces in the fridge in front of the truck. The drinks were a bit warm since we showed up right at opening time  but since I was drinking water  I didn t mind this at all. Not only are these tacos delicious  but they re wonderfully priced. We bought four tacos  a bacon wrapped  cheese stuffed jalapeno  a coke and a water and only paid  16.    What to Order  Al Pastor Taco  Bistec Taco Pros      Price  Pastor  Late Night  Authentic  Awesome Customer Service Cons  -   Only Late Night Hours  Oily Tortillas  Only Outside Seating
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,8,The food was over priced  has no sessioning  meet is very chewy  drinks are ass and water down. Pastor had no pineapple 2nd location is dog shit
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,9,Went here w a group   we all felt nauseous and our stomach hurt right after legit almost threw up . The food was horrible too for the price . Restaurant price for bad food .
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,10,Nice people but shitty food. 2nd location was A BIG FAIL . strawberry horchata was watered down. Tacos were flavorless only thing that had any flavor was the pineapple  and even that I only got 1 piece of pineapple. I feel lied to and deceived. Also paid 53 dollars for 7 tacos. Nice people but tacos were MID at most. Disappointed . Should ve followed the signs I was given. No one was here at 1am which is you re dead giveaway. It s bad
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,21,it was alright. there was more cilantro than meat. chile was basically water.  agua fresca  was not  fresca   it was straight water.  there s no listing of the prices and it came out to  18 a plate.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,22,Be careful of a place that doesn t post prices  the amount you pay depends on the color of your skin. I remember going previously late night and thinking the prices were high. Tonight they tried to charge me  20 for four tacos and a sope. I don t think so   After sitting down to wait I returned to ask how much a taco cost.  3 was the answer. A sope   4. She then began to explain that since I had wanted  con todo  she had charged m an additional  4. For onions and cilantro  Really  I don t know of any other taqueria in the world that charges for cilantro and onions. Her and the cook began stammering about a bacon-wrapped pepper that the cook was suddenly putting on the plate to pretend that was the justification for the higher price. Bullshit. I took back my  20 and went down the street to Tacorrido for a pound of carnitas for  16.  THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,23,The food was ok. Authentic taco stand open late night for people getting out of bars clubs  but I wish that there was more information about the food options pricing. Most of the menu was in Spanish and didn t know that the pepper wrapped with bacon is an additional price. Had the strawberry horchata and didn t like it  thought it was too sweet. Overall it s ok for what you pay for at that hour
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,24,The bottom line is there s a whole world of late night taco stands  amp  taquerias out there  they re cheap  amp  good eats  and you re going to be the goofy Anglo guy named Dave unless you speak Spanish or go with a pro. I went with a pro.   I know my way around breakfast tacos  but I don t know Jack Cabeza about the real stuff. I liked the pineapple here  the corn tortillas were good  and the green sauce kicks nicely. I m just slightly apprehensive working with homemade sauces in squeeze bottles that are sitting around outside on tables. It s a Dave thing.   Given a choice  I d rather have bistek chunks instead of cubes  it s easier for me to focus on their taste. But having said that  two solid tacos for a flat four bucks outside on   beautiful late night Saturday  Yeah  I ll come along.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,25,Great food  cheap  fast. What more could I ask for  The person who took my order was very patient with me  and the food was very good. It was even good reheated the day after.   I got sincronizada with a bacon wrapped jalepeno  and a gordita  setting me back  10. I think that s on-par for Austin s relatively more expensive tacos.   Cash only when I visited. Be aware.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,26,After stopping at 5 different place  been close   we end up at this truck taco place   We hand a great experience the Tacos al pastor are super good and the Gorditas are awesome   I ll be coming back again.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,27,Really authentic Mexican street food and tacos. Absolutely delicious. Open super late  food truck style but with ample seating. Add a corn on the cob or bacon wrapped cheese stuffed jalape o to your order.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,28,A couple bad salsa days   too many in my book. I didn t even know salsa could go bad prior to these two occasions. On top of that  they re pretty stingy when it comes to extra salsa containers. If you re like me  two of those tiny thing is barely enough salsa for three tacos. You just gotta be upfront and ask for more if you re taking it to-go  even if they seem outwardly stingy. Yes  they ll sometimes hold back and act like they don t know what you re asking for and make you feel totally awkward even though you ve asked for extra salsa every time you come. The wait just seems to get exponentially longer...which may be a good thing for them. If you come at 10-12 at night  expect a 35-45 minute wait time for 3 tacos.  Recently  I ve found another taco joint that fulfills all my needs in terms of competitive prices  authentic taste  unlimited-always-fresh salsa  convenience and efficiency. So  I had to come back to this review and take off a couple stars to be more accurate in my rating for the new joint. It s been real  Taquerias Estrellas. But it s definitely a you thing  not a me thing.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,29,I ve got a new friend in Taqueria 7  aka Taqueria Siete Estrellas  aka Taqueria Seven Stars  aka  Taqueria Why The Heck Haven t We Come Here Before        .  On a Tuesday evening at the Draughthouse with Tony B.  we discussed this little taco trailer.  We both independently tried to stop by on our way back north.  Going there is old hat to Tony  who loves munching on some  face   Cabeza de Res   Head of Cow .  Well  Tuesday is their day off.  So we were out of luck.  But otherwise  they open at around 7pm and stay open  till 3amish   putting out some pretty righteous Mexican streetfood.  The  al pastor  is the real deal.  That apparently will be wife s go to taco.  The  face  was roast beef-esque  in a good way .  And for some reason  though I usually try and avoid cilantro  yeah  sue me  everything we sampled was enhanced by a squeeze of lime  and cilantro.  The green salsa was fresh and provided a flavorful burn  in the small quantities we  gringos  applied  we still need to try the red .  And the torta cubana.... wow.   Cheesy meaty awesomeness. Soo many more things to try  sopes  tortas  enchiladas  etc.  And the kind lady at the window is very patient with us and has a great smile.   Taqueria 7 does it s thing  and does it well.  We went last night for my  birthday dinner   when there were plenty of hipsterdoddy burgers  or plates covered with uchi we could have sampled instead.  But it was soothing to sit in this little tire shop parking lot on foldy chairs after dark  not worrying about a 2  hour wait in a line  or whether my service would be affected by what I was wearing  or that my tab would exceed my college apartment s monthly rent.  We splurged  and got Mexican Cokes  and ran up a huge  13 tab.     When we want to get away from the hustly-bustledness of life  and can t take the time to head to Isla Mujeres and dip our toes in the ocean while sipping on a Jarritos  we ll do the next best thing and head to Taqueria Siete Estrellas.  PS  Previous  and only sub-4   reviewer  Those aren t  freshly cut beats   I like to sing Kanye s freshly cut beats.  They re dope  yo. . They are radishes.  PPS Not the easiest place to find.  See my  Tip  if you re having trouble.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,30,This place is great. Fantastic pastor and it s always a party after midnight  Love that they give you onions on the plate and they are very generous with the portions. A really authentic and fantastic spot.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,31,I LOVE LOVE LOVE Their Tacos    They are AMAZING   It s like heaven on earth in my mouthI can honestly say this is the best taco spot up in north Austin. The workers are beautiful and very kindly people and the tacos are so worth the drive  If you haven t tried their tacos than you need to...like NOW  They stay open passed 2am so go get you some delicious tacos specially some pastor 
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,32,I liked this place  the tacos were pretty good I also really liked the bacon wrapped jalape o. It s open late and despite being Saturday night and being busy I got my food pretty quickly. They have a lot of seating for the people wanting to grab a bite and eat there. The taco truck is covered in lights so when driving by you really can t miss it  If you like food trucks or taco stands you should stop by this one and give it a shot  I can totally see myself going back 
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,33,Growing up in Mexico I ve come to know what true good taquitos taste like. My bf and I were very excited to try this spot. Unfortunately she missed the mark. WARNING - if they ask you if you d like Chile and cebolla  they mean as an extra charge. The bacon wrapped  amp  stuffed cheese chiles are  3 each and the cebolla Is  1. That adds up quick   Ok so we got some Al pastor  amp  bistec tacos AND gorditas with bistec pastor and asada. The flavor was not there yall. The meat lacked seasoning and proper cooking in its own juices and ultimately that slight crispiness you expect from well cooked meat. The gorditas were ok   mainly due to the very oily gordita maza. Also there s no pricing for anything listed anywhere. But trust she s not I m the budget friendly side of street tacos. Ultimately she s basic confusing over priced and lacks that flavor. But the staff is nice. Also the salsa are not spicy
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,34,I don t know about you  but after a few beers...nothing hits the spot like a couple face tacos...  Yes  I said face tacos. OK...so technically Cabeza de rez. That would be cow head to the rest of you. Lovingly slow cooked until buttery  served on corn tortillas with shredded cabbage  cilantro  and cucumbers. The succulent meat was well seasoned and potentially habit forming. Once these hit the table...all stimulating conversation came to an abrupt halt...  Now...being the eating machine I am  I also ordered up a Torta Cubana. A crusty roll gave way to a soft interior overflowing with spicy chorizo  grilled ham  avocado  tomato  lettuce  and a hot dog. HOT DOG     Oh yeah baby...a grilled split hot dog was nestled in the midst of this delectably messy sandwich. Force meat tube steak. Love sausage. Bologna cylinder. This sandwich could easily take the centerfold in any food porn mag...  The menu was a list of all sorts of happy foods...pastor  tripas  bistek  and a variety of torta selections. Massive tubs of horchata and agua fresca were also present.   If you find yourself driving up N Lamar in the Rundberg area  be sure to keep an eye open for this festive trailer and tent. I guarantee you will not be sorry you stopped 
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,35,This place had the feel of my favorite place back in dallas. But couldn t live up to it at all.... sad. Got 4 different tacos.  Bistec  the traditional in my book  was on the bland side  but the meat was really tender. Al pastor was good  was grilled really crispy which is a plus. Chicken fajita was bland  but tender  was a bit weird cause it tasted like they were just cooked in liquid.Beef fajita was cooked well  lacked seasoning as well.... This place didn t do onions  but cabbage and cilantro instead  and a side of freshly cut beats. Was interesting.. beats served as a pallet cleanser I m guessing.   Solid 3 stars
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,36,I ve heard read great things about 7 Estrellas  stopped by on whim a few nights ago.  I was surprised at how expensive it is   19 for 2 tacos  enchiladas  and a soda. Way too much .. I can handle  2 taco  even if a tad skimpy. Enchiladas were mediocre at best - too much tortilla  not enough filling - and way too expensive   Also difficult to place order  hear them  due to tv volume so loud  it s near window .  I ll give it 2.5 stars and willing to try one more time.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,37,Do you like bacon  My tacos came with a stuffed jalapeno wrapped in bacon. I would say that was the star of the show and why it earned the fourth star.  I showed up Friday night around 2 30 am and order two cabeza de res   I was told this is barbacoa   two Suadero  beef   and an Agua Pina.   The plate had everything I could have wanted. It had bacon  cilantro  a grilled green onion  radish  and of course the tacos. It was beautiful. While I did enjoy the food  I couldn t help but feel something was wrong. Maybe it was because the four tacos set me back 11 bucks  2.75 a taco  I m not sure because prices were not written anywhere. The tortillas were corn  I usually get flour  I wasn t offer the choice. The barbacoa was not the slow cooked oily mess I was use to. All tacos tasted good  nothing spectacular  just good.The agua pina had a strange texture about it that I can t describe. It tasted good but again  something about it wasn t right.   The only time I see myself returning is if I wanted the beautiful Taqueria 7 Estrellas brand of tacos or if I wanted tacos really bad really late. Otherwise  for the price  there are plenty of other taco spots.   WARNING  The parking lot entrance is big enough for one car only. Please be careful entering the lot especially if you re making a left.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,38,Food is amazing... The gorditas are to die for ... Tacos are also delicious. Great experience... Service could be a little better but that s what u expect at a taco stand
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,39,CAUTION  I ate here with my partner and the food seemed to be fine. I also ordered an horchata  which was given with delay and tasted different - but kinda good. I waited forever for my food and didn t want to complain about the funny tasting agua fresca. I was trying to be nice. It tasted like agua de melon was kinda mixed in there. About 24 hours later  I became INCREDIBLY sick. I woke up covered in sweat  chills  fever  and a bout of irregularity. I could hardly walk and didn t wanna talk. I didn t want to do anything but sleep for a couple of days. As it stands  the lab is still testing for what I have  but they believe it to be e. Coli  Salmonella  or the like. It s been a week and I still struggle to go about my daily life  and I m taking everything I can to feel normal again. My partner and I mostly eat home cooked meals and that was our diet for the in-between time in dining here. I will never return again  and won t recommend this place to anyone. Even if I didn t get sick on the food  I still don t trust the cleanliness of this place.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,40,One line summary - good food  just make sure to clarify what you re ordering  The tacos were great  but the menu was confusing. Everything was listed in one column  so we assumed they were all tacos. After ordering  I got 4 tacos and 4 tortas. Way too much for me to eat  but the food was pretty decent.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,41,This taqueria trailer is located in the parking lot of the yellow-signed La Chica Tienda convenience store on the corner of Gault and Anderson.  Walk to the window with  3 and say  dos pastor   Walk away with two of the best tacos al pastor you ve ever had and a smile.   not sure about their hours... I ve only tried dinner and late-night    update - posted approximate hours and learned that they make their own corn tortillas 
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,42,Absolutely Loved the food   Authentic indeed  We were hungry so didn t have time to take a picture. Even though we might have mixed our plates the food was delicious  We ordered tacos  amp  it came with grilled sweet onions and jalape o wrapped in bacon. I had a agua fresca horchata  never had it before. The drink was alright and then something I needed after every bite. Over all we were all very pleased and left wanting more. Definitely recommend this place. We ve been coming to Austin for years and surprised we re just now coming to it. Definitely better then Taco Cabana. We give you 10 stars   LOVED LOVED  LOVED  THE TACOS   We re definitely Coming back 
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,43,After working another 12 hour day yesterday  I was not in the mood to drive far for dinner. It was a little after 11pm  and my brother and I were just going to grab some Taco Cabana.  Luckily  I remembered Don P. s Review on this little taco stand  and we decided to try it out. Thank you Don  if you had not reviewed this place  I probably would have never stopped by.  When we walked up  it was obvious that the owner did not speak English  and I know how to say like 5 things in Spanish. So  seeing that we were having trouble deciding what do get  the owner called his daughter over.  She was awesome. I asked her what her favorite was  and after a slight pause  she said  All  I like all of them . We talked for a little while  asking what part of Mexico her family is from  and how long they have lived here  etc. The family is from Mexico City  they ve been here for 9 years  and she is one of 7 children. She said she could be home right now  doing laundry or cleaning. But she would rather be working. She wants to go to culinary school and become a chef. And if she can cook anything like her father can  she will do very well.   Per Don s recommendation we ordered three al pastor  which were yummmmazing. We also ordered three cabeza de res. Head meat delicious. And three bistek  which were good  but a little chewy.  She told us we could order one more to get the special 10 tacos for  15. We asked which one she thought we should try and she said  The guts  get the guts . So we did  and she asked if we wanted it   Well done. You know  kind of crispy . Sure  why not  I have never had tripe before  but it was surprisingly good. But next time  I think I will stick with the al pastor.   What makes this place special is the devotion you see to making good food. It s a taco stand  but this family really cares about the food they are making. The meat is prepared well  the sauces are amazing. And they use cabbage instead of onions  which the daughter sounded really proud of. She said It s what makes us special  everyone else puts onions and cilantro on their tacos  but we put cabbage and cilantro  it s really good.  I can only agree  it was very good.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,44,Cheap tacos in Austin. Yes  I said it. Dirty  Yes. But that is okay
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,45,Decided to try them out  should of gone somewhere else. Got carnitas  cabeza de res cow head  and pastor. The pastor was ok  the carnitas were bland and dry  and the cow head was not good at all  too dry  since I ve had better. My husband got tripas taco  you couldn t  even tell it was a tripas taco by looking at it. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because of the cheese filled  bacon wrapped jalape o. Also  24 for 8 tacos seemed kinda a little pricey since I ve bought more at other taquerias for that  price and better tacos. But all in all  won t ever go back there again. There s way better taquerias out there.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,46,This place is nothing short of spectacular. The food is as authentic as can get  and delicious  too. The food is also priced well. While every item is phenomenal  except the horchata   the franchise player is the gordita. This is an absolutely must try. I get it with cesina and it never disappoints. Do yourself a favor and go out there to try it. You won t be disappointed.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,47,Love the Al Pastor tacos. They are prepared w o pineapple  which is unusual but delicious nonetheless. The fajita chicken is also very tasty in Gorditas. So good I keep going back even though the hours and lack of card payment acceptance are inconveniences. Definitely recommend you bring enough cash when you check it out. Dinner for 2 abt  20 bucks.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,48,al pastor with the pineapple on top  im halfway sold already. Oh  the torte cubana comes with a deep fired hot dog on it  Tell me no more....
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,49,I don t write reviews unless the place surprises me in a great way or the place blows and I threw the food away. This place exceeded my expectations. Love the fajita tacos. They don t speak a lick of English though  which makes it difficult to order exactly what you want. Most of the time I have no clue what I m eating  but it tastes great.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,50,We actually stumbled upon this little gem while looking for another restaurant that served al pastor. Turns out the other restaurant had closed down but I considered it a sign from God that after driving across town for al pastor the one parking lot we stopped in for directions happened to contain an al pastor trailer. My girlfriend is not terribly adventurous when it comes to trailer food but I persuaded her to at least try one taco and if she didn t like it we could go somewhere else. After one bite I was back out of the car and purchasing 6 more tacos.   That was last week and we went back this weekend too. I have lived in Mexico and have eaten a lot of great street food and this is up there with any of it. Definitely worth a try. The other tacos are pretty good but the al pastor is definitely their specialty.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,51,It was very late  night and since I m on a trailer tasting adventure I decided to yelp the taquerias that we re open at midnight. I refused to drive dt and deal with drunken people. Ii drove down n.Lamar and saw what yelp said was still open. The place was poppin  a good sign of great Mexican food is when you see lots of Latinos waiting for food and only speak Spanish. You also see just one white man trying to get some food  good food that is.The aguas frescas are ok  the horchata needs more condensed milk but it s still good. I would suggest the gorditas  any meat. The tacos al pastor are great  and the salsas spectacular. I m sad that didnt find this place sooner but will stop by when ever its feasible. Very authentic mexico city tacos  for sure....
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,52,The el pastor was very good and the barbacoa was solid also. It was pretty great to hear a two-person Mariachi band playing for just a few people at 10 30 on a Sunday night. I will eat their again soon.
Taqueria 7 Estrellas,53,if you ve driven north lamar at night  you ve probably seen this place lit up like a christmas tree in front of a used tire yard. anthony bourdain would make some quip about how the proximity to blue collar work guarantees good flavor but i m not him. to make a long story short  everything is at least pretty good  and quite a few things are amazing. i ve been craving good tortas since I came back to the states from mexico  and they make a greasy  delicious torta cubana with perfect bread and everything.  even though i m pretty sure mine had a oscar mayer weiner in it  i loved it. and the gorditas  i didn t even know what an authentic gordita looked like  brainwashed as i am by taco bell commercials of my youth  but i was feeling frisky and i ordered one and i loved that too. this is a SPOT
La Sabroza,1,Very good Lowkey spot definitely recommend if you are in a rush other than that quality is on point
La Sabroza,2,Tacos here are great  I would say the torta was fairly dry and flavorless. The Al pastor could use more flavor compared to other spots I ve tried.
La Sabroza,3,29 dollars for 2 quesadillas and a bistec torta all for it to be tasteless. No idea how this place has good reviews. This place aint it and especially for what you re paying. Even the salsa was cheeks
La Sabroza,4,So so so good  Carnitas tacos and a bistec quesadilla. Both meats were cooked and seasoned perfectly
La Sabroza,5,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this food for being a small truck. I ordered the al pastor torta and it was cooked to perfection. I also ordered the tacos which were only  2 each. The tacos I ordered were carnitas  al pastor  and carne asada on a corn tortilla. I moved from LA where we have taco trucks everywhere and this truck is definitely high up on my list. It is opened late too  so if you have a fun night out and want a late night meal definitely check this place out. This place is cash only so keep that in mind when visiting.
La Sabroza,6,By far my favorite place to get Pastor tacos in Austin. A lot of taco truck s Al Pastor meat is dry and I have to soak it in salsa and lime but even that doesn t do anything. With these  they there are melt in your mouth even without the salsa and lime  you know it s good when there s grease falling down off of the tacos lol . I ll miss this taco truck when I move back home to Dallas
La Sabroza,7,As a Hispanic from Houston  I know what a good taco tastes like. Let me just say these are by far the best ones I ve had after living here in Austin for 3 years. I don t know what took so long to find this place but I m so happy   I ordered the bistec and al pastor tacos. Really good meat and flavor for the price  Will definitely make this my go to  CASH ONLY
La Sabroza,8,Definitely not what I expected people I know all say this place is soooooo gooood so I was disappointed to get dry meat in my tacos I ordered. While ordering I saw store bought tortillas and just knew I wasn t going to like it guess I m just a snob like that. Over all the food was good but not worth the price I ve had better.
La Sabroza,9,I touched down in Austin with about three hours to burn  and I decided then and there that I would spend those hours visiting three of the highest rated taco spots in East Austin before writing a three way heads up review  so let s get this party started.  Tacos Guerrero vs. Granny s Tacos vs. La Sabroza  Star 1  How were the service and atmosphere   All three of these taco spots were trucks  with Tacos Guerrero being the largest and Granny s Tacos the smallest. That s not really relevant as all three spots also had nearby picnic tables for local diners  but I thought it was interesting nonetheless that all three were dealing with the same kitchen parameters within which to whip up their wares. Granny s took the cake as far as a quaint atmosphere went with a super friendly server to boot  but all three of these spots were perfectly fine.   Tacos Guerrero  Star  1  Granny s Tacos  Star  1  La Sabroza  Star  1   Star 2  How were the portions relative to the cost   When the heck did street tacos in Austin become so much more expensive than LA  To be fair these are larger tacos  but I was pretty surprised at paying between  2.00 and  3.00 for a single taco. The prices shook out per the below  and La Sabroza had notably smaller tacos compared to the competition   Tacos Guerrero   2.00 for breakfast   2.50 for lunch Granny s Tacos   3.00 for lunch La Sabroza   2.00 for lunch  Granny s were more expensive  but they ended up being the largest  and the best.  Tacos Guerrero  Star  2  Granny s Tacos  Star  2  La Sabroza  Star  2   Stars 3 and 4  How was the food   It s here that the grown-ups separated themselves from the children if you will. La Sabroza had some pretty weak offerings in my mind  with mediocre meats  asada had very little taste  that were slightly overcooked. Tacos Guerrero had good tacos for both breakfast and lunch with ingredients that were nice and cooked together  but both fell woefully short of Granny s  which were exceptional.   My pastor lunch taco at Granny s was marvelous  with a fresh lightly toasted tortilla  wonderfully flavorful pastor  and some nice peripherals like freshly chopped cilantro and just a smidge of pico that brought everything together with their excellent salsas. Wonderful.  Tacos Guerrero  Single Star  3  Granny s Tacos  Two Stars  4  La Sabroza  No Stars  2   Star 5  Would you eat here every day if you could   Granny s  Yes. La Sabroza or Tacos Guerrero  Not so much.  Tacos Guerrero  No Star  3  Granny s Tacos  Star  5  La Sabroza  No Star  2 
La Sabroza,10,I m from the valley 956   and this place is legit. For sure one of the best spots I ve tried here in Austin and the best in Riverside. I had the Gordita de bistek and it smacked. I also tried their breakfast tacos. I had one papa con huevo and one frijoles con queso. SO GOOD    
La Sabroza,11,So happy I found this place    Carnitas are the best ones in my opinion. Tacos are street taco size and delicious. Definitely will be coming back here.
La Sabroza,12,This taco stand is amazing  My husband and I are trying many taco stands for this month  and La Sabroza was easily one of the top places. The flavor was bold and the size of the tacos was perfect. Very cheap in price  and the selection was good. I had the al pastor and the carnitas - both very good
La Sabroza,13,My favorite is the  tacos gorditas   champechanas steak chorizo and monterrey jack queso   VERY GOOD I definitely recommend it to any one don t forget to ask for the red sauce
La Sabroza,14,I ve eaten my fair share of tacos in Austin aka Tacoville.  I have to say that La Sabroza is easily my favorite one.  I ve tried Al Pastor tacos all over town  but man...it s on another level here.  Super bold flavors and straight to the point.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.
La Sabroza,15,one of my favorite taco trucks in atx  really nice ladies  they remember my usual order. i loveeee their corn tortillas. the gorditas and quesadillas are good too. the quesadillas come in a softer  fluffy bread. gorditas are the crispy kind.
La Sabroza,16,If I were to rate the things I order yesterday  I give the campechana quesadilla a 2 5. The filling was ok and the flour tortilla was terrible. It was like that tortilla that you get from Taco Bell. If anyone knows what a campechana is  you know the flour tortilla makes it or breaks it. The gordita was a 5 5. Crunchy and lots of filling  The torta was a 4 5  nothing compared to the gordita. The horchata was a 4 5.
La Sabroza,17,This place is perfect  Everything was incredible especially the pastor tacos... Super affordable as well and definitely worth visiting.
La Sabroza,18,the tortillas are beyond my wildest expectations.  these tacos are perfect.
La Sabroza,19,I am addicted to there chicken fajita tacos. I get them with avocado  cheese  cilantro  and grilled onions and bell peppers. SO GOOD  It wouldn t be them same without their avocado salsa they have. Not too spicy but I like the heat. My bf likes and I also like their gorditas. They are as big as a plate. They come with lettuce  tomato  cheese  avo  jalapenos.. so good but they crumble easily. I just eat it with a fork after that  super good food though. Price is good. Got a gordita and 4 tacos for  9 one night. I recommend this place to everyone. I always bring cash..not sure if they take credit cards.
La Sabroza,20,Big and delicious gorditas  they tip them w beans cheese  lettuce  tomatoes and avacado  only  5. Not bad for a decent price.
La Sabroza,21,I m from a border town called Brownsville  if anyone knows tacos it s any Brownsvillian. Now  Austin has its fair share of so called  tacos  but let me tell you  La Sabroza is always on point   Their Campechanos have awesomeness written all over them   it s bistek  melted cheese  chorizo  onion and cilantro. If you re  passing this little red truck  it s a must try 
Greens 'n Grill,1,Tried this food truck with my son and granddaughter. They have something for everyone  tacos  bowls  hot dogs  Mexican ice cream bars  etc.  We had Barbacoa  Steak and Al Pastor tacos. My granddaughter had the kiddie plate with fruit  chips and hotdog. The beef was very flavorful and tender  it was a very good cut of meat. My granddaughter enjoyed the ice cream bar  as well.  Service was great. Parking garage was close. I will definitely return.
Greens 'n Grill,2,My favorite thing about this food truck was how friendly the staff were. And the food was also phenomenal. I got the portobello bowl and the mushrooms were cooked and flavored perfectly  the rice and beans were a perfect addition and the man who took my order recommended a mild salsa that paired great with the pico de gallo  avocado crema  and cheese. Easy two meals out of it  which I love. They also have mushroom tacos that I will have to try next time  Beautiful setting at the domain and they have their own shaded outdoor seating.
Greens 'n Grill,3,We like the vibe here and veggie options. It s fun and sunny at the Domain with play scapes  longhorn and lighted frogs   and lounge chairs near by. The owner was very nice and he made sure we can customize our order. The horchata tasted freshly grounds of rice and lightly cinnamon. Packaging was plastic  styrofoam  and plastic bags with  Mild-Tomatillo  garlic  cilantro  light jalape o  Medium or Hot  Tomatillo  garlic  habanero pepper  I didn t tasted the Tomato based salsa  but the ones I tasted are not extremly spicy but very smooth and great. The Veggie Grill Portabello Mushroom   thickly sliced-grilled to tender and juicy  Bowl   steamed white rice with black beans made a creamy avocado  bite  can be made vegan by  removing sour cream and queso fresco or what I did have it  on the side and giving it to my son and husband who ordered the Pico Hot Dogs.   I did not taste but saw  The Pico Hot Dogs was a split and grilled hot dog that comes with French s ketchup  mustard  and Mayo packs  bacon chunks  chopped white onions  chopped tomatoes- so it tasted better according to him with sour cream and ketchup. The breading can be soggy if not eaten immediately. I like to support the local business  many veggie options many drinks and food options that can be customizable.
Greens 'n Grill,4,Arrived in Austin and found ourselves at the  Domain shopping area  before going to hotel.  We found a food truck titled   Greens  n Grill  next to a very lively area with many people and families having a great time.  The owners  Franciso and Mary  were very friendly  welcoming  and willing to accommodate us in deciding which of the may delicious meals to choose from on the menu.  Started with chips and salsa  added a portobello taco  beef taco  and citrus chicken bowl.  Every item was well presented and flavorful.  Concluded our wonderful meal with refreshingly cool popsicles.  The only difficulty was deciding which food to order and which of the many flavors of natural popsicles to choose.  P.S.  The fresh kiwi-strawberry was fresh coconut cream were our favorites.  Will certainly return to the outstanding establishment known by many locals as the  delicious Greens n  Grill
Greens 'n Grill,5,We had an early dinner here around 4 30 on Saturday--it wasn t our first choice  but the food truck that we had wanted to try was closed  thanks for not updating your hours on Google  jerks  . We wish that we had positive things to say about Greens n  Grill because it seems like a nice mom-n-pop operation  and the woman who was working was friendly  but the food...just awful.  Our daughter got a regular hot dog  which was fine  whatever  we weren t expecting fireworks  but pretty much everything here is made like it comes straight out of a Costco or HEB bag. Stale tortilla chips with bland and watery salsa  so gross. The Carne Asada salad  Unseasoned canned corn and black beans with pre-made pico and processed cheese. The meat was chewy and had no flavor. The chicken torta and the el pastor taco were better  but still  not particularly appetizing.   What you ll find here is value. Prices were reasonable--but as they say  you get what you pay for.
Greens 'n Grill,6,I liked tacos very much. They were very filling and delicious. The ice creams are sooo yummy too
Greens 'n Grill,7,Everything I ve seen come out of this truck looks fresh and delicious. A rare gem that has quick  healthy  yummy  affordable options. Something for everyone in the family during an event  or just someone that needs something quick on a lunch break.  Staff is friendly and caring. Facility is new  clean  and well maintained. I will definitely be back
Greens 'n Grill,8,The Bowls  fresh baked scones  very friendly everything was GREaT  I will be returning  Also try a fruit     paleta   All sooooo Yummy  Atmosphere here right now is nice  cool windy just a place to relax and read a book as well under the sun or under the tent provided.
Greens 'n Grill,9,This place is delicious  Super great  yummy  healthy food and the women are the nicest people you will ever meet. I recommend the steak bowl with their hot sauce 
Greens 'n Grill,10,These bowls are unbelievable. I had the chicken bowl which was deliciously seasoned and very generously portioned. Love the black beans and fresh made guacamole. All combined it made an extremely filling meal. Fantastic price for so much goodness to eat. My teenage daughter and friend loved it too  and you know how picky teens can be. One other thing I have to mention...SCONES    OMG  they make these things on site and they are just melt in your mouth delicious. The perfect texture and blend of sweet and savory with fruit and nuts  just incredible. If you are ever in the area  do yourself a favor and check this place out.
Greens 'n Grill,11,I travel monthly for business from California to Austin.  On a visit to the Domain  I found Greens  n Grill   This place provides very authentic food and it s  prepared fresh daily.  I have eaten here three times because the carne asada bowls are delicious.  The BBQ carne is very tender and flavorful.  On another occasion I tried the citrus chicken salad and I loved it as well.  I will definitely comeback to try the weekend specials.  One of those specials is sopes which is a special and authentic Mexican dish.  The food is organic and very clean.  In addition the staff is friendly and accommodating.
Greens 'n Grill,12,Super clean.   That food was delicious and the portions are perfect.   They have that green creamy sauce that I wish they sell to go     I truly recommend this place
Greens 'n Grill,13,The food is a mix between delicious and healthy  The scones were so delicious  Owners are so attentive and put a lot of love and care into their food  Will definitely be back.
Greens 'n Grill,14,This is probably one of my top favorite food trucks  I eat here at least once a week.  I always get the Carne Asada Salad with the cilantro dressing  or the Tortas  which are delicious . And the owners are so sweet  they always give my pup a dog treat 
Greens 'n Grill,15,This is genuine and delicious Mexican food made healthy. The owners are authentic and super sweet. I recommend this place to everyone as they are fast  consistent and kind.
Greens 'n Grill,16,Awesome food truck  Great food and service. Been coming here for a few weeks now  never been disappointed.
Greens 'n Grill,17,Really great food  All the menu options are extremely good and diverse  every entree is great  the carne asada bowl is my favorite. once you go here it is hard not to go back. plus the customer service is amazing  everyone is really friendly and makes sure you have a great time.
Greens 'n Grill,18,This place is so so good  I love the bowls  the hot dogs are delicious for a really good price and the vegetarian options are just as good  Highly recommend if you are at the domain and looking for something to eat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,Chipotle s don t get no respect.  But it is a fine place.  It rises above the bar for fast food.      I have said this in other reviews - but I will repeat myself here.  Fast food companies vary in whether they  sink to the level associated with fast food  or they  rise above the level associated with fast food.   Chick-fil-A and Jersey Mike s are in the  rise-above  camp. They will serve you a first rate lunch. That lunch will be not only cheap and fast but downright good.  The two main villains in the fast food game are Restaurant Brands International and Wendy s.  Restaurant Brands International runs Tim Horton s  Burger King  Firehouse Subs and Popeye s. Quality at the first three chains has tanked. This is particularly sad to see for Tim Horton s which at one point was a Canadian jewel.  What Burger King and Firehouse Subs serve is inedible. Popeye s was once a premiere fried chicken chain. It is getting worse - but hasn t tanked yet.  Wendy s runs Wendy s and Arby s. Both chains are beyond awful.     McDonald s runs McDonald s  Krispy Kreme and Chipotle. McDonald s maintains high standards on all of its properties.      At the namesake burger chain itself  quality did once tank historically. But about five to seven years ago  management saw the error of its ways. The people running the hamburger chain did a 180 degree U-Turn and Clean Up. The clean up worked. McDonald s does not serve a Yuppie quality Craft Burger. But for fast food what they serve is perfectly good.     Krispy Kreme is Krispy Kreme. You either love them or you hate them. Give me a Krispy Kreme Donut that has just come out of the fryer - and I have an orgasm right there in the donut shop.     Chipotle s is the best of McDonald s owned chains.  The meat has a good grilled flavor and tastes interesting.  Each of the different bean concoctions are different. They each pack a punch and have their own savory flavors.  The vegetables are fresh and good.  You really CAN eat healthy at a Chipotle s if you want to.   If you don t want to  you can have fun as well.   I am always happy after a meal at Chipotle s ... and what I have for lunch always catches my interest.     Service can be less than ideal.   Pickup windows are a problem in all fast food restaurants.   Inside - the design is not good - so that customers always walk to the end of the service line and not the front where you are supposed to order. Some better signage would fix this. They do not always have people manning the cash registers.  But basically  I got my food fast enough and it was fine stuff.  I would come back again happily.  They sure as hell beat the Chili s in the building next door.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,Long line at 730  Call in Order 15 Mon late  Why are employees standing around with such a long line    Horribly run store 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,This girl hates her job has a nasty attitude I worked a 12 hr shift in the sun and I don t treat people this way. Not to mention the table were dirty so when you want to sit down you have to pick a dirty table also I m confused to why you would pick a job you don t like. Manager when you read this fire her for throwing my food around like she is crazy. Pick better staff with excellent customer service. And don t try to use the excuse that it s busy we are tired of this behavior. Treat us like you would treat your family at home that you have to feed every night.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,Great customer service. Extremely accurate on timing for online orders. And I go to this location so much  they know me by name. Would recommended 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,Chipotle is a great go-to for lunch. I took my team there and we all had a great experience. I am a huge fan of barbacoa so that is what I always get when I come here.   The store was very clean and so were the restrooms. The hallway for the restrooms was very close to the serving line so it was a little confusing but other than that it was a good experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,I love Chipotle. I come to this location at least once a week since it s near my work. Today I just got a large drink and when I asked for it  the girl at the cash register said  you re going to have to pay for it . It was rude and insulting. Of course I have to pay for it   What a moron. I ll be calling the manager tomorrow.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,Service was fast despite the large amount of people they had at lunch. Staff was friendly and the place was clean
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,This location has the best rating in Austin for a reason. They re the only Chipotle that gives you the standard serving size for meat. The younger ladies all give a healthy amount of fixings but the older hispanic lady is suuuper stingy. They also get impatient if you ask for more of any of the  free  toppings.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,This place is super stingy with their portions.  They barely gave me any lettuce  cheese  beans  meat  or anything.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,Ordered for pickup.  Restaurant did not open at 10 45 as advertised.  Honor your store hours.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,Wow  their food was super fresh  and very clean line  probably the best location in Austin.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,Made my husband sick. I don t recommend eating here. My husband went her last Tuesday and got a bowl with chicken. Said chicken was off. Didn t smell right. Stopped eating 1 2 way through. An hour later he was sick. Hasn t felt right for a few days. Clearly these folks don t know how to handle food properly. Gross
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,I really like this location. It is conveniently located across from Central Market. Employees are usually friendly and helpful. I have had many positive experiences here. Only downside can be limited parking during peak hours  but normally there is sufficient parking. Good for small groups  couples or solo eaters. Another great example of a typical Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,I use to come to this location 2x a week  sometimes 3x. I loved it. Lately  when ordering online I have driven the 15 minutes there and when I get back to the office  I do not have the correct order  Missing chips  2x   Missing extra chicken  no beans  no sour cream. It has happened often enough this  time I went back to get my chips. I can t take the lunch hour to drive back and forth so I suggest you check your online order before leaving cause from what I hear from others I am not alone.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,I love chipotle. This location makes great burritos like every other chipotle. Staff is very friendly. Nice atmosphere. Sometimes my burritos are rolled wacky and I have to use a fork to eat it. And other times they skimp on the meat. Everything else is great.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,I ve been coming to this particular Chipotle local for about 3 years now and they consistently have the freshest and warmest ingredients  truly making the same bowl and burritos you get anywhere standout. Better than any I ve tried in Austin or San Antonio at that.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,The staff here is very polite and generous us with their portions  I love coming here because it s one of the cleaner and nicer chipotles in the area.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,They are so stingy with their portions. Chipotle needs to do a better job of having consistency between all their locations. The girl who was serving seemed really upset and was shoving stuff and throwing the pen around. She was giving dirty looks as well. These days especially I feel mostly agitated walking out of chipotle especially this one.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,Surprisingly stingy with their proportions. They gave me maybe half the amount in a bowl I would typically get from other locations. Usually I would ask if I could have more but out of shock and anger I didn t open my mouth otherwise I would have had to ask for more of everything. The picture doesn t lie  I had not taken a single bite after shaking it up.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,These people can t ever get your order right. And they can t easily fix so you have to reorder and pay additional fees. Ridiculous. I hope they go out of business.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,Beef was chewy and fatty.  Only hot sauce is too hot.  No medium or mild red salsa.   10 for a bowl and a large drink.  Crazy 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,I ordered a steak burrito bowl for pickup during my lunch hour today. I received my bowl but there was no steak in it and i didn t have time during my lunch break to go back to chipotle...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,I can eat a steak burrito bowl with brown rice nearly every day and be happy. Can t think of another better and more nutritional meal for the price.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,You know what to expect from Chipotle . Good food and fast.  I appreciate the good customer service as well..
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,Love that it s clean food. Fast and tasty. Been Vegan for about 6 months and they have some nice options 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,My favorite go-to meal whenever I m too lazy to cook something at home. Chipotle never fails to disappoint and I prefer this location over that on the drag.   There are a plethora of seating inside and every time I ve went  the place has looked spotless and clean.   You really can t go wrong with this location. If you re looking for a quick lunch or dinner that s not infiltrated with UT students  you should stop by this place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,Is it just this location   Or has Chipotle started on that gentle slide downhill   We used to eat at Chipotle Arbor Walk regularly.  They always churned out tasty food  and I distinctly remember feeling full and happy afterwards.  Fast forward to present day Fall 2012.  We ordered two burritos from this location.  These were smaller than usual  with less filling.  The beans were kinda tough.  The steak was even tougher.  And ugh  gristly.  The burritos  overall  were quite bland.  Such a disappointing meal     Sadly  this place rates only two stars with me.  Because I have experienced better.  Right at Chipotle s itself.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,I m not going to lie  Chipotle is my favorite place to go when I m too lazy or don t have enough time to cook at home  and despite what some other people may say  I find Chipotle superior to other burrito places  this Chipotle however is probably one of the best.  Whenever I go here  the staff is always nice and definitely friendly. I remember one time when I hesitated to ask for more rice  the guy behind the counter said to never worry about asking for more rice because he d be glad to. Another instance is when I went and they ran out of chicken and I said i was fine waiting for them to cook more  but the staff was genuinely apologetic and also gave generous portions of everything. I never hesitate to drive out to this Chipotle than to go to the one on campus because they give out generous servings.  Is this a slightly biased review  Yes. But is Chipotle delicious anyways  Yes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,Food is what you d expect from this chain. Reliable  nothing bad  but trying to appeal to the population at large.   What bothers me about this place  and therefore the low rating  was the lack of any kind of personality.  Staff looks up blankly from their ladels of beans only to ask what type you d like.  After you sidestep your way through the line and pay  all the zombie customers in the place wander around looking for a seat.  During the meal the zombies either stare at their phone or stare into their burrito.   This place epitomizes what I could imagine as a lunch time cafeteria scene from the movie Office Space.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,jesus  the 5 stars is for the fineeeeeee ass blonde dude that works the register. I can t even tell him   nah  i dont want chips and salsa   without stammering. And believe me  as a sassy  loud  independent woman- that rarely happens.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,Price of three crispy steak tacos   guacamole  no drink   9.91.  These tacos may or may not be enough to count as a full meal  depending on how attentive you are when they are made.  Be attentive  and speak up if servings are not appropriate.  Order these with guacamole as a side and the total is  8.45 before tax.    Total CEO compensation for Messrs. Ells  amp  Moran  about  50M last year according to what I am reading online.  This is a publicly-held company.    I think Ells  amp  Moran can afford to give their workers a raise  so I don t have to leave a tip anymore.  The steak has been cold in the evening lately  and the woman who rang me up tonight  I have never seen her smile.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,It was ok. I placed my order online through their website for pickup. Their online ordering proces was easy with clear pictures to see what you re ordering and adding to your item. I ordered a Sofritas Burrito Bowl with black beans and more. It was ok. I wished they would have drained all the black bean juice off before they placed it in the bowl. There tables and bar stool sitting areas were somewhat clean but the floor could have been swept. Good counter customer service. If you like eating-in and having Wi-Fi  not at this location. That was frustrating for me. It s limited parking too.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,Pretty miserable experience. Don t know if I ve been spoiled by far superior burrito places  read  Cabo Bob s. Go there instead no matter the extra distance you might have to drive - trust me .   Not only was I given a horribly meager portion of  steak   it cost me 8 bucks  The tortillas are TERRIBLE. Simply the worst tortillas I have ever eaten. The edges are rock hard and the rest is this nasty  mushy  undercooked mush. I do remember this tortilla quality issue when I used to eat Chipotle years ago  wonder why I stopped...  but it s never been this pronounced. I always finish whatever food is on my plate but I could not eat the last bites of this burrito and had to rip off layer after layer of burrito  since it is so underfilled .   This is not a delusional rant about it not being top quality food  I know what to expect from fast food but this was so  so  so poor. Chipotle needs to start declining in popularity to send a message because it s getting away with some terrible quality food and jacked up prices.  Avoid. Go to any other burrito place. Please do not give this location money lunchgoers 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,I was a big fan of chipotle when I needed a quick bite but this time was a bad experience. The person serving was serving with fear  very small proportions but at the end it was better this way because it gave me stomach ache after. The food was not even hot  most important the chicken... who know what temperature they keep it at... after this visit I think I would be looking for other options to eat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,Very poor at having called in orders ready under a certain amount of time. I would order it there if I wanted to watch you make it. Calling an order in for immediate pickup usually means the person is in a hurry. Not 1 star but not 3 either.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,Having worked at chipotle in my earlier years I can appreciate to the full extent their high quality food and wonderful guest service. This location is by far my favorite in the Austin Area  the GM is always so gracious and energetic  always ready to serve. Food is absolutely fantastic  I ve had bad experiences at many other locations but not this one  hoping I get a burrito for lunch   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,This place thinks skimping on beans and rice is good business practice.  They re wrong.  The place is close to my church  so it s an obvious quick lunch place for us  but half the time  the portions come out to be so small that I need to pop over to Taco Shack to finish my lunch.  I wrote to corporate once and their response was   You can always ask for extra beans and rice...    Nonsense.  When you talk to the line workers there  all they do is shrug and grin.  When you get a burrito half the size of what you expected  they still want to charge you full price.  Will the re-make it   No.  They just shrug and grin.  They re in the habit of hiring only drooling idiots who can do nothing but grin like idiots.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,Just recently visited this location even though I go about twice a month.  Unfortunately found two short black hairs in my bowl so I m thinking it came from the guy who put my bowl together but the customer service is great.  I ve never had a problem with this location before today and I felt awful about complaining because people do it to get free food. Anyways  their customer service is great and their food is usually 100  great 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,I go to a lot of chipotles because it s one of my favorite places to eat and this one is the worst one I ve ever been to. The lady s always have an attitude and I always feel like I m being rushed. Never a pleasant experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,First of all  this is nowhere near MEXICAN FOOD. Anyway  I used to eat Chipotle regurlary but not anymore. I stopped by to grab a bite to eat. While I was in line  amp  saw the cook put raw chicken on the grill  to  my surprise it wasnt on there but ONE minute  thats right ONE MINUTE   if you do the math thats precisely 30 seconds EACH side. Anyhow  the chicken was taken off the grill  amp  diced up put into a warmer container  amp  SERVED. It was still PINK oin the middle I  . I understand people can get too hungry to notice these kinds of things but Im glad I did.  As disgusted as I was  I went for a VEGGIE SALAD since I have a short lunch break  amp  I was hungry.   On the bright side  I was finally able to explain the bloating  amp  gas I would have for two days after eating their famous chicken burrito..  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,What can I say   As an avid chain-restaurant-hater  I love Chipotle.     sigh   Veggie burritos with gobs of black beans  yummy rice  corn salsa  sour cream  and yum yum yummy guacamole.  Mmm.  I feel guilty  but oh so satisfied.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,I ve been eating here a little more often lately than I d like to admit.  I always get the chicken burrito with black beans.  Amazingly enough  the price of a chicken burrito at the super-low  5.25 is the same as back in Fall 2000 when I was an undergraduate at UT.    In general prices are really cheap at any Chipotle and the flavor is excellent.  What converted me from a monastic lifestyle of avoiding restaurants and meat to venturing in here occasionally for lunch was Chipotle s use of naturally-raised animals and increasing use of organic beans.  The burritos are also huge and delicious.  You could easily eat half and be full.   Unfortunately  it s rare for me to be disciplined and save the other half.   The drink cups and wax paper have funny anecdotes or logos on them.      This location is great for weekday lunchtime crowd people-watching.  A variety of people come--Army reserves dressed in fatigues  hospital employees dressed in scrubs  lawyers  retirees  college students  stay-at-home moms with kids  etc...  There s often a long line at the counter  but the employees are fast and the line moves quickly as as a result.    The parking lot is big and ample  but can fill up quickly during the lunch hour.  I m always able to find parking within 2 passes around the parking lot  though.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,Even though the Chipotle near UT is a lot closer to where I live than this place  I travel an extra 10 minutes to come here because parking is great. I cannot parallel park which is why I don t travel to West Campus.   I ve been going to Chipotle for 4 years now  since freshman year  and have ordered the same burrito this whole time. I always get a burrito  rice  pinto beans  chicken  corn  sour cream  and cheese. I never get sick of it and can come here multiple times a week.   The price is not bad for the hugemonous food you are going to get. Every time I order  I always get slices of lemon to squirt on the burrito because it tastes even more yummy. Go ahead and try it    The workers are nice  seating is also available  and the water tastes great.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,I don t know what got into me today. I m a ginormous chain restaurant hater. However  I do like the bowls here. What makes it good  Well the corn salsa and the FRESHEST YUMMY GUAC. You pay a pretty penny for it but they load you up for the extra  1.75.  I ll tell you why I m reviewing this place. Its close to work  I actually got there early enough to not have to fight for a parking spot  and had a cool lunch buddy with me today. That being said  really really why  Because they played music I LIKE. haha I m such a sucker for places that play music I know and really dig.   They played LCD Soundsystem  They played Cut Copy  WTF  Awesome awesome awesome. Chipotle  you are cool again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,This chain doesn t need another good review  but I just felt compelled to write one nonetheless.  The decor and lighting contribute to enjoyable dining experiences  and it s rare in a quick-service restaurant to find freshness and quality predictable.  Oh  and I found out   Chipotle is NOT owned by McDonald s -- at least  not anymore.  Since 1998  McD s has owned an interest in Chipotle  and McD s held a majority interest from 2001 until it was fully divested in 2006  when Chipotle went public.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,This is one of the best Chipotles I ve ever been to. My boyfriend  a former Chipotle employee  and I came in during downtime  but the food was fresh and delicious. To save money  I got the burrito bol and had them pile on the extras  with a tortila on the side. They were low on fajitas  so  unfortunately  I didn t get any extra of those. But that was made okay by the fact that the fajitas were cooked PERFECTLY. I ve eaten a lot of my boyfriend s free Chipotle meals and the fajitas are really my favorite part. Oftentimes they ll be undercooked  too crunchy and pretty much flavorless  but when they re cooked right they make the meal. These were probably the best I ve had.  Anyways  I ripped up my giant burrito tortilla to make mini-tacos and had enough food left over for at least two more meals. Pretty good bang for my buck.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,I work right around the corner and since I discovered the carnitas salad bowl  i come here regularly for lunch. it s a great spicy salad and the carnitas is excellent.   I would go regularly to Central Market for soup and salad for lunch but now I prefer the carnitas salad to a CM salad  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,This location sucks compared to the one on Guadaloupe. I ve had my tortillas have been burnt to a crisp  chunks of hard fat in my overcooked steak  crunchy foreign objects in my undercooked beans  and a complete lack of flavor in my undercooked fajita vegitables.  Fight your way to the guadaloupe location. My theory is that most Chipotle locations don t get enough business to keep their ingredients fresh and properly cooked or their staff properly trained.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,I m a very regular Chipotle customer at several locations around Austin  3 4 times a week . I started coming to this place recently but I ve noticed that the amount I got was consistently less than all the other locations. The amount of meat I was getting was barely over half a scoop and I have to specifically ask for more  and I got like 3 more cubes . The service is good but the amount kind of bothers me. This gives me less incentive to come here instead of another location. Also  there are some 3G 4G dead spots within the store.  So far I ve confirmed that the area right before you start your order  while waiting in line  is definitely a dead spot. I usually try to check-in to Yelp Foursquare while in line but that doesn t work here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,I can literally eat Chipotle every day. Does that make me biased about this review  Yes.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,Other Chipotles have better customer service  but all in all its good food.  Chipotle is also on the list of places to eat for someone on the paleo diet... I love having 1 go to option when I don t want to cook.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,This might be a first for me - a 5-star rating for a chain fast food place.   But Chipotle really is terrific.  Fresh  healthy food  relatively   reasonable prices  recyclable paper food containers  yay   an excellent hot sauce  and my favorite  fresh corn relish.   For those of you with kids  the Kid s Pick Meal is terrific  especially for picky eaters.  Your kid gets to choose 3 taco fillings  with  real  food choices from the regular menu- diced meats  pinto or black beans  rice  etc.    two side flour tortillas  and then your kid can roll your own.  So  so much better than the standard fatty cheeeeeeeese quesadillas that most Tex-Mex places throw on the kids  menu alongside the ubiquitous deep fried chicken fingers and other crap.  Plus  your suspicious kid can see EXACTLY what is going into his her food and not get hung up on the worry that lurking inside might be a stray bit of lettuce.    And most exciting of all  Chipotle added brown rice as an alternative to white rice on the menu.  Brown rice at a fast food place   Be still my heart.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,Fast  good and GMO free   Normally a bowl will last me two meals.  What a deal 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,Yeah yeah yeah I love chipotle.. Who doesn t. I m only writing a review about this one because  for some reason  the steak here is always cooked perfectly.. And it s awesome. So that s all I have to say about that  cause everyone already knows how good chipotle is
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,Great Food  great atmosphere  great service  When a place has a long line at lunchtime  you know it is worth the wait 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,I don t know what it is about Chipotle. I swear I really don t like it. I mean at best it s decent fast food. The vegetarian beans are bad. The rice is flavorless. The guac is okay... I guess the vegetables are fresh enough.  But somehow I find myself unable to resist Chipotle every few months. I don t know why  but I get these inexplicable Chipotle cravings. It s like the Chipotle vegetarian  vegan  bowl takes over my brain. And at times like that  I have to have Chipotle. ASAP   This location has always been good to me. Clean  fast  plenty of parking. There s nothing particularly special about it  but when you re talking about a chain fast food restaurant  no surprises is a very good thing.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,I love Chipotle  Fast service  plentiful portions  meat cooked just right  salsa just the right spiciness  and they have beer selections 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,Avoid this location unless you like your guacamole to be mostly brown. Two times in a row without any fresh guacamole. Sad face.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,Chipotle serves up absolutely delicious burritos and bowls. This location  however  is a bit disappointing on account of the staff. They re not nearly as friendly as the staff from the other locations I ve been to. They also shrink down the portions I m used to quite a bit. Would definitely recommend chipotle to anyone  just beware of this one in particular.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,PAY ATTENTION    About a month ago I had started ordering online and after screwing up my order twice and speaking with the management I was given four burritos free and I just decided to order again figured it s been a month why not...screwed up again   It s two simple bowls. I literally am not even calling to get free food because I would rather not have to babysit the staff
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,Quick disclaimer on my review. This is a review for THIS location  4400 N. Lamar  not ALL Chipotle restaurants.  So why the bad review for this location  I m a fairly decent regular for Chipotle  8 times a month   since it s a quick fix for lunch dinner when I m too busy to sit down and eat and it s not terribly unhealthy compared to my other alternatives  read  Fast Food . Since I m at Chipotle pretty frequently and work has me in North and South Austin I m at a lot of different locations. My favorite location is the one off Parmer near McNeil  6301 West Parmer Lane  201 . My least favorite is this location.  Let s talk about why this location is terrible   1. They skimp on meats and ingredients.  if you look at other reviews  a few people have mentioned this specific to this location . Compared to other locations it s about half or 70  of what you would normally get. This is terrible. Management most likely told the employees to do it which means either A. They aren t making enough   so they have to go cheap. B. Management is just stingy.  2. Poor environment The location is too small and loud. Barely any seating during the busy times. And the management never turns on the AC or Heater. Did I mention it s not well kept up either   3. Unfriendly staff Other locations seem to have it right with their staff. This location doesn t know how to hire people or they are just unhappy employees. Also  this location does not honor any of the NATIONAL promotions unless you argue with them. Story time  I had a promotion that expired 1 31  free burrito if you bought  30 in gift card . At checkout I hand the promotion to her  Cashier without even looking at it  Sorry we don t do those here. Me   I said it should work since this is a Chipotle and this is a Chipotle promotion. Cashier  Will it s expired  once again didn t look at it   Me  It is not. Cashier  Yes it is. Read your promotion. You apparently didn t since it s faded. Me  It s not faded and it says  Expires January 31  2013 . Cashier  Oh. Me  Ok so this will work right  Cashier  Right I thought it was the other promotion. Well anyways. We won t take that for this burrito.  10 minutes later  I leave with my burrito  after threatening to call corporate .  All the other locations provide this  1. Quality amounts of food  they are all consistently the same serving size  vs the underwhelming amount the 4400 N. Lamar Chipotle location has  2. Clean and proper eating environment. AC or Heater is always on. Never too hot cold. And it s CLEAN. 3. Friendly Staff.  If you have to eat Chipotle in this area  don t. Go eat Taco Deli  it s close by and has better service. Otherwise fight the traffic and parking for the UT campus location.   
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,You ll get a very fast  mediocre lunch here.  Not many options and the ingredients are just-OK.  If you want a little nicer  tastier burrito  check out Freebirds or Changos.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,Slowest chipotle ever  with the most inept staff ever. But sadly I m a sucker and still come here because it s right down the road from my house.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,This is your friendly Central Austin location of Chipotle.  If you don t want to face finding parking on the drag  this location is usually not packed.  I recommend the vegetarian burrito with black beans.  Portions are huge  but it s kind of not the re-heatable kind of burrito  so I usually end up throwing some of it away  which makes me feel bad.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,I come here often as I work close by.  Unlike other yelpers  I ve never felt as if they have served me less meat.  I ve felt that at other Chipotles  but not this one.  A few weeks ago  I changed purses and left my wallet at home.  I didn t realize it until I got ready to pay.  The cashier totally took care of it for me and had the manager comp it.  I went back in today and tried to pay for it  as well as the salad that I was getting  and they wouldn t let me.  I call that great customer service and I ll continue to be back.  Yes the parking sucks  but if you share a small building with a Starbucks and you have a Chili s that uses the same parking lot  you shouldn t be surprised.  Frankly  anywhere you eat at on North Lamar during lunch is going to be a bit slow and packed.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66, Meh  is a pretty accurate description of this Chipotle.  Minus two stars for the bits of gristle in my chicken burrito.  Minus one star for the lame parking lot  go late during weekday lunch if you can  it gets packed .  Plus one star for having a patio  even if it does face Lamar.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,I think the  other  place is much better - but this is a great alternative when you need to eat close and quickly. I felt like I put a juicy meat  bean  rice filled peewee football in my mouth today. It was like a huge tortilla ball. Tasted good  very messy  but good. I just was looking for something else a different salsa to experiment  etc. It isn t their fault they aren t  the other place . My expectations walking in the door was deflated when I discovered you had to ask for salsa and the option is hot or medium. They definitely know how to roll a edible football - I just wish there was a little extra somethin  somethin  there to enhance the experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,Talk about good processes. You can get in and out the door of this Chipotle in under a minute. The food is fresh and you can create a number of combinations that ll be new and interesting. It s not true Mexican in my book but it s yummy and reliable food. Plus  you can custom tailor your food however you like. I always wanted to create for the world a burrito chain with great fresh food and processes. Chipotle beat me to it. Not only that  for being a chain  they have a fairly unique ambiance.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,Bowl. Rice. Black Beans. Extra Black Beans. No Meat. Pico. Both Salsas. Corn. Guac. Lettuce.   DELISHIOUSNESS.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,Burrito  please.  Pinto beans.  Uhhh  barbacoa.  Salsa   Yeahhh  the pico  the mild and the corn  please.  Sour cream and cheese  thanks.  Ninety seconds and I m satisfied.  Dudes  you either like Chipotle or you don t  It s okay  seriously.-- you go to Thundercloud over Subway  Torchy s over Taco Bell  Dan s instead of McDonald s... but give in to the corporate just this one time.  It s OKAY  I support you.  Yes  yes  I have had Freebirds  of course  and while I ve never not enjoyed my Freebirds  there s just something... SOMETHING in the Chipotle mix that connects with my taste buds in a way that Freebirds never has.  Does the mere mention of Freebirds literally make me salivate   NO.    God  THINKING about Chipotle  even a little bit  makes me crazy hungry.... and that s not helpful right now  because it s ten past midnight.  Oh  and I challenge you to be as stuffed as quickly on less than seven dollars.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,I m somewhat of a Chipotle connoisseur  and this is my favorite location.  The employees are always nice.  You can steal internet from Dim Sum.  The food is always perfect.  And they always give you a lot of food.  The main reason they get 5 stars is  they know me by my order  and usually get it goin when they see me come in.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,First of all I love Chipotle.  All of them except this one.  I went to this one and ordered a burrito and izzy drink.  Bill total    11.42 I handed the Cashier a Twenty and two ones.  She handed me back some change and a FIVE.  Anyway I was in a hurry and didn t catch the error until I was almost back to work.  I called the manager to rectify the situation and at first she was friendly and said they counted the register and found the discrepancy and would refund me the  5.  Then she called me back 30 minutes later and totally changed her tune.  She said the cashier didn t stiff me.  I KNOW BETTER.  If you buy food here not only watch your meat to make sure it isn t raw  WATCH YOUR CHANGE too.  I won t be shopping here again.  It is farily common for cashiers to stiff customers a little.   5 isn t a little.  She got greedy and I won t be eating here again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,Great chipotle. Classic layout. Friendly staff. And always delicious food 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,food  I went for lunch and got a tasty burrito that could serve a small village.  advice  don t go for lunch  don t do it. parking is non existent and the place is so tight with people it gets claustrophobic  not good considering the amount of beans being consumed. with it being so packed and loud all I wanted was to escape with my togo  I asked for black and got pinto and didn t mention anything about cheese yet received a handful  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,This place is beyond awesome. It s always clean and the restrooms are always in good shape. I come here at least twice a week.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,5 stars for great service   I don t think I ve ever had service this good at a fast food place.  They re always so friendly here and they always give me extra cheese on my burrito when I ask.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,Bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland  bland.  Repeat if necessary.   P.S. The food is fresh and Tabasco is not salsa.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,The chicken at this location is mostly charred connective tissue with a little meat in there somewhere. Disgusting. Why even serve chicken  
Los Danzantes ATX,1,We came to the Far Out Lounge to see the Battle Of The Bands.  When it came time to eat during one of the intermissions we decided to get tacos. Since I am a picky eater I had to really look at the menu and made the decision to get the Tlayuda Oaxaque a. I originally thought I was going to ask them to 86 some items but I changed my mind.   It was an extra large crispy corn tortilla   pork lard  beans  cheese  chorizo and cabbage. I asked if the chorizo was spicy and I was told it was not. It didn t taste spicy either. My daughter on the other hand picked the same menu item as mine but 86 d everything except the cheese. She didn t care for it but instead decided that since I still had everything on my she ate half. I feel like it must be good if she ate it.   I can say that I will probably follow them wherever they go and who knows I might try more items.
Los Danzantes ATX,2,Pretty lackluster food  especially given the amount of competition for Mexican food in this area. I m really surprised by the other comments here.  We split the birria plate   16 . The birria was literally just a little cup of unflavored beef fat  and the meat itself was completely unseasoned and bland. The tacos were extraordinarily greasy  to the extent that the tortillas had become saturated with orange paste. The tortillas were good quality  at least.   They collect cell phone numbers that they use to notify you when your order is ready. I m a bit concerned about whether they share or sell their cell phone number database.
Los Danzantes ATX,3,An inconspicuous family-owned food truck that will surprise you with the amount of flavor they have packed in their birria tacos   Juicy  flavorful  and tender bites of beef and melty cheese with a side of gorgeous dipping broth.  This was my first time trying birria style tacos  and it was one for the books   If you stop by the Far Out Lounge  you gotta give this spot a chance.
Los Danzantes ATX,4,This is our go-to place for delicious Birria tacos in Austin. They have the freshest ingredients and the food has an authenticity unlike any other  Good vibes  good food  good people.
Los Danzantes ATX,5,My 2nd time trying birria tacos and they were event better  So good and glad they have a home at The Far Out
Los Danzantes ATX,6,Please note they are a food truck located at Far Out Lounge.   This food was not good  it was GREAT  When you add friendly staff you can guarantee a customer for life and that is exactly what you get from Los Danzantes.   My food was full of flavor  everything looked and tasted fresh. We were also so lucky to get a side of beans that just melt in your mouth. Anyone who knows me knows I love beans  but I promise you have never had beans this yummy. I would go back just for them too    My daughter and I were craving birria tacos after a long flight back home  and luckily this place was not out of our way from my dog sitter s house. We could not be any happier we stopped by. I live in north Austin and will be happy to make the trek back here anytime. Even more points for the great selection of beers that Far Out Longe has to choose from.
Los Danzantes ATX,7,Came back again  In fact  we ve become biweekly regulars at the Far Out Lounge because of Los Danzantes...  I can t tell you how amazing the food  they re service  their personality and cheer  is. They re amazingly passionate people  you can feel it.  But let s be clear  it s about the culture  and making sure you participate  appreciate it. They re amazing ambassadors for Oaxacan fare.  The Tlayuda is different than anything you ve tasted before. It s massive  intimidating and delicious but it s not as heavy as it looks.   The birria tacos with cheese are as heavy as they look. By my are they special. The crispiness  the meats flavor  the cheese and then you dip it into the consume...wowser.   The thing is  they know food  they excel at it. But I think they re specialty is the experience they give you  that s next level.   Their passion is sincere  their talent undeniable and their future unlimited.
Los Danzantes ATX,8,La gringa del south. Amazing. Great pastor. Amazing green hot sauce. Highly recommend 
Los Danzantes ATX,9,If you like Birria....you re going to love this place  If you ve never had Birria but like tacos....you re going to love the Birria tacos from this place  I had been wanting Birria tacos for awhile. When I heard this place was located in the back area of the far out lounge  my wife and I took a drive over there to grab some food. We were blown away with the tacos. Super good  This food truck will be going into our rotation for sure.
Los Danzantes ATX,10,Went to this gem of a place last weekend for brunch. Best chilaquiles I ve had in Austin in a very very long time   Tried the verde and rojo and still Couldn t decide on my fave. Will make this a regular spot for us. The owner is very nice and made us feel like we were eating at our own backyard.
Los Danzantes ATX,11,I came for the Motown Monday revue to see friend is the show and noticed lots of food trucks. We decided to try the birria tacos from los Dazantes and was not disappointed  These things are awesomely tasty 
Los Danzantes ATX,12,Absolutely fantastic birria tacos. I ve had a bunch of birria in Austin and these are my favorite so far. Amazing consume  meat is so tender and flavorful...and the cheese...just perfect. Come try these guys out. Super friendly owner and family. I would be here every week if lived closer.
Los Danzantes ATX,13,Really sweet team but we were not impressed by the food - the quesadilla was bland and nothing special really. At those prices  and publicity  I expected some creativity  some creations. This food truck is more hype  less flavor.
Los Danzantes ATX,14,Birria taco plate was amazing   Great place to hang out on an afternoon with friends and enjoy some delicious tacos 
Los Danzantes ATX,15,AMAZING Birria tacos  It s hard to find Birria plates with no cheese  But this place has them and they re soooooo goood. I am definitely going to be a new regular    Do not skip these tacos 
Los Danzantes ATX,16,Mere words cannot convey how flipping delicious the birria quesatacos were. The broth was thick and bursting with flavor. The best I ve ever had  so far .... Oh and don t forget to add their salsa macha  That stuff is gold and they actually sell it by the jar  
Los Danzantes ATX,17,Inside the Far out Lounge. Best birria tacos I ve had. Worth the drive from North Austin. Tacos are full of flavor and meat. Very juicy  and the conzume is excellent. They sold out as soon as we ordered our tacos. We will be coming back for more 
Los Danzantes ATX,18,Wow.  Best tacos in town   It s located at the Far Out Lounge. My husband and I have been here for take out  3-4 times the past couple of weeks.  I am so so so glad that we live right down the street. My husband and I get off of work at 5pm and we are usually starving because we work without lunch... and we wait that extra hour after work until los danzantes opens at 6pm just to eat here... we wish they would open at 5pm but can t complain because they taste so good   We usually get there 6pm sharp to put in our order lol.  You have the option to buy the birria consome separately and even the leftover consome tastes amazing the following day with rice.. the meat quality AND quantity in their al pastor tacos is on another level..  oh and just look at the cute way they cut their radishes   The owners are beyond lovely and always so kind.  We look forward to getting takeout from here every Thursday and Friday and finish the week off with a glass of home made ranch water.
Los Danzantes ATX,19,So good and super friendly  At a great venue so you can grab a bite and listen to some live music
Los Danzantes ATX,20,Really good but total came to  20.78     for three teeny tacos with an extra consomme.  OUTRAGEOUS.  Probably won t get it again.
El Agazajo's,11,This is definitely a hidden gem off of 183  and truly shocked at only 1 review under there belt....So Im here to change that....Service was spot on....they have been open for about 5 months  and from what I get the Chef bought the restaurant from the owner....Very glad they did....We started with the starters....Queso  Loaded   Salsa-Red and Green-along with some pickled veggies and crunchy chips....Now that Red Salsa was and still is a talking point for us...smoky  fresh tasting and a great little kick...Its up there as some of the best we have had...a scoop of that was a perfect match for the Queso....The food did take a bit to come out  BUT its made to order and landed on the table piping Hot...We will never complain about that  and we are never in a hurry when we go out to eat  we are there to take in the whole experience. Wife went with the Beef Enchiladas with Chipotle and double rice. Chipotle was a bit on the sweeter side but still good. Beef was good on its own...I went with Chicken Enchiladas with Suiza Sauce....Great Flavor  creamy and the chicken was seasoned very well...Both sets of Enchiladas were packed to the brim....We both enjoyed the rice  very light and fluffy...Again another great find was the refried Black Beans...Simply amazing flavor  even better with the rice mixed it...Start to finish this was a great visit  and best thing another spot that is close to the house  as we frequent this area often.
El Agazajo's,12,You wouldn t think this small place along the highway would be so good  but you d be wrong. We had the Dora s tacos and left wanting more  The tortillas are amazing. My niece got a simple kids plate with rice and beans. She never eats that part but here this was the first thing she ate AND finished  I was jealous  after trying a bite  that I didn t order a plate with it. We will make the detour and come back next time we are in Austin and so should you.
El Agazajo's,13,Very yummy and great service    We got the chicken enchilada with the suiza suave and the beef burrito. Both were great and the portions were large.
El Agazajo's,14,We just flew in from Washington and stopped at the first place we saw on our way to our air bnb. The food here is fantastic  Loved the chicken enchiladas and queso dip  Hoping to be back for pizza soon.
El Agazajo's,15,Great pizza and wings   Crispy  thin crust pizza with the perfect ratio of toppings.  Really good wings  too. We will definitely return and try the Mexican dishes.  The salsas were delicious  with great flavor and spice.  Great service as well.
El Agazajo's,16,i am giving 4 stars because they had good customer service when we went there 1 hour before closing time. we were the only customers there on a Sunday night before I had to leave out of Austin airport . They probably thought they were closed down completely for the night   but they still served us and tended to our needs. my husband ordered a chicken burrito  and i ordered a quesadilla. the portion sizes were both very small. the flavor was good  but the food seemed to have been warmed up  maybe leftovers. not entirely sure.  the quesadilla had bell pepper  inside. - that was so so. the quesadilla really seemed more like an appetizer to me.  the kids meal for my toddler they served us was nice it had rice. beans and a chicken taco  shredded . they didn t serve it too warm so he didn t get burnt and that was nice.  my only issue was that the size of the portions even though it filled us up  it seemed like a mini quesadilla compared to most places i ve been to. i ordered it with carne asada and the seasoning was nicely done. i didn t really care for bell peppers in a quesadilla so i picked some of them out. it didn t come with anything. my husbands burrito he said he really enjoyed but it didn t come with anything either. I am not sure if I would go back or not  we were curious about their pizza but I didn t want to be an asshole and order it an hour before closing especially since the restaurant looked super clean
El Agazajo's,17,Great Food  Pizzas New York style made by David de Leon are amazing  and Mexican Style food is really good  Fajitas are delicious   service is also really good so I recommend it... 
El Agazajo's,18,The service was very sweet and amicable  the meals are very good and they re very accommodating during COVID. We came here for breakfast and I had the omelet. Some of my friends had the other breakfast options and we were all very satisfied. Would come here again.
Frida's Cocina,1,Frida s Cocina has the best breakfast tacos in Austin  I eat here 2-3 times a week and I m still not tired of it. The portions are huge  one taco is usually enough for me  and comes with quick and friendly service. My favorite is El Diego with their  hot salsa   salsa verde   if I m hungry I ll add bacon and avocado. Support local business 
Frida's Cocina,2,4 stars because the tacos are pretty good  and the location is nice. It s next to an amazing coffee place  madrones  and a cute outdoor seating area with a music stage. The tacos are huuuuge and packed full of flavor. I would definitely skip the chilaquiles though. The chips seemed like they were bought at a grocery store and not of high quality. Also  the green sauce is no joke... Too spicy for most I would say  even those who claim they like spicy. It just takes over the flavor of the dish. Just try the tacos   
Frida's Cocina,3,One of the best migas tacos I ve ever had. Will absolutely be back to try more of their menu.
Frida's Cocina,4,What an absolute find  Frida s is tucked in the parking lot of Madrones. For some reason GPS sometimes will direct you to the field next to it so put in madrones. Parking is easy but can quickly get packed. We stopped by at 830am and had no wait. We didn t realize how huge the tacos were so got two each. The tacos were stuffed to the brim and delicious  Sauces were great. Will be back 
Frida's Cocina,5,Hands down best taco I ve ever had. I lived in southern CA for 6 years so I ve had my fair share of tacos. This was by far the best. Amazing price point  and short wait. She uses exceptional quality products and it shows  Frida is the sweetest   10 10 recommend.
Frida's Cocina,6,The chilaquiles are gross. Just tasteless globs of cheese with eggs and barely any tortilla.  It was NOT real chilaquiles. Please will places in this city stop butchering the tasty delight that is chilaquiles      I couldn t have more than 3 bites of this. I had a taco too - it s nothing to write home about. Again  very tasteless. So confused by all the good reviews of this place.
Frida's Cocina,7,Hands down my favorite breakfast taco place in Austin  Huge portions  great flavor  fast delivery and very kind customer service. The value for the prize is amazing as well as the location. I enjoy stopping by on my way to work to get tacos and coffee next to the lovely Madrones coffee shop... sometimes I just stay at the coffee shop and work  10 10
Frida's Cocina,8,Feeling early-morning famished  Head over to Frida s Cocina food truck In Oak Hill. The breakfast menu offers some hearty tacos  but the Chilaquiles Bowl is an absolute must. It offers some crunch and zing from a mixture of salsa and tortilla chips. Served with it is a combination of bean  egg and avocado slices. Yum 
Frida's Cocina,9,Took my order in correctly and the potato tacos were both inedible not because the food was bad but they put beans on the taco and it poured out of both ends and destroyed the shell and was just a sloppy mess so I had to throw both of them away. I called three times and left a message immediately after getting home gave them plenty of opportunity to get back to me before I wrote this review nobody ever did. It was my first time and last time going there.  UPDATE  literally the minute i posted a review i was receiving calls from them. Yall need to work on your customer service. 100 
Frida's Cocina,10,My fav tacos in Austin and the service is . Portion size  proportions and taste are off the chain 
Frida's Cocina,11,I m always on the lookout for new places for breakfast tacos. My standard taco order is potato  egg  and cheese  but at Frida s the cheese is just overkill. Stick to two ingredients  that s my advice. Each taco is enough for two people  filled with the fluffiest of scrambled eggs.
Frida's Cocina,12,Great tacos. Very fresh. We tried the chicken  the steak  the spicy shrimp and the vegetarian. All were excellent. Nice portion size.
Frida's Cocina,13,I love these tacos  I ve tried some breakfast tacos and their chicken tacos for lunch and they both did not disappoint. Very large and filling too 
Frida's Cocina,14,These tacos are huge and delicious. Service is great and you can order online. So nice to have another option in my neighborhood 
Frida's Cocina,15,Best steak tocos in south Austin  bar none. My only issue is they don t serve lunch until 1 00. I get up at  6 00  and I eat lunch at 12 00 and that s when I want my damned steak taco. Alas  I guess they have to cater to all the late sleeping South Austin Hipsters.
Frida's Cocina,16,Friendly people and great tacos  Love the vegetarian options. It is a food truck and there is plenty of space to eat outside or inside. Love coming here for breakfast or lunch
Frida's Cocina,17,Gorditas are delicious  I only tried the Asado and Rajas con queso. Super affordable and tasty food.
Frida's Cocina,18,This is my go to breakfast taco place now. Near by  fast service you can call ahead   great tacos. They put a whole piece of bacon in there   LOVE THAT  
Frida's Cocina,19,Giant tacos with authentic taste  Made to order fresh. Received order in 4 minutes and sat under the huge oak this morning. Wonderful place and great tacos. So glad they are here. Go support them 
Frida's Cocina,20,Visitors from Houston  This food truck was so good and easy to locate. This is a great gem that we found along our route to Hamilton pool and back to the Lakeview resort.  We ordered a gordita  a cup of beans   and chorizo taco with corn tortillas. Everything was very tasty  If I come back to the area I ll come back.  Don t forget to check in and use the deals they offer  The food looked and tasted  so good that we forgot to take photos. They also have a vegan option if you re interested.  The owners are very nice people   good customer service.
Frida's Cocina,21,The menu photos looked amazing when I first checked out Frida s Cocina website and the actual food matched up perfectly. I ate the fiery vegan bowl with chicken and all the flavors of the zucchini mix  rice  beans  avocado came together nicely for a very satisfying  delicious meal. THe guacamole was so fresh and not over powering with multiple ingredients. As a Mom of two boys with little time to cook  this food truck met not only my hunger cravings and tastes  but also my boys  they had the chicken quesadilla  and I didn t have to go far from home to get it  Our family will definitely be returning in the next week. Thank you so much Viri 
Frida's Cocina,22,Best Al Pastor tacos that I ve ever eaten. Very nice people. And they have vegan options. Had some issues with navigation - it sent me further north than its actual location. And parking could have been better.
Frida's Cocina,23,This has to be the greatest place to get authentic Mexican food. We ordered a pambazo and 3 tacos of Al Pastor and 1 tacos of chicken. Everything is made fresh to order while they have many options for vegans  vegetarians and meat lovers. I give there food a 10 10 for presentation and taste. It held up to my expectations as it reminded me of back home for sure. I would totally recommend this place to others and would come back for more. Also  great customer service and for always going a step further too   
Frida's Cocina,24,This is my 2nd time at Frida s and for the 2nd time  it s great  The pollo asado has big chunks of grilled chicken and is yummy and the corn tortillas are fresh and delicious. Their prices are very reasonable. And the lady that takes the orders is very nice and informative. I ll be going again soon.
Don Juan,1,The food and hospitality were great. Our server was nice and answered any questions we had. The food was prepared quickly and it was good.  Like other reviewers say  don t judge it by what it looks like on the outside. The inside is nice and their food is great 
Don Juan,2,Depending on what you get  you might rate it differently. Service was good.  The quesadilla and burritos are very good.    Their mole not so good and my pork chop with chipotle was not good.  It was over cooked and maybe fried to much not sure.    They have a large menu so lots of options for everyone.  They even have burgers and fries that were very good.
Don Juan,3,We ve been returning to Don Juan s for several years. At first we stopped there because it was conveniently close to were we could meet for lunch. Now  it s a destination we choose. We were pleased as always by the food quality  quantity  staff  and price  but overwhelmingly  and why I m reviewing  is because of the delightful investment in all new dining room furniture and a new hand crafted bar. The restaurateur had all the tables  chairs  booths  bar  and even the baby chairs hand crafted with embroidery and hand painted traditional scenes. A must visit see.
Don Juan,4,Y all  This place is legit for breakfast tacos  Don t let the outside building fool you  They have a special deal where if you order three breakfast of the same tacos is  4.25. So cheap. I ordered three chorizo and egg and 1 sausage and egg tacos. They were so good  Their salsas green and red were so good. I highly recommend this place  Yes they take credit cards
Don Juan,5,Dont let the outside fool you. The food is amazing and they have very friendly service. Alo the booths are amazing.
Don Juan,6,Doesn t look like much when your driving past  but I was dying of hunger so I popped in for lunch  true definition of a hole in the wall place and oh boy let me tell you what  for starters the chips and salsa was fire. I ordered a Don Juan burrito and the food was hot and the chicken savory and rice and seasoned just right if I could give it more than 5 stars I would
Don Juan,7,My hungry-bunch wanted Enchiladas so I stopped in. We ordered. Ground Beef  Cheese Enchiladas in Red Sauce. I ordered Mole Enchiladas with Ground Beef and a large Agua Fresca Tamarindo. It was the Best Enchiladas we have ever encountered in South Austin  The food was great  Perfectly seasoned  salad fresh with guacamole. Beans  amp  Rice were great compliments to entree. The whole vibe was inviting  This is our new place for Mexican Food 
Don Juan,8,This place is amazing  Its like Denny s meets great Mexican food    I just bought a house nearby and was hungry and stopped by to give it a shot and man was I totally not disappointed.   The pork chop and egg meal was great  The pancakes were just pancakes nothing fancy but Mexican food and pancakes is a killer combo.  I came back a few days later and go the Mexican flag enchiladas .. totally awesome. You could tell they were made fresh to order and the sauces were killer.   They also have a large selection of Aquas Frescas and Mexican Sodas as well as great Michelada s   You want to eat here  be it breakfast or lunch they wont disappoint.
Don Juan,9,The breakfast here is better than dinner in my opinion -FYI. We have been here a couple of times for breakfast and it s been good each time. You can get a Mexican style breakfast or just eggs and bacon and pancakes. We recently stopped in here for dinner. I ordered the chicken nachos. The chips here are not my favorite so I probably should have ordered something different. The toppings were good though. My husband got the chimichanga and he said was just ok too. I think if we come back for dinner we ll try something else on the menu. We ll definitely be back for breakfast at some point since we live in the area.
Don Juan,10,Ok I gave them another chance but this time we did dinner. We called in beef enchiladas and fajita nachos. They said ten minutes. We got there and the food was ready and fresh  I asked to add a torta but they were out. BUMMER  I got green sauce on my enchiladas  they were very good and spicy  The beef skirt was tender unlike most which is chewy if not cooked right. Hubbie loved his nachos and so did I. He couldn t finish them so I took care of that for him    The rice and beans were ok. Not bad  not superb. Just ok. All in all they re a-ok with me.
Don Juan,11,Enchiladas verdes       Yes       Im Mexican and I approve this meal place  So so so good and service was great 
Don Juan,12,Best breakfast tacos in S. Austin. We eat breakfast here several days a week. Great friendly service. Salsa is fresh and tasty. Tacos are hot  tasty and large.  Very quick service.  If you like divy Taco places this one is top notch.
Don Juan,13,Great authentic Mexican tacos  tostadas  quesadillas and more. A great small town feel  family owned place.
Don Juan,14,This is our tradition practically for sundays and sat ams  LOVE the Chilaquiles  The service is quick and the food is always hot  amp  delicious. The chips  amp  salsa are a fun add on and if you are feeling adventurous we love the Chile Relleno as well  The breakfast pancakes are awesome too - hot  amp  fluffy 
Don Juan,15,The service is sometimes  not often though  spotty. Only once did I have to get my food to go. The have a pretty big menu and I think are open for breakfast to  but I ve only ever been for lunch I m in love with their Torta Cubana. It is almost too much for one person. it s so big. And the tastes all melding together... Mm mm good. You get complimentary chips and salsa and it seems the salsa is homemade bc sometimes it s got a good bite and sometimes no.
Don Juan,16,Good food. Great prices.  We go for breakfast most weekends.  Our favorites are Mexican Eggs and Ranchero Eggs.  They have no problem substituting the papas for extra beans or salad.  The green salsa is GOOOOOOOD.
Don Juan,17,Best migas tacos in Austin. Great hot sauce too. Everyone really friends and the service is quick. I hit this place up a few times a week.
Don Juan,18,This is my favorite breakfast taco place in Austin   The green salsa is AMAZING   And their flour tortilla are to die for. Can never go wrong with a bean and cheese taco   10 10 would recommend to a friend.
Don Juan,19,I tried this place a couple of times. Its like any other  mexican restaurant . The only thing I liked is that they had homemade corn tortillas but then they stopped. I asked what happened and they said the tortilla lady was sick  and I guess she was sick forever  So I have yet to find an authentic mexican restaurant
Don Juan,20,Delicious food  fun atmosphere  drive through  and surprisingly strong margarita  -  we will absolutely come here again  give it a try 
Don Juan,21,I live right around the corner and can t help put always order takeout tacos  SO YUMMY
Don Juan,22,We were pleasantly surprised by this place  The food was good and the service was prompt and nice. And breakfast was super inexpensive   There may be some language barriers. A friend asked what the sauces on the table were and the waitress said  red and green.  Still don t know what they were  but they were good   
Don Juan,23,This place used to be La Tapatila and was pretty good. I noticed that they changed name owners so I decided to try it for lunch.  The menu had quite a variety so I took a few minutes to look it over. I ordered a water and the waitress came back with a glass of water and some chips and salsa. The water was just tap water  which wouldn t have been so bad  but they didn t have any ice. The chips were stale. From where I was sitting  I could see behind the counter and they had a big bin of chips sitting underneath a stainless steel table out in the open. Who knows how long the chips have been sitting.  I ordered the combination plate and chose beef fajita and al pastor. When the food came out  they forgot the tortillas. By the time they came out the food a cooled down. While the food was edible  it really didn t taste that good.  For the price  I won t be going back any time soon.
Don Juan,24,I had a late lunch here today with my girlfriend. She is lying in bed sick right now. If it wasnt for my iron stomach i would be right next to her.  Enough said......
Don Juan,25,Hi yelpers  My family and I were around Ben white and were so hungry that we decided to check restaurants around us with yelp    So we found Don Juan not far and we decided to see if those reviews were really as good as they said.  Our experience was AWESOME  the waitress came pretty fast and they took care of our order leaving some chips and salsa. Man  when I tried those chips  I knew that this place might be that good  Well  we ordered tacos  huevos rancheros and huevos a la mexicana. Well  I have to tell my wife is very picky with mexican s restaurants and she just loved everything  The kiddos did the same    We are sorry they are not that close to our house... way north of Austin   Well DONE Don Juan 
Don Juan,26,Pretty good food. It definitely seemed like a popular place. Migas was ok but chorizo  amp  potato taco was better. Salsa was too spicy but it might have been bc I was hungover....
Don Juan,27,Ist off the breakfast taco deal only in the morning is great.  Drive thru or pick up  usually fast. For  3.something.  The afternoon is sometimes a bit  UGH  the staff really isn t attentive . amp  sometimes takes awhile for ur food .. But the aguas are delish
Don Juan,28,The agua de melon or guayaba was not fresh. The rice and beans were not good. Did not have a really spicy salsa. When I tried to use a Groupon like certificate from my company  they would not honor it.
Don Juan,29,Unfortunately I went here to work because it was listed as having WIFI but that isn t true so I had to leave.
Don Juan,30,This place is right by my house so I eat here a couple times a month. The food is decent and cooked to order  and fresh. Prices are decent too. Some of the waitresses can t speak english so they might f  k up your order if they can t understand you and bring you something totally different than what you ordered  unless you speak spanish . The interior is dingy and unimpressive  but more utilitarian with beer signs up on the walls. The people are nice though  and you can order beer here which is a plus in my book. In other words  I recommend it for a divey Mexican restaurant.
Don Juan,31,I was looking for a quick place to pick up food  and saw this place has a drive-thru. It is not only inexpensive  but pretty delicious. Their 3 breakfast taco special is so inexpensive. For a while  I picked up food from here at least once a week. But now I live farther away. Even my roommate  who is a very critical with Mexican food  loves this place. Strangely  I ve never been inside. Oh and warning  the drive-thru is what you could expect from a hole-in-the-wall.
Don Juan,32,All I can say is the food here is awesome  and they are very flexible with the orders I would recommend the Don Juan parriada I like to sub pastor instead of the pork chops  this thing is huge   The parriada for 2 is 2 meals each for my girlfriend and i. I will take pics of this thing so everyone can see.oh yeah the green sauce is my favorite. I eat there all the time
Don Juan,33,Donnnn Juannnnn it s the best in Austin Gtown come on down where the best sit.food in ur belly money in ur pocket.  I am a Bigggg fan still the day I die.
Don Juan,34,Eh.  I hate to give them 2 stars because the lady was so so nice who helped me. I got the crispy tacos but they were stale as could be. The food was not very great. I didn t finish my plate and I feel like I may be in a MSG coma right now typing this up. I do not know if they use msg or not though. The place could be a tad cleaner as well. The price is a dollar too high on the quality of food they are serving.
Don Juan,35,Happened to be in town and stayed in a hotel nearby.  Inexpensive  but the food is good at the price and plentiful.  Haven t been to many other Mexican restaurants in the area but I definitely enjoyed the meal.
Asadas Grill,1,This place is a gem  Our waiter  Marcos was excellent and very knowledgeable on all of the dishes we inquired about and recommended great drink choices.   We came during happy hour and took advantage of the fresh salad bar. Great variety   The steak fajitas were so juicy that they melted before I was able to chew. Omg. We have a winner. I had the house margarita and was not disappointed. It was not watered down and matched to perfection with the fajitas.   Marcos recommended coming back when there is live music because it s a vibe. Say less my brother  see ya soon.   100  recommend 
Asadas Grill,2,Service for 10 was incredibly slow. One server and one bartender for the entire restaurant. Our server did the best he could so we can t say much about that. He was attentive when he was around and took care of us. Thank you Carlos   Food was unacceptable - all meat was ordered medium rare. Ribeye came out pretty much raw cooked on low heat. Asada came out well done.   Salad bar is disappointing  would not return.
Asadas Grill,3,Food is really good. I ve been there several times and was not given any info on the buffet bar being included with your entree.   Establishment needs to either post this on their message board or have the waiters waitresses be clear of what comes with the entree.  The food is great though   
Asadas Grill,4,This place popped up in the location Zed s used to be so we thought we would give it a try.  I loved the atmosphere and the service was excellent.  The Margaritas were fantastic  We also order the ceviche which was fresh and tangy.    Overall the food was decent but was a little bland at times.
Asadas Grill,5,I love this place and it keeps getting better.  There s a new side patio augmenting the little stage for music  beautiful lawn and water feaure out back  the menu has added a few more cuts of steak  which I order frequently here  and it s simply a pretty place to eat outside and enjoy elevated food for a reasonable price.  My wife and I shared Ceviche that was great  and we ve had the grilled queso and other delights here  too.  Even the salad bar is packed with a different hot soup every day  cheese  and charcuterie.  My asada was excellent  and the band played musica tradicional while we enjoyed our meal.  Our server  Dulce  was very attentive.  5 stars 
Asadas Grill,6,I had the worse experience here   First let s talk about how we had a reservation at 8 and got seated at almost 9 . The whole party was there. In the lobby waiting ...... we made the reservation 2weeks before . I think they had more than enough time to properly plan. Things happen we all know that . But It would of been to get updates as we waited in the lobby   not just getting starred at by the host manager because we were taking up space in the lobby . It s was 18 of us . That is why we called in advanced   as well as confirmed to our 40 min prior confirmation call that asadas them self did to us.    Next we get orders taken   I ordered a steak   food comes and it s okay until a fly decides to land on my food and pretty much remained on my food .  Keep in mind server never came to check and make sure that our food was okay. I obviously didn t eat it .   Manager came  Franceli  and was notified of what occurred and only said  I m sorry but did you try to swatting it away   Like it directly landed in my steak    And that s it she continued her convo with the Ithaca guest . .....   Next 30 min later the server comes and she ask if I would like a box for my un eaten steak ... I told her no   there was a fly In it . And she said in sorry takes my plate and walks away ..... at this point I m over it    I wasn t looking for a free meal   nor to be difficult as I myself work Industry. But like a steak is an expensive meal ...  i still paid   and tipped on top of that   because again I wasn t looking for a free meal    Service was horrible both the manager and server need to take some time to learn proper customer service .   Drinks were terrible   my Mexican martini tasted like oj and sweet and sour ... but i wasn t going to say anything bc I was already over the fact that we continued to get dismissed   If I could give this place  negative stars I WOULD  
Asadas Grill,7,Terrible experience. My girlfriend called ahead to ask if they were still serving a seasonal dish and was told yes over the phone. Got to the restaurant and she ordered the seasonal dish. The waitress came back several minutes later to tell us they no longer have the ingredients for the dish.  I tried to order pastor tacos and the waitress said they have been out of pastor meat for over a week. So we just ordered drinks and they brought me the wrong beer. I doubt we will ever go back.
Asadas Grill,8,Drinks are fantastic  music and ambience are fantastic.   Food  is bland. We all left our food on the plates.  Guy who ordered chicken quesadillas had Guacamole that was dark green like it sat out for a few hours. He ate one triangle and didn t say anything.  The chicken mole person  is from Mexico  and she just smiled as she left her food there. I asked what she thought  and she kindly said  it tasted like the mole had no flavor and the chicken was over cooked.  For me  the carnitas did not taste like carnitas. They were cold  and lacked flavor.  We left the food and paid.  We did drink their amazing drinks.  Service was fantastic.
Asadas Grill,9,No more Zed s.  The upscale-ish  happy hour   date-night vibe is gone.    Asadas seems to be hanging onto that cool Zed s vibe  but the beautiful setting  awesome patio with live Tejano music  and ambitious menus don t seem to mesh with some of the cheesy touches  hit-or-miss service  and very-kid-friendly atmosphere. They are still a little new and everything about it is just not cohesive yet.    For example  the menu has a lot of wow-factor  but you can tell where they are cutting corners  like with those awful cardboard-like tortilla chips and the frozen key lime pie being passed off as a Margarita pie.   Another example   the Huachinango al Ajo.  A lot of pride goes into cooking it  but the presentation ruins it--served on old wood boards  mine was warped and missing the metal handle   with sad rice and plain spring mix.  The Lado Bar for  8.95 seems like something that would be great if you re just there for drinks and nibbles  but it is included with most    meals.  Therefore  it s almost always picked over and bare.  Maybe it should be a standalone menu item.  Another cheese factor example   the  El Jarro .  It s supposed to be a fun  giant drink for four people  mixed at your table in a large clay container.  Really...it s just tacky as can be.  It reminds me of those 1 2-gallon drinks at Razzoo s  but at least those are over-the-top hilarious with beads and alligators and whatnot.  El Jarron is like drinking out of a bucket from a backyard shed.  I m honestly on the fence with Asadas restaurant and I do plan on returning  but for now just three stars.
Asadas Grill,10,It s been about three months since our last visit here and we decided to come in for an early dinner on Sunday. They were seating everybody inside and the patio was empty. After a few minutes you ll be given a small plate of chips and a dab of bean dip along with 1 ounce of salsa complimentary. The problem is  these chips taste cheap and are not very authentic. The queso is advertised as queso Fresca but it comes off more as Velveeta  and no jalape os   Our waitress was fairly attentive but we did have to wave her down. If I had to sum up all of my fellow yelpers  you ll find that the food is OK  but not great  but the drinks are really good. I have to admit  the frozen margaritas made up for the less quality food items. I think it s fair to say that if they ever water down the drinks they ll be out of business. The one thing that cost them a star is the fact that they charge you for using a credit card and you ll notice it at the bottom of the receipt such as the one I have pictured in 2nd review. Although  you can see it on the receipt in my first review. In conclusion  the drinks will definitely have me coming back ........ the food maybe not so much  there s better tex mex in the area.
Asadas Grill,11,My neighbor recommended this place to me. She said the drinks were great and the food was sooo good. I finally stopped and tried it and the place is beautiful and the food looks beautiful as well  however...the food was not tasty and my drink was less than to be desired. My husband got a margarita and it was good. Food wise I got the chicken mole enchiladas which were dry and super cold. We waited forever and the waiter said it was because of my husbands fish tacos.... So in turn my food must have been sitting there while they were waiting for his food. So the whole dinner was one I would not return for.... But the Tres Leches cake was awesome     I will give this place one more chance because it s close to my house and they have a Sunday Brunch I want to try. Hopefully it was just a bad day.
Asadas Grill,12,Just slap us surprised and delighted    Full disclosure too...we re foodies from downtown  I know...tragedy  but we ve also been in Austin 20  years and tonight s experience was such a happy surprise.   Our days  errands and such took us longer than expected and we found ourselves in round rock with any decent restaurant at least an hours  wait...and we were getting too hangry for all that business. Saw Asadas on OpenTable and figured maybe it was too new to trust the few reviews. DANG I m glad we decided not to listen to Yelp for once      Immediately upon entering  the staff were so welcoming and made us feel glad to be coming in. We chose a table out on the patio and it was the absolutely perfect choice  The scenery is so much lovelier than RR staples - took a picture legit so I could share here    Now the food and drink cuz I mean...that s what REALLY matters   We are margarita snobs. Figured I d get that out there. Don t come near our glasses with sour mix or triple sec. We absolutely never find a restaurant north  or hey  even most downtown  that gets it right  off the menu even  the first time This place  Perfect result with the skinny right off the menu. Second order replaced tequila with Mezcal and again...fabulous. This alone would be reason for people like us to come back.   Ordered ceviche and guacamole for apps and generous portions of deliciously prepared  truly authentic fresh food. We just got back from Mexico last week  so when I tell you I was nervous about ordering fresh ceviche in Austin  I mean it  Soooooo good. Incredible service too...such an engaged staff  I thought it might be staged.   Our favorites were the triple enchiladas  holy mole  y all   and the beef fajitas...tender  juicy and plenty of red peppers and onions like we love. All I can say is we ll be back like nobody s business because for a place to knock it out of the park after being open for only two months  yes  we asked . I can t even with the live musicians...I had to include a video. Tip them. Bring cash. They were incredible.   Again...we will be back. Hopefully we can still get a table reserved like we did  because if this place keeps it up...it might become a problem soon    Well done.
Asadas Grill,13,I want to start by saying what excellent service we received from Marcos.  It was busy  but Marcos was friendly  helpful  and fast.  I liked how the waiters checked up on the tables that did not belong to them.  Jesus checked up on our table to see if we needed anything.  The food was delicious     We had the honor of meeting Don Lupe. He was checking up on the guests. We did not find out he was the owner till we asked out waiter who he was.  I highly recommend this place   
Asadas Grill,14,We really enjoyed our visit to Asadas Grill   They opened up recently in the old Zed s location  and if you didn t know it was there... you d miss it. You can t see it from the freeway but it shares a parking lot with JC Penney.    We decided to stop in for some drinks and appetizers in the middle of the afternoon. The drinks were a pleasant surprise.  There are the usual beer and margaritas  but they also have some interesting cocktails. Try them   Our favorite of the day was El Quita Cruda and the Flor de Puebla. We also tried a skinny margarita and a Mexican martini  both of which were also good   Hence you really can t go wrong  but we wanted to try some new things and you should too   We also had a sampling of appetizers  ceviche  shrimp with bacon and guacamole   All were goodbye the standouts here were the ceviche and shrimp  bacon appetizers.  Full of flavor   Also these dishes had more an interior Mexican flavor profile  not Tex Mex   When we sat down  they brought out some black bean nachos along with water. Very tasty   We sat on the back patio which is lovely and big   It wasn t crowded so there was plenty of space along with fans to keep air circulating.   All in all  we enjoyed our visit and will be back. Give it a try 
Asadas Grill,15,We got seated right away. Our waiter Marcos was excellent. My tacos de asada were amazingly tasty. The chamoy drink was excellent. The service was that of a high end steakhouse. Marcos took care of us but Jesus another waiter checked on us on two different occasion and then the owner Don Lupe stopped by to check on us too. Our drinks never dried dry and i cant rave enough about the service   The location was great and the view wonderful.
Asadas Grill,16,The place is beautiful and drinks are great.  Food is alright.. not the worst but not the greatest. My friend and I came on a Wednesday night and the server was completely unprofessional. He kept messing up our order and constantly forgetting what was asked. She ordered a specific meal and when the food came out they brought her something completely different. When she ask the server he said   oh sorry we ran out of your plate so we gave you this instead . Without even letting her know   His response  didn t want you to wait on your food  lol WTH. At the end  we didn t have to pay for that dish but she was not able to enjoy her meal. Totally uncalled for.
Asadas Grill,17,The Carne Asada is more than just grilled meat  it s also a social gathering. Think of it as a barbeque  but with a signature steak at the forefront. Asadas Grill takes inspiration from this Mexican tradition and applies it to their food. Grilled steak  open flame-grilled fish  grilled cheese  and more. I tried a few of these items and more such as   - Asada  12 oz   marinated flank steak - fun chewy texture and full of rich flavor.  24.95  4 5   - Huachinango Al Ajo  garlic-citrus marinated snapper with creamy chipotle sauce. Good assortment of flavors  very soft texture.  29.95  3.5 5   - Panela a Sada  grilled cheese with a blend of olive oil and herbs. Interesting texture  that has it slightly crispy on the outside  but soft on the inside. Pretty good   9.99  3.75 5   - Corn  a good side dish to complement whatever you get. Can t go wrong   3.75 5   - El Jefe  their signature margarita with flavors of orange juice  lime juice  and agave syrup. Great flavor  great portion  and quite strong.  10  4 5   - Strawberry Margarita  nothing special about this one  but still great  4 5   Overall  the food was good  but nothing here particularly stood out to me and the prices can be a bit steep. Glad I got to check the out and with that said  I give them a 3.5 5 for being good.
Asadas Grill,18,Great food and atmosphere  All around solid restaurant and you will not be disappointed
Asadas Grill,19,Service is lacking  but what restaurant in post-Covid times isn t  The steak fajitas are delicious and my go to order. Enchilada s are great too. Strong margaritas with a good happy hour to boot. I love the patio here and looking forward to cooler weather to enjoy it again.
Asadas Grill,20,I really love the spacious and semi open patio in this place.  Their Margaritas should be designated a national treasure  yes quantity and quality  in my opinion  server is always polite and respectful  I have been there 4-5 times  got Manny twice and he is awesome.  Food is pretty good.  The nicest surprise was the live music a couple of weekends ago.  It was pretty cool.  A   for their tacos and guacamole.  I also like that they are out of the way a bit so not as crazy as restaurants in the Domain or downtown.  I will definitely be returning.
Asadas Grill,21,The salad bar is the best thing about this place   The shrimp cocktail was really good and not sweet. I will be coming back for more 
Asadas Grill,22,Food was amazing and drinks were great. Also great service   Jesus was our server and he did a great job  
Asadas Grill,23,I made dinner reservation tonight and even though we were 30 minutes late  we were seated promptly. Restaurant inside was clean. We ordered one dozen Grilled Oysters  Asadas 10 oz grill  Caldo  Seafood soup   Carnitas Tacos  and kids meal burrito. Adadas entree came with either self-serve salad bar desserts or made to order one side. We chose to visit salad bar and grabbed fresh salad  tasted soup and scored some mini desserts. Food tastes ok  it reminds of Cancun Mexican restaurant dining. But the wait for food is too long.
Asadas Grill,24,Came for Father s Day  amp  hostess  bartender  amp  waiter were bad.  I guess Covid has given us bottom of the barrel service.  The food was bland  amp  the whole experience was disappointing.  Go to Lupe Tortilla instead.
Asadas Grill,25,Took my dad here for Father s Day. Our server was great  The drinks were great. The food was mediocre. Don t order the carne asada. The meat  was very chewy.
Asadas Grill,26,Friendly and prompt service  big good drinks  delicious steak fajitas. Fun ambiance especially on the porch  feels like you re somewhere on vacation. Would definitely go back 
Asadas Grill,27,The service was great.   Wait staff very attentive.  Restaurant was very clean.   Aesthetically pleasing decor.    Beautiful outdoor patio.   Tacos were well made.  Use a little more seasoning in the meat and beans and rice.   Overall good.   Will return.   Passion fruit mimosas were delicious.
Asadas Grill,28,I just came in on Sunday and love the place already  The view  the atmosphere  and the food are superb. The location was vacant for about 2 years and when this one opened  I just had to try it. Heard great things about it and with a good reason. I ordered the  carnitas tacos  and El Jefe drink  also  queso for appetizer and chocolate custard for dessert. They even had live spanish music with  trio  during dinner hours. However  I m not sure if it s only for the weekends. The place is super clean and the staff very friendly and accommodating.  I ll be coming here to try more things from the menu  I was very impressed with the quality of the food. The chicken and meat are very tender and moist. I m glad new places like this one are starting to open this year 
Asadas Grill,29,This place was UH-flippin-MAZING     The food was mouth watering and delicious    The drinks were fantastic  Highly recommend 
Asadas Grill,30,Food was terrible. You d think  19 shrimp tacos would be at least decent but they were disgusting. The cabbage on top was so vinegary and overpowering I couldn t even eat it  it was inedible. And the salsa on the side was the worst salsa I have ever tasted. Rice was bland. My husband got the steak and ordered medium but it came out well done. Food is WAYY overpriced for what it was. Will not be back.
Asadas Grill,31,I went in at 10pm on a Friday and waited at the reception area  like 3 people kept looking at me but nobody approached or greeted me. Eventually I asked someone if the bar area was still open and she told me that the entire restaurant was  closed at 10 even though It says 11 online and on their front sign.  They could have at least been nice about it. Being open during posted hours is like minimum expectation or like make a sign. I probably won t go back.
Asadas Grill,32,Nice atmosphere  great service and drinks were delicious  Food was bland and not authentic. Tortillas taste  store bought  and rubbery. The beef fajitas were tough and had no flavor.
Asadas Grill,33,I was really impressed with their food  it was delicious  The place is beautiful with an outdoor patio  waterfall alongside the building as you walk in and their decor is astonishing    I give a 4 star because we waited 45 minutes to 1 hour for the food when the restaurant wasn t packed. The restaurant was practically empty while the patio was full only. They also brought out the queso and chips out first as any appetizer would but they didn t bring the queso out only chips with two salsas.   I will still go again for a second time  let us pray it s a better experience with the service.
Asadas Grill,34,yeah  ok. finally tried this place. like  i wanna say it s basic  but it s not even. everything is really great from the weird black bean nachos they bring out to the yellow cheese queso. it s like a cliche  but it s a classic for a reason.   the bf got steak nachos and loved them. i m loving the tricolor enchiladas and regretting not getting something more creative. GUESS I GOTTA COME BACK. literally not even sad about it. this place is great.
Asadas Grill,35,The food is hit or miss at best. I eat here often  mostly because it s close  it s got a patio bar  and the bartenders are pretty solid. Most times there s no host staff and very little wait staff. The service so far has been good. The food is SO hit or miss that the bartender has offered to bring me something else multiple times. And once a Chile relleno in their torta came out un-fried with cold cheese in the middle and mgmt has yet to tell me what went wrong there. But it s just lunch right  And whoever is back there clearly doesn t care what s going out half the time. But this  Their street corn side hasn t been available for weeks  so they always default to rice and beans as a side. Today  I get charged extra for some reason  and now I m getting charged an extra buck because I don t use cash  I shouldn t be surprised  given that I asked for some jalapenos last week and got charged 2 freaking dollars for a ramekin of canned jalapenos. Like I get you rented a super fancy-looking place and with that comes some overhead. That s why i pay way too much for your mediocre food. But nickel and diming people on top of that is a crummy thing to do. Also the brunch buffet is 100  not worth  25. If you want a good Latin brunch buffet for less money go to El Meson on S. Lamar. Man  y all have a lovely space  an interesting salad soup dessert bar thingy  and some decent bartenders  but this is complete BS.
Asadas Grill,36,Friends invited us to try Asadas as we all love this location - the outdoor spaces are beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  Things start with a black bean and tortilla chip plate they bring everyone  which was surprisingly tasty. I do agree with other reviewers that they instead need to bring a basket of chips and salsa out. This is just something diners have come to expect when eating at a Mexican restaurant.   We all ordered cocktails and I d say it was a mixed bag. Some were good and some were just OK. The Pasion Caliente didn t seem to have an egg white in it and something just wasn t right with the Oaxaqueno. But the Oli Oli was delicious and the best drink of the night.  We ordered the queso and were all impressed with the flavors. It disappeared fast. My husband got the shrimp tacos  which were beautiful. I went with the chicken mole and it was full of cinnamon and spices and exactly what I wanted.  The service was friendly but sometimes spotty. We got sat inside and it was really pretty  but I would recommend sitting outside if at all possible. There was a band playing outside as we left  making the patio even more inviting.
Asadas Grill,37,Asadas Tacos todo muy rico  deCeviche  Grilled Steak amables todos los meseros  me gusta
Asadas Grill,38,Our family of four went to Asadas Grill Wednesday around 7 pm. i was hesitant due to some of the negative reviews here. But we were seated right away  carafe of cold water on the table with chips and 4 different dipping sauces on the table. Our order was taken right away after studying the menu. Daughter and I had house margaritas that were delicious  Son and husband had fajitas  daughter had beef fajitas tacos and I had shrimp tacos with a pasta side dish. It was all good  It was remarked that the fajita tacos offered more meat than the fajita plate. My shrimp were large and tasty.   We also had ceviche appetizer that husband really enjoyed. It s a beautiful restaurant and one we look forward to going back.
Asadas Grill,39,This place is mediocre at best. We decided to dine here after seeing the great reviews on open table rather than yelp. The drinks were actually pretty good but the food was lacking in flavor. The kids ordered cheeseburgers and Mac n cheese but didn t like either the burger or the pasta. We ordered the oysters  pollo de pipian  and tacos. I sent the pipian chicken back as it didn t taste anything like the description. Their rice was half cooked  the tortillas in the tacos were falling apart  in general  the food was not good. However  the wait staff was very nice and the drinks  el jeffe and asada martini  were good enough to warrant a 3 star rating.
Asadas Grill,40,Service is slow  rude  inattentive and dishonest. Food is bland and disappointing when compared to Monterrey and Mexico City  and overpriced. They also charge 3  to use a credit card  Non cash adj  which they don t disclose until your card is swiped and you re signing for it. I asked the server about the charge and he said  every restaurant charges it   which is NOT true  and that  it s posted on the front door   which also is not true because I checked on my way out. No courtesy to tell you upfront. Don t be fooled by the presentation. Never going back and I advise you to do the same.
Asadas Grill,41,Delicious interior Mexican cuisine  with a bit of TexMex on the menu too . Their patio dining was lovely. We were celebrating our anniversary so we were delighted with the live music. They apologized up front for being short staffed in the kitchen with several large parties but we found the service and pacing to be appropriate nonetheless. The enchiladas with mole sauce were delicious. The carne adada done medium rare was perfectly tender. They were out of esquites  Mexican Street corn  that night so I tried the poblano pasta  upscale Mac and cheese   which was delicious. The skinny margarita and El Jefe were both tasty and fresh. The chocolate custard dessert was a perfect ending to the meal. They forgot to serve my tortillas but graciously sent me home with some. We plan to return 
Asadas Grill,42,Walked in  the hostess was on the phone for over 12 minutes while my elderly 79-year-old mother  using her cane  stood there waiting. We finally had to sit down  and NO one else helped us. By the time we were sat  it was over 15 minutes. It s a struggle for her to walk  or we would have left and gone somewhere else. We finally got to order  and the seafood soup was so bland it was inedible. We told our waiter  he didn t seem to care. We won t be returning.
Asadas Grill,43,The food and drinks are really great  I m giving them 4 stars because I think they need to just conform to being a Texas restaurant and offer free chips and salsa. They give you a free bean appetizer which is like 4 chips with refried black beans and cheese  but I would pay for that in a plate of nachos  Stop messing around and just give us free chips and salsa   The 4 stars are definitely for their food. It is outstanding. Have loved everything I ve tried. The mole  the asada tacos  shrimp appetizer  ceviche  guac. It s all really fresh and tasty  I ve been there several times and the staff is friendly. They re still a little new so maybe not very outgoing yet.   Oh  in case you don t know...their location is amazing  Gorgeous patio that overlooks a greenbelt thingy. Places for kiddos to run around  supervised  there s water nearby  . And it s right next to HEB and Twin Liquors so you can grab some ingredients to keep the party going at your own place.  Try it out  But please  let s keep pushing for free chips and salsa.
Asadas Grill,44,This place has a great atmosphere and the food is good. The service is also great. We were really impressed with the place and planned to bring a big group back for a birthday dinner...until we got the check.  First of all  we had a group of about 10 people  so I understand that they usually automatically include the tip on the bill  though we all had separate checks . They included a 20  tip on our checks... which is high. In large groups I ve usually seen 18 . Personally I think they are cheating themselves when they do this because most people will tip more when given the choice  but when it s listed on the receipt with no option  they will just pay what is there and no more.  Second  they included a  no cash pay fee  of an additional 3 . Granted  it s not a lot of money but when they start nickel  amp  diming  it leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  So basically they charged us the credit card fee before they even knew if we were going to pay with a credit card. They included a total of 23  extra on the bill on top of the meal price.  Our party is not lacking in finances  but it rubbed us all the wrong way. It s not about the money. It just feels like we re being taken advantage of. So I hope those few extra dollars you squeezed out of us was worth it. We won t be back.
Asadas Grill,45,We were very excited to try this place   We walk in and it s empty   so we assume we will have great service  amp  food. The food was okay. The rice and beans were very good. Although the service was not the best. Our waiter was very inattentive  he didn t once ask if we needed refills. When our food was brought out he said he would bring us limes and never did. I asked for a refill and he took my cup to the back and never brought it back. Mind you were the only ones eating and another family. When the other family asked for extra stuff they received it immediately. Just confused on why we didn t receive the same treatment.
Asadas Grill,46,I came in looking for a nice bar  good margarita and a clean  light lunch and couldn t have been more pleased.  Carina was pleasant and attentive and the included salad desert spread was a welcome addition to the pollo asada.  Great presentation of chips and salsa too    Will be back 
Asadas Grill,47,Very comfortable atmosphere  spacious layout  tasty food  great drinks  and expansive  views off the back deck. We were there on a weekend and the live music was outstanding adding a festive element to the dinner.
Asadas Grill,48,Asadas is a lovely location with lots of light  open space inside and a lovely patio. Their frozen margaritas were excellent. The food was delicious and the staff is friendly. I went for the after brunch rush on Mother s Day and the staff was a bit like zombies - they got hit with a major rush  and the echo wave at 4pm was still hefty for them. I think they are still working out their personnel logistics - they had ample staff - but they were worn out. I will go back because overall  it was a great place and we enjoyed ourselves.
Asadas Grill,49,This was worth the trip. It was delicious   I ordered Enchiladas with  mole sauce.  The settings  beautiful. Nestled in green belts at Tech Ridge. The service was the best  these guys waited on me every minute. Oh yeah   They served  chips with black beans as a free appetizer. I would love to come back during the hours of entertainment.  I would recommend again and again. Thank you  Asada  what a wonderful birthday treat   
Asadas Grill,50,The quest is amazing but entrees are gross. It s called Asada so I got the carne asada tacos and it was disgusting. The hardest spineless meat. A hundred chews for one bite and then it s all stuck in your teeth. My friend got the enchiladas and they were bland. Beans bland. No flavor. Great quest though
Asadas Grill,51,Food and service are both really good here  A little on the pricer side than most other Mexican restaurants I like but the quality is definitely also better. It s also a cute little spot for date nights.
Asadas Grill,52,Disappointed with this place.  Things wrong with this place  1 Very immature  way too young staff servers. 2  Way too small food portion. 3  Food was ridiculously overpriced for the portion. 4 The staff does not represent the image that the restaurant is trying to represent.  5 Servers seems to not know what they are doing and are constantly huddled in a corner laughing and playing around.   Don t wast your time going to this place  You will leave feeling hungry and broke   What i liked  1 The patio was beautiful  2 The drinks were ok
Asadas Grill,53,The asada was delicious and so tasty  Comes with one side  but I ordered an extra one along with corn tortillas. Overall so good  amp  service was great
Asadas Grill,54,Honestly  just go to a Tex-mex.  Asadas lacks flavor.  Service was great  everyone was friendly and nice.  The food WILL kill this place. The  Mexican rice  was literally white  and tasted like nothing. Queso was but a spoonful deep  very disappointed.  Wait times for food were very off. 10 min for chips and salsa queso. Then about a min later entrees arrived. Make it make sense      It s almost as if they really don t know how to do it.   Will likely never return  and if you re thinking about it  just go somewhere else...
Asadas Grill,55,Margaritas are weak and food lacking in flavor. I had the Asada steak tacos which was ok. My husband had the enchiladas with mole sauce and it was not good.
Asadas Grill,56,I ate here a few weeks ago because I liked the previous place.  Nice location  cool vibe  great food and reasonable prices.  The menu has a few nice twists so it isn t the standard Mexican fare. The staff was fairly new and I think  like many other restaurants  they were having trouble hiring.  I m not sure why they only have 3 stars.  I think the people that rated them lowly were having a bad day or not informed about large party tipping policies.  If I were dating still this would be a good first date place.  I had a great 1000th date with my wife here.
Asadas Grill,57,Very overpriced.  I could have cooked this stuff up at home and come out just as good. Ordered medium well steak and got rare.  Sides were pathetic.
Asadas Grill,58,Food was excellent   The quality of Mexican staples comes down to the sauces.  Every one was great   tangy salsa verde  rich mole  and a warm seasonal pumpkin on my enchiladas.  Queso is unique and dynamic.  Great location  overlooking the creek.  Que sabroso 
Asadas Grill,59,Horrible expensive buffet. Food was old and tasted like it had been sitting for hours. Very greasy and old
Asadas Grill,60,The queso was straight up microwaved block cheese with some pico de gallo on top. It was terrible. The El Jefe drink was so strong I had to water it down. Highly do not recommend
Asadas Grill,61,Overall impression  nice patio  but the food isn t worth the price.   Ambiance   There is a beautiful patio. Sitting outside is definitely a must    Food   The food  however  was not super exciting. They offer a few chips covered in refried black beans as a free app with salsa. It was clear they had been sitting because our chips were soggy and the beans were cold. We would have preferred traditional chips and salsa. We did go for lunch  so we didn t get the main entrees they offer . We stuck with tacos. I got the asadas tacos and the asada was pretty good  the tortillas  homemade  were the best part. My partner got the pastor tacos and they were salty. Almost inedible  They have a salad bar that looked pretty nice  but we didn t partake. I got a side of seasonal vegetables and couldn t eat them. They were incredibly greasy and was essentially a giant tomato thrown on a grill with half cooked zucchini. The food was pricey too  Taco plates were  15 - it came with 3 tacos  green sauce  and a side of your choosing  rice  veggies etc   Drinks   The have a giant mezcal selection. We got some of their specialty cocktails. Boy was it expensive for what it was. I couldn t even finish mine because I didn t like the taste.   Cost  After two drinks and mediocre tacos  we paid  65. Crazy to us    Service   Host was friendly and seated us immediately. They were apparently short staffed  because our experience after that was not great. We had 3 people take our drink order at different times and it took around 15 minutes to receive them. We then ordered food with a person who we were told was our waiter. Food came out quickly. No one checked in during our meal and then trying to get the check was a nightmare. Our waiter was not around  so we asked another staff member. She seemed to have forgotten and our waiter came back  so we asked him. He totally forgot and 10-15 minutes pass and we had to ask someone else for the check. We finally got it  but a wait that long for the check seemed bizarre.
Asadas Grill,62,We came in for lunch on a Wednesday  and when we walked in there was no host so we stood there for about 10 minutes waiting to be sat  After we got to our table we waited an extra 20 minutes before our server even brought us water  we ordered a couple cocktails and proceeded to wait an extra 20 minutes for drinks  the whole time the server did not come back to take our order so we ended up not even ordering anything. I would not come here unless you want to wait over an hour for food  
Asadas Grill,63,Well to start off I was very excited that something was finally at the old Zedds. After that it s all bad. Waking in I was chastised by the manager asking why I didn t have a reservation. They sat my girlfriend and I at a very open bar. Took 27 min to get a drink. And now I have sat here 39 minutes waiting to order. At this point I just stopped wanting to be here. Also it was a hassle trying to ever get the check for our 1 drink each. I was literally held hostage cause I wanted to pay my bill. Maybe I will come by at a different time. It s horrible service and nobody knows what they are doing at all. Let me know when y all are really ready to open.
Asadas Grill,64,It was good. Nothing out of the ordinary but adequate for Mexican food. Staff was alright. The presentation was definitely great for the food and the place itself was nice. Would maybe come back but would rather try other places.
Asadas Grill,65,The food is the reason for not returning  ordered a well done steak and was wayy too dry  the shrimp cocktail was not good at all  neither the calabazitas enchiladas  not to mention only one side comes with the plate. The rice was uncooked. The place was pretty and employees were nice though.
Asadas Grill,66,We went to Asadas for the fist time for lunch and EVERYTHING was fabulous   The food was excellent and the service was  perfect . My husband and I eat out at least 4 times a week  and almost once each week at Gloria s  and the food was just as good  or better. We will definitely be going back and bring friends to show off this new  to us  place We will also be going back on a weekend to experience the live music that we heard about today. We couldn t be more pleased than to find this gem so close to our house  with plenty of easy parking  
Asadas Grill,67,The first time the we when there it was good maybe 8 months a go this time I what to go there with my son visiting from Dallas he was looking for a good Mexican restaurant  surprise the food was sooooo nada the meet was so hard to chewing  dry bad pieces from steak meet for tacos  my son have a fajitas the same the meet dry no juice and cool he left all we take couple pieces for the dog and what happen not even the dog eat he left in the plate the other plates the good very cool  if you respect your self don t go there is your money in the trashl
Asadas Grill,68,Came here for dinner and loved it  Jesus was so attentive and making sure we were good throughout the whole night  Will for sure come back
Asadas Grill,69,Supper nice place. All the employees were welcoming. The food and drinks were awesome. We had a party of 15 and the waiter didn t miss a beat. Drinks  appetizers and food was all brought out quickly. First time visit definitely going back.
Asadas Grill,70,I really liked this place  and I would actually probably give them a 4.5 if I could. I am a sucker for ambiance  and this place nails it. The restaurant and bar area are beautiful  with plenty of space inside and out. There was a musician playing on the patio  which conflicted a bit with the inside ambient music  but it still made me want to dance. The service was excellent. I appreciated the huge size of the El Jefe margarita as well. It was delicious and refreshing. My favorite thing about this restaurant is their vegetarian selections. There were four very different dishes on offer  which is about four more than most places. I had the mushroom tacos  which were served with refried beans. They bring you three tacos  which was more than enough for me. Everything was fresh and flavorful - especially the tortillas. In addition  the restaurant offers a salad bar with lots of options - but a truly unique salad bar. I always appreciate a restaurant that doesn t just relegate vegetarians to salads and sides. It is clear that the management at this place really cares about offering quality options to those of us who can t eat meat. A massive thank you for your thoughtfulness in this category of food  and for the great experience. We will definitely be back.
Asadas Grill,71,The FOOD is delicious and sure are the Margarita s. I had the Green Chile Verde  Enchiladas.    They were absolutely delicious.  Service was as expected.  The Bartender was exceptional.    I sat at the Bar on a Sunday afternoon     I will come back    absoutely
Asadas Grill,72,Asadas is such a gem in our neighborhood. In a part of town that is overcrowded with boring chain restaurants  Asadas stands apart. I ve ordered several different dishes  invited different groups of friends  and it s always a hit. Love the cocktail menu as well. One of the things I love most is the outdoor patio. Even on hot days  it s pleasant to sit out there because of the great cover and giant fans. Go here 
Asadas Grill,73,This is a most excellent Mexican food restaurante. My family ate there two days ago and everyone s food was great  The appetizer was great  What I am trying to say is the food is very good. We went on a fluke because a server from a place nearby we went to that was too noisy recommended it to us.   The atmosphere is very nice inside with soft music and a majority hispanic staff adds to the authenticity of the experience. I can t wait to go back and try some of the other menu items. This is a MUST TRY if you like Mexican food.
Asadas Grill,74,Very very poor brunch experience  Insufficient staff and brunch food was lacking in quantity  variety  and freshness. There were actually no egg choice s  at all in their brunch assembly and just poorly stocked with about half of their options being totally empty for a good while.  Although we ended up ordering a la carte  my toddler went with the buffet option just to make sure he got some food in near future so I was monitoring the buffet line considering it for awhile since ordering drinks food took over 20 mins after we got sat  drinks alone . Our bartender was sweet and just seemed very busy not really a server so she did the best she could given the situation. Our drinks  margarita and Paloma  were mediocre  chicken mole sauce was the only good thing we basically tried since the shrimp tacos were very much lacking flavor and made up of two shrimp each  tail-on shrimp to make it worse in a taco . I wish the  lado  bar would ve been better but nothing beyond basic salad with ranch  macaroni potato salad  and unfortunately salty menudo. The best thing there were probably cheese cubes and maybe margarita pie. Really really wanted to love this place and had set my expectations high but they need A LOT of work  Ambiance has good potential but not enough to make me come back anytime soon. I d steer clear of here for awhile and hope they can get their act together before going out of business especially during these weird times...
Asadas Grill,75,Great service staff. The food and drinks are mid  but the vibe coupled with the staffs aim to please makes this place so great. Plus it s much cheaper than I expected it to be walking In.
Asadas Grill,76,Very expensive food  I don t know what makes them think that having a  fancy  looking restaurant and nice plates  they can put higher prices on their food  plus they charge you a percentage to use your credit card. If I could give it a zero I would  never going back again    
Asadas Grill,77,Beautiful place with nice patio but not so much the food. Food lacks flavor. It s a perfect place to drink and chill.
Asadas Grill,78,This was a surprise  The outside is beautiful. It s the old Zed s location. The food was excellent snd the service was great  Our drinks were perfect  The salad bar is awesome with lots of choices. Sorry I didn t come here sooner.
Asadas Grill,79,OMG    This is  literally  one of the best restaurants in Austin    I have been a faithful follower of Casa Chapala for nearly 16 years  but this is that restaurant on steroids  SERIOUSLY  Their chips and salsa...AMAZING   especially the creamy jalape o salsa. For my first meal at my new favorite consisted of cheese enchiladas with Verde sauce...let me just say...MAGICAL  If you want to try something new and you are in the mood for Mexican fare  you d be super silly not to visit. Come  Enjoy  Let your taste buds do a happy dance   
Asadas Grill,80,So excited to have such a lovely dining experience close to home. Outside landscaping and architecture is beautiful. Queso and salsas were awesome as were the chips. Refreshing change of pace  elevated flavor than the norm. The menu items were creative and delicious. Little things like the sauces they ve crafted and even just how juicy and delicious the simplest thing like chicken is. I got the pumpkin sauce enchiladas. The margs are real drinks. Balanced and not all puckering and heart-burny like you may be accustomed to. Service was attentive and kind. I wish the inside aesthetic was quite as beautiful as outside  but it s close. It s mostly the furniture that takes it down a notch from the finer dining that it could be. We could not be more delighted to have them in town and hope to hit up that outdoor bar soon 
Asadas Grill,81,I really wanted to like this place  I heard about their happy hour and was excited to check it out. We ordered two Mexican Martini s and their Queso. We got the Queso first and we had it mostly finished by the time we got out martinis. When we got the martinis they were not very cold  almost room temp  but the flavor was good. We ordered the Nachos with steak and the Chile Relleno Torta. This is where the disappointment came in  the nachos were in a can and served by the waiter. This would have been fine  but they were cold and soggy. They definitely tasted like they had been sitting for a bit. The Torta was also disappointing. The Chile relleno was described on the menu as deep fried and filled with cheese. If there was cheese  we couldn t find it. The rest of the sandwich was bland. It had a black bean spread with tomato  onion and lettuce. After we finished out Mexican Martinis we got the House Margarita on the rocks. This was the worst part of the meal. I tasted it and immediately thought it tastes watered down but I didn t say anything to my husband because I thought it might be just mine. When he tasted his he said the exact same thing and added that it tasted like water. All in all our tab came out to  60 during happy hour before tip  queso  nachos and drinks were on happy hour  and we left very disappointed.
Asadas Grill,82,I took my sister here today to celebrate her birthday and we were outside. Our waitress greeted us but didn t introduce herself she was kind stand offish.She gave my sister a weird look when she ordered her alcoholic beverage. After we ordered our food she didn t come and check up on us as we were eating out appetizer But as soon other ppl came and sat out in the patio she was being very attentive and holding a conversation etc. when our food came we noticed we weren t given eating utensils like the others around us so when our waitress finally came by my sister asked her if we could have some forks and she rolled her eyes while sighing just had an attitude and handed us the eating utensils like it was a chore. When she handed a couple who was seated at a table close to us the waitress was very attentive and kind to them when she was handing them their food and it was the same for another group behind where I was sitting. We were the only black ppl there and we were treated poorly compared to the people around us. I am really upset about this because I was so excited to take my sister here and we ended up having a bad experience. Keep in mind we were very civil and we weren t rude both of us were in a good mood when we came here. On my receipt it says our waitresses name is Nancy.
