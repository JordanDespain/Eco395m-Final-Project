T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,1,My favorite hot dogs in Austin.   A pleasant  shady place with a fan to enjoy them.   Always friendly service.   And we are offered some seriously yummy options. Check the menu       Parking can sometimes be a problem but it s worth the try.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,2,Delicious hot dogs and burritos. The highlight is the tortillas- i dont know if they make in house but they are thin and delicious making a fantastic burrito. The meat is well seasoned and cooked  and the queso is top notch.  The hot dogs are great  they are a great version of a  danger dog  or  dirt dog  for anyone familiar with the los angeles staple street food. They are far from your typical dog- with onions  peppers  cheese  etc.- delicious.  Highly recommend a visit 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,3,Well  first of all the owners are great   Zulma greeted us warmly and chatted with us. Miguel  the chef  came out of the trailer to talk the menu over with us  I would not expect this at their busy times  . So the service was above good  it was great  And the food -- oh my god   Miguel is a real chef  far above what you might expect from a food trailer operator. My wife and I split a Sonoran  and it was incredibly good  Delicious bun  filled with toppings  just all around delicious. We also split a chicken taco and a cheese taco  happened to be vegetarian . Both were excellent. By the way  we drove some 20 miles from our house to go visit T-Loc   and it was totally worth it. We ll do it again the next time we want some delicious food. Totally recommend    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,4,Was in the mood for a hot dog and got to try my first Sonora Dog at T-Loc s.   The Sonora dog is loaded  but the one I had at T-Loc s felt short of expectation. I didn t taste much in the way of bacon or pinto beans  which are the two twoppings that set the Sonora dog from all other dogs. Also  the stnadard hot dog that T-Loc uses sdoesn t have much spicy zing or snap in the casing. They offer dogs from Hebrew  National and Granzin s Market for  1 and  1.50 more  respectively. I would strongly recommend getting them  but it d be even better if T-Loc s were to raise its price and make the Hebrew National dog standard.  However  I really liked the Fresco dog  topped with mashed avocado  sliced cucumber  and pico de gallo. Perfect for endless weeks of 98  degree evenigns in Austin. The different  and more subtle  flavors in the Fresco dog worked better than the Sonora dog  I thought. The steamed bun  sourced from Alejandro s Tortilla Factory in Tuscon was top-notch and held everything together. Also appreciated Chef Miguel for taking the time to chat with me and telling me more about the business.  Overall  definitely worth a visit. Make sure you get one of the non-standard hot dogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,5,Why 5 stars  Because when hot dogs are done well  they really hit the spot.             Hot dogs are kind of the butt of the joke in the food world  but a fancy hot dog is one of my favorite meals. And T-Loc s serves up some fancy hot dogs.  Pretty much all of them sounded good  so it was painful to only choose two  but I ultimately went with the Yaqui and the La Sonora.   The Yaqui was everything I hoped for when I decided to come here. The bun was toasted and delicious. The toppings smothered the dog itself  beans  onion  steak and cheese. Every bite was a dream.  To be honest  the La Sonora was a bit of a miss for me. It was basically a birria taco in hot dog form. But the flavor was just a bit off from every birria taco I ve tried to date. I didn t hate it  but the other dog was definitely my favorite.  I also ordered some ranch fries  which were an ideal pairing with the hot dogs. They were heavy  which prompted the owners to question if I was going to be able to eat everything by myself  but I told them I had the heart of a champion and I finished every last bite. The ranch fries were fries covered in ranch  bacon  cheese and onions  which was as great as it sounds like it would be.  In my brief chat with the owner s   they were really nice people and hoping to open a brick and mortar location soon. Hopefully that will happen and I can swing by to check it out next time I m in Austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,6,Summary  I love this place. The hotdogs are incredible and the owning family is kind and friendly. I have never had a bad experience here. Recently moved from Austin  and it will be one place I genuinely miss.   Good  Gotta go  con todo . Hot  cold  sweet  salty  savory  ...  it s got it all. And 1 is usually enough for me  and I m a pretty big guy. Love their ranch fries as well.   Bad  Outdoor seating is nice  but the truck area has flies and bugs.  Ugly  Nothing to note 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,7,The Sonoran Style Hot Dog is quite  frankly  one of the best hot dogs that I ve ever had. Miguel and Zulma  the owners  were explaining their origin  story as we were placing the order at the food truck. They are from Arizona and trying to bring Tuscon style hot-dogs to Austin.   Get the Sonora Hot Dog  It really combines  salty  spicy  sweet so well. It consists of a hot dog that is wrapped in bacon and grilled  served on a bolillo-style hot dog bun  and topped with pinto beans  onions  tomatoes  and a variety of additional condiments  often including mayonnaise  mustard  and jalape o salsa.  SO GOOD. It comes with roasted chili pepper and some chips.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,8,This place never disappoints  Very welcoming atmosphere. The owners are very nice and proud of their business. The Agua Frescas  strawberry orange specifically   .COM  but all are really good. Food so good made me think about them all week til I went again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,9,These guys are my fav hot dogs in the whole city.   I dont think they have anything on the menu here that isnt just the best. From the Carne Asada Fries to the Sonoran Style hot dogs you just cant go wrong. Even the Tacos are legit -af.   If youre in the mood for something special and want a hot dog this is the place. Youre not going to have a better hot dog experience anywhere in the city.   Dont skip. T-Loc knows whats up.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,10,Let s be frank... these dogs ain t no joke   Highlights   Carne Asada Fries   Sonoran Style Hotdogs   Aguas Frescas   Review  This has become my new lunch spot which is conveniently close to work. I order the Yaqui Dog  carne asada fries and an agua fresca.  The Yaqui Dog was a rollercoaster of flavor with notes of sweetness from the saut ed onions  smokiness from the carne asada  nuttiness from the pinto beans  fattiness from the bacon wrapped hot dog  creaminess from the cheese and slight acidity to complement everything from the jalape o sauce. The highlight however were the carne asada fries  they had the perfect amount of asada  fries were cooked perfectly  creaminess from the crema added depth  freshness from the pico and the pickled garnish just took it to the next level. Everything was delicious and it was all washed down with a refreshing agua fresca. Can t wait to go back for another lunch adventure.   Rating  10 10  Yaqui Dog Bacon-wrapped S-Bar hot dog  pinto beans  sauteed onions  carne asada  Monterrey Jack cheese   amp  jalape o sauce. Served with chips. Chile guero available on request  Carne Asada Fries Crinkle cut fries  1 4lb of carne asada  pico de Gallo  mexican crema  japale o drizzle  monterrey jack cheese  amp  garnish
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,11,Hot dog  This place is tucked in at the 5000 Burnet food truck park. Been here several times over the years and they re consistently delicious  I ve tried almost everything on the menu  but tried and true is their Sonoran hot dog con todo. It has their bacon-wrapped dog  pinto beans  tomatoes  onions  mayo  mustard and jalapeno sauce. Sounds like a lot  but the flavors work so well together. The couple that owns the truck are super friendly. Pro tip  ask for the guero pepper. It s not super spicy but it s a delicious grilled pepper with salt sprinkled on it. Adds a nice dimension when you eat it with your hot dog. If you re a fan of Sonoran hot dogs or curious  stop in at T-Loc s 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,12,I know you see hotdog in the menu and think nothing can be amazing here but you re dead wrong. This is one of the greatest hotdogs spots as well as taco burrito they go all in on flavor. Nothing here is basic it s made with passion and quality ingredients stacked up to give you a mouth punch of flavor. Staff here is amazing ownership is passionate and wants to give you the best and by the way they are award-winning yes is a must try. Then you will just keep going back wake me see you soon 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,13,Okay wow talk about a yummy hot dog  Tried this once when my family was in town and have been back a few times since then  I really enjoy the flavors of their sonoran hot dig  though will say this is a better experience eating there. When I did pickup  it was a bit longer of a wait since I had to drive which left the bottom of the bun a bit soggy. Also really loved their carne asada burrito  10 10 would recommend  and everyone that works there is super nice too
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,14,A few months ago Way South Philly closed.  Being from Philly a quarterly visit will be missed.  Luckily I have found a new go to spot in T-Loc s.   The Sonoran dog is out of this world.   This dog hits all parts of the taste spectrum.  Outstanding.   Also the fries with the Aioli made me weak in the knees and broke my no fry diet.   It was worth it.   The owner has a great background having spent his childhood in Hawaii and loved to surf.  I really enjoyed talking to him.   The burrito is probably worth a try on another day.  It will be hard to order with the option of a Sonora.   Maybe I need to starve myself for a day and get both.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,15,This place is a food truck located in a parking lot with a bunch of other very tasty food trucks  too  They have their own seating right next to the truck  which is also lit at night  super convenient.  As for the Sonoran dog.. just get it. It is 100x better than the ones I ve tried in Tucson  where they re apparently very popular . Everything just tastes fresher and is more neatly put together than I remember having before. Nothing negative to say about it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,16,The hot dog definitely tasted special with the toasted bun  amp  fillings galore  but not mind-blowing or anything. I loved the pepper on the side. It definitely added some heat to every bite.   Also ordered the tacos a la plancha. Two small-sized tacos with corn tortillas. It came with beans and cabbage slaw. The beef inside was nicely grilled charred. Tortillas were also fresh and toasty. But yeah it s more like a snack than a meal.  Will try other items next time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,17,Truly I wasn t sure if I wanted a hog dog to start... BUT these are so GOOD. I got the Sonoran hot dog and Ranch fries. The hot dog was so yummy and flavorful. The ranch fries were definitely shareable and once again so flavorful.  Also the owner came by and was so friendly. Big thumbs up from myself and my friends.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,18,Revisited T-Loc s and he s still delivering the goods  Try them out for an out-of-this-world hot dog experience 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,19,My son brought me here. I had the Sonoran dog with everything and had some of the carne asada fries too  The Agua Fresca was very refreshing on a hot day in Austin. Everything was wonderful   Highly recommend . Go check this food truck out   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,20,A must if you re in austin  Love the food  You cant go wrong with anything. Been here several times and will continue to  Owner is very welcoming 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,21,BEST HOTDOGS IN AUSTIN        I hope that was loud enough. Because it s true.   T-Locs sports the most meticulously crafted hotdogs in Austin. They re main attraction  the Sonora Hot Dog  is absolutely  the epidemy of hotdogs. Soft steamed bun  the actual dog itself smothered in a wide range of ingredients that compliment each other in this extraordinary chorus of hotdog universe.  Not only do they have amazing hot dogs but they re sides are just as great. My fav side to pair with a hot dog is the ranch fries. Again  a collection of so many different ingredients to form an amazing basket of fries.   Service is amazing with the chef duo cranking out orders with care and love.   An amazing place  a must try in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,22,I love this crap  It tastes really good  Especially the hot dogs  The chicken burritos are really good too  Thanks
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,23,Deliciousness    Bacon Wrapped Dog  amp  carne asada fries were so good                    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,24,We got the Sonoran hot dog without the pinto beans and it was soooo good    I had the agua fresca it was strawberry and orange. It was so refreshing and good. It wasn t too sweet or sour it was just perfect  The fries were very crispy and a big serving enough for two. 10 10
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,25,Do it   Support local   You won t regret it  This little hot dog burrito french fries with garlic aioli place is awesome....o  M gosh.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,26,Been craving a good hot dog. Was not disappointed. Solid Sonoran dog was on point. Their papas Bravas were just the right side. Plenty of parking and night lights offer a good spot to catch a late dinner.   Coming back for the carne asada fries
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,27,I DON T EVEN KNOW  WHAT   WHO   The hot dog I had  was way to good to share. So I didn t. The carne asada fries looked good enough to snatch from my boyfriend  so I did  All the food we got was mouth watering. The food was not overly seasoned  I genuinely didn t feel bloated or felt sleepy when you eat cheesy goodness  instead I felt like I was missing a cold beer. I can not recommend the food enough  we re going back to try the entire menu. The only thing we forgot to do is take a picture of the quesadilla and that s mostly because we had finished the entire thing before we could  but the cheese pull... money shots all around  the food taste as fantastic as it looks  Great place  lots of places to sit and the vibe was awesome
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,28,Great Sonoran Dog and Carne Asada Tacos. Will be back to try other things on the menu. Staff were very friendly and gave me good insight on the inspiration of their menu ingredients.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,29,Amazing. Every single time. Whoever makes The Sonora dip is doing gods work. The fries are necessary y agua Fresca
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,30,Friendly chef   Thank you  Tastes so good and flavorful  hope set up  2 in downtown of Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,31,They are from Tucson  AZ and we used to live there when my hubby was stationed there in the Air Force. We found out about this place when my hubby was craving carne asada burritos - we are originally from San Diego where they have the best carne asada burritos. Ordered the carne asada burritos the first time we went and that was back in 2019 - taste just like the ones in San Diego - delicious  Miguel and his wife always take the time to talk to us when they re not busy and the food never disappoints. When family comes to visit from San Diego  we take them there and they agree that it s as good as the carne asada burritos in San Diego.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,32,This place is a favorite of mine.  Even though the husband and wife team that lovingly run this place are from Tucson  they placed in the Great ATX El Paso Mexican Food Challenge before Covid hit.  The Sonora Dogs are unbelievably good  but I had the opportunity to see their catering chops this Cinco de Mayo.   Drowned Taquitos Ala El Paso  are around 20 to 50x better than Chicos.  I ate several sober and wanted more  something I ve never been able to claim about Chico s.  Either at their trailer on Burnet or catering your next affair  I love T-Loc... both food and family.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,33,Got 2 Sonoran dogs. They were really good but neither dog was wrapped in bacon. Bummer.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,34,I think it s refreshing to see a product advertise and for once it is actually exactly as advertised and as you see in the photos  Having lived in Arizona and have had Sonoran hotdogs there I would say these are as authentic as they get  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu  Ah and the owner operator was very personable so that makes the whole experience that much better.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,35,Super friendly and funny owners  The main Sonoran hot dog is the best  The perfect balance of flavors. You guys are awesome  and your awards have definitely been earned.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,36,This place makes legit Sonoran Hot Dogs. Bacon wrapped dogs with jalapeno  mayo  mustard and beans. The cinnamon infused bread buns are shipped in from a bakery in Tucson  AZ. If you have never tried a Sonoran hot dog  you need to come here. Come with your friends and order a dozen of them. Make it a celebration to life 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,37,Every time I m missing home I make my way to T-Loc s. The Sonora Dog is AMAZING  Best food truck in Austin by far 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,38,Absolutely astounding hotdog. Would heavily encourage anyone to try it. Amazing service  remarkably delicious hotdogs. Love the cheese  jalape o sauce  seasoning  bacon  everything. 5 5
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,39,Great hotdogs. Great service. Great people. Highly recommend to anyone looking for amazing food with amazing people to brighten up your day. WILL be making this a frequent meal.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,40,Simplemente los mejores. Los due os tienen la mejor vibra siempre que voy me hacen sentir como familia. Y la comida ni se diga. 10 10
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,41,Super tasty dog.  Not a sausage on crusty bun with mustard.  Instead an amazing mix of ingredients.  Bacon wrapped dog on a soft squishy steamed bun with a pile of messy ingredients on top.  Beans.  Tomatoes.  Onions.  And then three sauces.  Might drip on you while eating so take care.  They also have tacos and burritos but I ve only ever had the Sonoran dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,42,Absolutely amazing   True authentic Sonoran hotdogs. If you re from Arizona and miss a slice of home then this is a MUST stop for you. We ordered two Sonoran dogs with a carne asana burrito. Authentic carne burrito with just meat  pico  and guac. Customer service was too notch  we met and talked with the owner for a bit  you can tell he s passionate about what he does. We will be repeat customers.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,43,My husband loves their Sonoran dogs but I am all about the ranch fries. The dill in the ranch sauce makes them crazy tasty. Burritos and tacos are solid and they have really good tortillas. Convenient order ahead options online w pickup at the truck  if you don t want to wait there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,44,I love their hot dog  Upgrade to the Hebrew National bc it really does make a difference. They ve added a bunch of stuff to their menu in recent years  so if you haven t been in a while  you should go  go  go again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,45,I ve been here about 5 times and every single time has been incredible. The owners are very kind and seem to know everyone by name  you can tell they care about their customers as much as their food. As much as I d like to recommend something specific  you really can t go wrong with anything 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,46,OMG the carne asada plate is the stuff dreams are made of. The line can get long but the wait is absolutely worth it. The hotdogs are amazing as well but the care asada is where it s at 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,47,We stopped by after a few years not coming due to distance. I looked at our last review which was the first time we ever came here in 2014.The place has changed.They added tables umbrellas decorations. Looks great   time has passed and we change .Could not remember what the female owner has a unique name.We come to the window  lady walks away does not say one moment to us. Comes back to window My husband says hi the friendly person that he is.Her response was a huh or something. My husband said does Sulma still work here she sarcastically said yes I live here.Come to find out 7 yrs have gone by we change you changed.Did not mean no disrespect.My husband said my wife has been wanting a CA burrito  I kept telling her this place may have it.We stopped by Sulema sarcastically said she don t need to come you could have came I don t know about her but she can you know. I was shocked of the unfriendly service we experienced and rudest as we were one of her first reviews and promoted by mouth. We love supporting small businesses. I get it you may be stressed as you were busy today when we came.However  our experience was very disappointing.I wish reviews could have the stars seperated. My rating is based off her rudeness. I guess we expected her same kindness we recieved in 2014.We have come many times before and there was no need for another review she has alwys been respectful.The food as always excellent .Shocked is all.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,48,A bit pricy but worth the flavor. My go tos are usually the Sonora and the Yaqui dog with their agua fresca. I didn t think I would get full with just two hot dogs but they fill them up with all the works  beans cheese  salsa  bacon  that it definitely fills you up. If you re craving something new or some hot dogs you have to give these Sonoran dogs a try. You won t regret it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,49,I AM OBSESSED  Best food truck in atx  The service is great the food is delicious  . Love this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,50,Amazing food - highly recommend everything on the menu. The flavors are amazing and the tortillas are super fresh. I have had the burritos  plates and tacos and nothing has missed. Super nice owners and great vibes.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,51,This is my buddy s favorite place to eat in Austin. So of course  I had to try it  And man was I blown away. I ve had bacon-wrapped hot dogs before. But this was a whole nother level. The toppings added so much extra flavor. But the real game changer here was the bun. Not only was the bun soft and sweet  it was strong enough to hold everything on the whole time. Nothing fell off whenever I took a bite.  This was my last going out meal before quarantine started and you best believe it will be my first when quarantine is over 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,52,I am obsessed with their hot dogs   Specially the Chile g eros they have. My favorite is their Sonoran hot dog. This is definitely a place I can eat every day at.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,53,Yes  yes and more yes. The only place I know where you can get authentic and delicious Sonoran style Mexican food. I miss these Arizona style burritos more than anything...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,54,If I could give this place all the stars in the world I would. The people that work there are as amazing as the food. Definitely one of my favorite places in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,55,We knew we wanted to try this place the first time we visited the Food Truck park. And  today was the day for T-Loc s. We all went Sonoran style and  WOW  firm believer in doing it the way the chef intends at least on the first round. Perfection  That bun  the crispy dog  fresh toppings... the jalape o sauce... and the aioli on the fries... fresh  not your ordinary hot dog.. plus we got to hear a little about the origins of the cuisine... great experience and we will be back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,56,As a Tucson local who just moved to Austin  TX  I was craving a good spot of Sonoran Mexican food. That craving was satisfied by T Loc s  Their carne asada tacos were amazing and very authentic  the Sonoran hot dogs were incredible and I couldn t recommend this food truck more 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,57,This is just one of those spots. IYKYK  Their hot dogs are phenomenal you just can t go wrong. Their ranch fries are also great so don t sleep on them like I did on my first visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,58,The Sonoran hot dog is great  The burritos and fries are also very good. Lots of flavor. The folks running the truck are very attentive.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,59,Truly authentic Sonoran Hot dogs  great tasting  lots of flavor. Staff was very friendly and attentive  place is very clean...but best of all great tasting food. Better than Gueros.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,60,T-locs is by far my favorite food truck in Austin  They ve got the best hot dogs  The buns are delicious  the sausage is wrapped with bacon  and don t get me started on the caramelos  it s like a quesadilla but much tastier . The people working the food truck are really friendly.  Unfortunately they re closed on Sundays.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,61,Everything we ordered was delicious  T-Loc s did not disappoint. The hot dog definitely lives up to the hype. I ve never had anything like it. I usually don t enjoy hot dogs but this one is on a whole  nother level. I would recommend upgrading the hot dog from the Bar S or else the hot dog meat will get overpowered by the other flavors which isn t necessarily a bad thing at all  I guess it s just what you prefer. The carne asada fries also tied for favorite dish. The spicy pickled carrots and jalape os are an excellent touch. The torta and the taco were also excellent. I recommend trying one of everything tbh  The customer service is on point too. Everyone seems to love what they do there. This place has a very welcoming feeling to it. I can t wait to come back and try the rest of the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,62,Friendly folks.  Good hot dogs.  I usually get the ones with everything.  I go during the week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,63,Yummy    Didn t think I would like mayonnaise on a hot dog but this was awesome   Great customer service 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,64,I m not sure why I haven t reviewed this place yet - the sonoran-style hot dog here is amazing  and it s better not just than other hot  dogs  which aren t many to be honest   but to most sandwiches and burgers in general.   It has a complex flavor and texture  which again is particularly impressive since it s a hod dog. It s fresh and creamy and meaty and toasty.  One thing I will note - I also recently went again and tried the burrito  and while it was pretty good  it was nowhere near as good as the amazing hot dog so I would recommend just getting those when you come  more than 1 if you want a bigger meal.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,65,The bun makes the hot dog. It s crispy and gives it a crunch. I love all the sauces they drizzle on the hotdog too and all the onions tomatoes.   It s a bit messy  so don t come on a first date.    Overall it s good  but I was expecting the sausage itself to be more unique.   I m torn between giving them 3 or 4 stars. It s hard for a hotdog to blow my mind.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,66,Love their Sonora style hotdogs.. The carne asada burrito is also great and it s the best burrito in Austin.     Mike and Zulma are really nice  friendly and even gave our pup a treat     When we had friends or family visiting from Cali I would take them to T- Locs.   If you re in Austin go check them out  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,67,This great little food truck right off of Burnet Road has some of the best hotdogs you will ever taste in your life  They also have super fast and friendly service. The hotdog bun was probably the best hotdog bun I ve ever tasted  and I understand they are flown in a couple of times a week from Tucson. You won t go wrong with a visit to this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,68,One of the best veggie hot dogs period. We ordered just 1 first and than before finishing it we had second one already being ordered which tells how much we liked it. Heard a lot of good reviews about them and this one lived out to the expectation. People who work here are also very kind and friendly. The cheese tacos were also good but beware of the side grilled
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,69,The best hot dogs in Austin bar none....we are repeat customers and it always a treat to be able to there.  You have to get a Sonora dog - all the way and a yaky.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,70,When you think of hot dogs  backyard barbecues and New York come to mind. Well  consider T-Loc s a part of that image now   I ordered the Veggie Sonoran Dog and the biggest difference is it s not bacon-wrapped and it s vegenaise instead of mayo. The most impressive part of the hot dog is the bun - perfectly toasted while still being light and airy. This is a seriously loaded hot dog  in the best way possible  so it feels like you get a new bite every time.   And their Chicken and Cheese Quesadilla was seriously one of the best quesadillas I ve ever eaten  The tortilla was beautiful looking and tasting because of the flattop they re cooking it on  something you can never exactly replicate at home .   I think the price for quality and quantity of food is great. The owners were friendly and my order didn t take too long to be ready.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,71,I want to talk soccer  but I don t wanna BORE HER I wanna go to sleep  but I still wanna EXPLORE HER I have to make sure that I don t come BEFORE HER But first I ll take her to T-Loc s SONORA  I found their business card in my sock DRAWER I come here when I m richer  come when I m POORER She doesn t like it much  but whatevs  I still ADORE HER And I ll still keep coming back to T-Loc s SONORA  Tastes almost as good as the late SEXY CORA It made me so sad  as I had so much love FOR HER No-one can deny I m the best food TOURER And one of the best hot dogs I ve had s at T-Loc s SONORA  WHAT  Sonora later you have to try T-Loc s Sonora.  Me and the sexy goddess have totally different opinions on this place which is fine because we often do.  If they sold Grease gang members  it d be T-Bird s Sonora.  I love these messy Mexican hot dogs and this one reminds me of the ones that they sell in Los Angeles and in San Francisco on the streets after the clubs let out and whatnot or in Downtown LA during the daytime.  If they sold steaks  it d be T-Bone s Sonora.  The people running this truck are actually from Tucson Arizona  but they must know how the Mexicans make their dogs because it s actually really good. I was honestly really surprised about how good it was.  If they were the best boba chain ever  it d be T-Top s Sonora.  You may think it s a little steep  price wise. But compared to some of the other trucks here it s not even overpriced. I mean it s not cheap but it s not ridiculously over-the-top like some of the others are - and you do get a huge delicious juicy Perfection product that will probably fill you up.  Speaking of hot dogs that will fill you up.  Anyway.  If they liked to molest you while pretending to check for contraband  it d be TSA-Loc s Sonora.  The guys working here incredibly nice too  and the girls as well. They were very inquisitive as to whether we liked it and asked us to spread the word - and little do they know that I have quite a few followers on Yelp LOL. So listen to me and go and give it a try because it s worth it. In fact  it s like L Oreal in that regard  but much  much better tasting.  And if they sold male chastity devices  they d be D-Lock s Sonora.  But I m really  really glad that they don t.  One of the best hot dogs in the country  maybe the best in Texas. When it comes to the best dogs in Austin  they ve got it on D-Lock.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,72,One of the best hot dogs I ve ever had  I grab pizza rolls over by Rockin rolls then I grab a Sonoran dog as well. They have great carne asada tacos if you re not feeling hot dogs. The couple who run this spot work hard and are always so friendly. I drive from San Antonio to eat here and it s worth it every time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,73,Was on my way back to campus when I decided to pull up Yelp and see what was good in the area. Found this place with a 5 star rating and delicious photos so my mind was set. Ordered the sonora hot dog first and then just had to try the carne asada taco.  For the hot dog  man that bun is just so so soft  All the ingredients come together with so many different flavors  one of the best hot dogs i ve had  For the carne asada taco  it has to be the juiciest carne asada Ive ever had. I had to balance the taco otherwise if I tilted it in either direction  the juice would just run right out  The owners you can tell absolutely love what they do and their passion shows in their great cooking    Definitely coming back here   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,74,I rarely update my reviews.  This is the first time in over 1000 reviews that I have updated twice.  Why the update here   Because there is news.  I normally am a fan of the T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog.  The T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog is my idea of a treat.  The T-Loc Sonoran Hot Dog is how I reward myself.  If this is not the time or place for a long night of infused vodkas from Russian House  then I go to T-Loc and get myself a hot dog.  The world then becomes perfect.  Well due to certain conditions beyond my control - the astrological sign was wrong or something like that - I didn t go with my normal hot dog.  I went with the Carne Asada burrito.  I took the liberty - which is NOT house style - of reheating the burrito at home with the avocado inside of it.  I have had T-Loc s Carne Asada plates with cool avocado.  I have had the Carne Asada Burrito with warm mashed down avocado.  Trust me on this one - the warm avocado takes the dish to a brand new level.  The steak and the seasonings are already epic.   The steak has always been majorly majorly epic.   Their sauces are already outstanding.  The warmed avocado takes the dish to Godhead.  Normally - coronavirus is sad because we have to take all our truck food home.   And  by the way  people are dying too.   Coronavirus making us reheat food in the microwave is an awesome opening.  I have not been this happy with a burrito in a long long time.  T-Loc s Carne Asada Burrito is a wonderful source of happiness while all the world falls apart around us.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,75,OMG. Sonora Dog. With everything.  Wrapped in bacon  with beans  tomato  onion  mayo  mustard and I m sure I m forgetting things . Add cheese and carne asada. I could end the review there. But I won t.  So  this is the first time I have ever only eaten half a hot dog. Why you ask  Because it was so good  I want to have the other half for lunch or snack another day. I know that pretty much makes me certifiable. I don t care.  I have a theory about certain foods  finger foods of sorts such as dogs  burgers  sandwiches  etc. if it wasn t messy  it wasn t good. Or at least it wasn t made right. A good one of any of those should be more than sloppy. You should unquestionably be required to like not just your fingers after  but also the rest of your hand s . And THEN go wash them.  This hot dog not only didn t disappoint  it raised the bar. It is the gold standard. I can complain about only one thing. It needs more spice to actually be spicy. But that s not a real complaint because that thing was good. Very  very good.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,76,Hard to describe the sonoran dog. It s simply...delicious. And the staff is as exceptional as the meal. What a gem.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,77,The best hot dog and carne asada fries i ve had  might want to get it to-go or the mosquitoes will eat you
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,78,So amazing  I grew up in Tucson and was raised on Sonoran style food. This is a perfect slice of home. Very authentic and delicious  I always order at least two Sonoran dogs every time I come and their Agua Fresca tastes amazing and is refreshing.   Highly recommend ordering  con todo 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,79,This place did not disappoint -the owner and staff were very friendly and welcoming. This was my first time here -but it will not be the last. The food was outstanding well prepared and super delicious I had the Sonoran dog with all the extras it was delicious.My daughter and grandson both have the loaded Yaqui dog topped with a fried egg. Also shared a large order of their very delicious ranch fries. I recommend if you wanna great hotdog experience give this place a try .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,80,I haven t eaten a hot dog since I was 13. I m almost 23 and this was the best hot dog I ve ever had. Also the folks behind the counter are sooo nice  I haven t had such good food  amp  hospitality in a long time  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,81,The guy who makes the hot dogs is super nice and welcoming. I ordered the yaqui dog and carne asada fries. 10 10 recommend this place food is bomb. Going to try the eggsplosion next time I come.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,82,Everything here is great  you can t go wrong. Very impressed by the vegan dog. It s a flavor explosion. Everything is fresh and you can taste it. We haven t found a better Sonora style dog  The Owners staff are very friendly  Such a gem 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,83,Damn this was so good my eyes rolled back onto my head  I moaned out load that I got stares on first bite. We had the Sonoran hot dog which was the perfect combination of sweet  salty  sour and spicy. The carne asada taco and Baja burrito were perfect as well with super fresh toasted tortillas. Don t miss out on the unusual agua Fresca flavors which we had the strawberry Orange.  This place gets all the praise.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,84,Very nice owner. The hotdog was delicious. I also tried their pineapple aqua fresca. Probably one of the best I ve had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,85,Don t be fooled by the name of the truck. We had the Asada quesadilla and it was good as you can get. There s probably more Mexican food options than hot dogs. I d recommend the owners figure out to their guests about their amazing Mexican food. Be patient they were a little slow but worth the wait.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,86,Amazing food. Despite the rather small trailer  the food they put out here is amazing. We ordered two sonora dogs and carne asada fries and can t wait to go back. They even have a small and mostly socially distanced area for eating.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,87,DELICIOUS. Can t believe I waited this long to try this place. I am only halfway done with my hotdog and I m already sad in anticipation of it being gone. I got the Sonoran hot dog and a cucumber lime aguas fresca. Crispy bacon  soft but toasted bun  excellent toppings  delicious pinto beans. 10 10  I want to get another one immediately.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,88,Yesterday I had a life-changing experience.  New to the Austin area  I wanted a hot-dog  googled  and found T-Loc s Sonora.  Having once lived in the Los Angeles area  I was already familiar with bacon-wrapped dogs piled high with delicious additions  so immediately upon seeing pictures  my mouth was watering  and I was ready to find them.  As I was reading through the reviews  I noticed lots of enthusiasm around their steak burrito.  It was a tough decision to decide between the two  so I ordered one of each.   -   I had ordered online  and the food was ready well before I found their place  not hard to find  but being new here I just didn t know the area .  When I pulled in to their lot  one of their staff came to bring my order right away.  They were gracious and kind.  Great Service   Great service is good  but really  it s all about the food  right   T-Loc s Sonoran hotdogs are absolutely wonderful   Their dogs are flavorful with bacon-y wrapped goodness  the toppings are generous but balanced enough to be flavorful and not too too messy  just a little .  A true Sonoran dog isn t like getting a hotdog with stuff just slathered on top. It s got enough ingredients that it must be crafted well...no single item should overpower the flavors of the rest.  And then there s the bun...  Yes  the bun is very special.  It s something very different than your typical hotdog bun.  It s steamed instead of grilled  so it s soft  moist  ever so slightly sweet and delicious      It absorbs the ingredients enough to become an integral part of the dish.  Often I find myself discarding  extra  bits of bun...in this case  I couldn t get enough of it.  T-Loc s Sonoran Hotdogs are simply incredible   But there s more...  As good as the hotdogs were  and I will return for more   T-Loc s Carne Asada Burrito was the heart of the life changing experience.  It s deceptively simple.  It s a flour tortilla filled with steak  pico de gallo  and avocado.  Two bites into it  the second bite only to confirm what I suspected after my first bite   I realized that  although I ve traveled the world and eaten many burritos   I was eating the BEST burrito I have ever tasted   Again  perfect balance of flavors...but a Carne Asada SO bursting with flavor that just thinking about it a day later makes my mouth water again.  You may not associate words like food truck  hotdogs  and burritos with the word gourmet...until you visit T-Loc s Sonoran  then your life will be changed.  Food like this doesn t  just happen  by accident.  It s created and crafted by a deliberate act of art  love and passion.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,89,If I could design a perfect hot dog for myself  it would look nothing like the  con todo  served here... and it would taste nowhere near as good. It s not an especially big or especially cheap item  but its quality still makes it especial. And as with most food trucks  there are friendly people behind the counter to take and make your order. Conclusion  I ll be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,90,Burritos  hotdogs and carne asada fried were all on point  Fire  Definitely recommend if in the area
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,91,Food is awesome as always I wish I could eat here every day. Service amazing as always same with food eat a Sonora dog today.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,92,I can t stop ordering the Ranch Fries from T-Loc s. They are  as my husband says   stupid good.  The hot dogs are phenomenal  but now that I know about the fries  I have a difficult decision to make every time. Anyway  you really can t go wrong with anything here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,93,Okay  let me just start off by saying that their hotdogs taste just like the hotdogs back home  These are true AUTHENTIC Sonoran dogs. The ONLY ones I ll eat here in Texas. You truly will not be disappointed  Also  shoutout to all my Arizona peeps  Gotta represent
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,94,Shame on me for not reviewing this gem sooner  they deserve our utmost support and patronage for their outstanding mastery of the secret Sonoran treasure known as the hot dog.   Seriously  this is the ONLY place I ve been to outside of Tucson that does this right. Sonoran dogs are diamonds  rare  hard to find  and one of quality is worth more than gold.   The Sonoran Hot Dogs here are works of art. In a city obsessed with great food  T-Locs stands out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,95,This food is the real deal flavors of Sonora   Fresh  well flavored meats  we the tacos a la plancha  the carne asada and torta and Sonoran hotdog.   Authentic flavors  fresh bread  well seasoned meats.  I ll be back soon 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,96,The owner Miguel is so sweet and makes sure your experience is top notch. The Sonoran hot dogs are definitely something you can t get in elsewhere. The variety of hotdogs suits anyone s needs - traditional pork  Hebrew National beef  and veggie dogs. I also got carne asada fries which were loaded with 1 4 lb of meat along with great accoutrements. This food truck is always hoppin  and rightly so 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,97,First time trying this place and it was sooo good  For me the loaded fries were the best  It s a bit of a drive for me but will deff go again. Dk if he is the owner or who he was but love that he came out and talk to me asked how I was liking the food. Nice touch 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,98,I was craving dessert and decided as a nearby suggestion found this food truck park... and somehow convinced myself get hot dogs as well. The Sonora hot dog sounded quite interesting while passing by  and decided to try some. The people who run the truck are absolutely amazing  super friendly  funny  and passionate about their business. Mustard is something I usually avoid and usually ask to keep off my hot dogs  but after some convincing from Miguel I decided to keep it on. Despite being a super busy truck that day  it only took about 5 minutes to get both hot dogs.   For the food  the hotdogs are absolutely amazing. Honestly probably the best hot dog I ve had. There s so many flavors that I m surprised they all mesh together so nicely. I probably ate the entire hot dog in like 2 minutes. Highly recommend and will be my new stop for whenever I m craving a hot dog now. We also ordered the Carne Asada fries  but the meat was a little bit too salty for me to eat. But all around an amazing food truck 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,99,I love Sonora Dogs but really not had a proper one since El Guero Canelo in Tuscon. But  this place might be just as good or better  How could anyone not like a bacon wrapped hot dog with essentially taco filling inside a sweet fluffy toasted bun. Also add to the story that serve they have a Ranch Fries that are covered in bacon  cheese  homemade ranch with crinkle cut fries     This is a must have item for sure to go with your dogs you will for sure double fist.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,100,Their Sonora Hot Dog is exactly what I wanted out of a delicious  new flavor of a classic treat. The bun on this thing is so soft but holds it s structure  the beans are full of flavor  the sauces work perfectly together and the bacon adds to the overall texture and bite of the hot dog. This is a new favorite spot of mine.   This lot has about 8 food trucks all with a nice variety of things from ice cream tacos to Thai food and JewBoys Burgers. It s great  Got to check this out if you want a break from your normal routine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,101,Heard about T-Loc s through word of mouth and this is by far the best. Not only is the food amazing  the owners areal so awesome and friendly  the vibe is like friends all hanging out in the backyard eating amazing food. The hot dogs wrapped in bacon  with added ingredients I wouldn t think to add on makes my mouth water just writing this. The tacos are also fantastic but you must and absolutely must order the carne Asada fries  can t even explain how amazing those are   hurry  Asada sells out fast  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,102,Good food and the owner is a cool dude that takes pride in his product.  Can t really ask for more than that. And those hot peppers  ahhhh 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,103,They make you feel like family   VIP treatment and the food is always consistently delicious 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,104,From day one my family and I have loved this place   The owners are very friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious.  Best hotdogs in Austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,105,Absolutely the best burrito in Austin.  Locally owned and operated and community focused. Definitely give them a try
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,106,Hot dog this place is so yummy   I recommend it all.  It s a little truck in the food truck park off burnet.  Dessert is also really tasty.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,107,I didn t know a hot dog could be that good  I can t wait to go back to try more from the menu. Absolutely amazing 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,108,Every now and then I crave a good weenie. Who doesn t  If you want something really unique  to ATX anyway   visit T-Loc s and go all in by ordering a legit Sonoran  as in Mexico  hot dog with all its toppings  aka  con todo    dog wrapped in bacon topped with pinto beans  caramelized  onions  raw onions  tomato  and squirts of mayo  mustard  and Caribbean pepper sauce. It looks intimidating and sounds a bit confusing  but wow  what a mouthful of yum  Yes  the Sonoran style dog is as messy to eat as it looks. That s okay - the uber friendly owner  Miguel  won t hesitate to provide you with a big handful of napkins  is it sinful to ask for a fork  ...and tell you about his journey and explain exactly what the heck a Sonoran is. In short  it s tasty  it s different  it s filling  and it ll only set you back 5 bucks  add  1 if you prefer a Hebrew National .    If you re not feeling particularly adventurous  T-Loc s does offer some standard dogs  as well as burritos  quesadillas  some breakfast items and more...BUT please at least try a Sonoran once. Admittedly  my minimalist French s mustard only on hot dog hubby wasn t a huge fan. In any event  he can at least say he s had and knows what a Sonoran is. Culture - food - good.  D  Note  to keep their food as legit as possible  the buns and tortillas are shipped in from AZ. Now that s commitment to quality.   Tip  T-Loc s food trailer is located in the 5000 Burnet  food court   parking is a breeze  and you can BYOB. Cheers 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,109,Great service food is amazing     I had carne assada fries and hot dog   totally recommend
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,110,There s a reason why this place is 5 stars on Yelp. The people who run the truck are SO friendly  they informed us about everything and were kind and patient.   Me and my friend ordered the Con Todo hot dog and the Carne Asada burrito. The guy who runs it wiped down the tables for us because it was raining. Talk about caring for his customers  He brought out the food to us and it looked delicious. He even told us the origin of the name and where they came from. In Arizona  there s plenty of hot dog stands but none in Austin. How cool that he shared that with us.   Unfortunately I had to be on the phone for an insurance call  so I m not sure if the hot dog got a little soggy in the bread. Nonetheless  it was yummy.   But the burrito was amazing. I dream about it sometimes. Like  damn  The sauce is fantastic and the limes compliment it so well.   If you have to order something  get the carne asada burrito. You won t regret it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,111,I ve never had a better hot dog  The bun is so good  not sure what type of bread it is  but it s great. Just try this place  it ll become one of your favorites.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,112,If you want Sonoran style food come here  Absolutely the best Sonoran hot dog in Texas  Great food  Great service 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,113,Stumbled upon this place when we visited Austin. We ordered Sonoran hotdogs  carne asada fries  beef burrito  and agua Fresca. Everything was good. 4 stars because price was a bit high for hotdogs with added toppings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,114,Oh  gosh I loved their food. Their hotdog is so good  especially the bread. I also tried their fries  which was super good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,115,This dog is awesome. The toppings mix for an unbelievably tasty bite. The bun is slightly sweet and just perfectly dense.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,116,This is the carne asada burrito I have been in search of. No frills  just carne  pico de gallo  and guacamole. None of the other junk that everyone else seems to think they need to put inside burritos here in Austin.  If you are familiar with the  berto  chain of hole in the wall Mexican food places all over southern California and Arizona  this will remind you exactly of those burritos.  The carne here is better quality than what I remember the socal chain to be.  I will have to give the hot dogs a try next time but it will be tough to pass up the burrito so I might have to save my macros and go for both.   Now let s get the carne asada nachos going and my diet could be in for some serious problems.   Anyhow  if you are from Cali or the southwest I would definitely recommend you give this truck a try.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,117,Miguel still whips up the most amazing dogs in town  but now there are new options as well  including a quesadillas and a taco menu.  My favorite is the Tacos a La Plancha  grilled  with beans and sizzling cheese on corn tortillas .  Every time people see my order they want to know what it is because it looks as amazing as it tastes.  His location is now in a new trailer food court  partially hidden by a building in the front.  But it s easy access off Burnet Road and there s plenty of parking in the lot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,118,When my wife got pregnant  we looked for a local hotdog joint and was able to find this place on the road while cruising on Burnet.   This place is amazing  every food item is freshly cooked to order and the flavors are incredible. Each time we go we try to get something new.  The owners are incredibly friendly and helpful with any questions on orders.   This is now a regular place we go to when we crave hotdogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,119,Suuuuper delicious everything and speedy  Everything I ve tried I ve loved- I m particularly a huge fan of their strawberry agua fresca  they change them well tho . Will come again and again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,120, 3.5 star    FOOD   I had his Hebrew Hot dog and Carne Asada Burrito. I personally enjoyed the food really much  but was not certain for its price. The quality was mediocre personally  but do know I had these take out. For hot dog  the bun was perfectly toasted and blending of all toppings and its hot dog was incredible. The steak on the burrito was well cooked and could be more juicy than how it was.   ATMOSPHERE   This is one of 12 5000 Burnet Food Truck area.   SERVICE   To be honest  he wasn t going crazy at explaining and stuff as other owners that I visited around the food truck area. I got all my stuff and it was a typical service.  SURROUNDINGS   This is one of 12 5000 Burnet Food Truck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,121,Carnitas French fries are off the hoooook  My boo and I stopped here for lunch and this was the only option that seemed reasonably priced and looked appetizing at the time. We split the fries and a Sonoran hot dog.   Beans on a hot dog  Not my thing but I can see why people would love it. The ladies running the truck were friendly and quick  talk about hustle  Make it a point to stop at this food truck while at 5000 Burnet.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,122,I don t think I ve ever craved a hot dog before  but Jeff M. insisted on starting our Austin eating escapade at T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs  TLSHD . I kind of wish that we didn t start with it  since it s such a tough act to follow.   TLSHD s Sonoran Hot Dog was stupidly good. I saw pictures of the hot dog and thought   ehhh  it looks like a hot dog with relish and mayo. It can t be that good.  I couldn t be more wrong. The  relish  is a jalape o sauce that wasn t very spicy at all  but it added a great amount of flavor. My favorite part of the hot dog was the bun  The dog was served on a bolillo  a type of French bread  that they special order from Arizona every week. It had the slightest bit of crisp but was unbelievably soft on the inside. We tried to get the name of the bakery  but their lips were sealed. The dog also comes with a grilled pepper that s slightly salted and grilled. Delicious   The staff was pretty nice too. They came out and explained what was used in the dog  what made the dog a Sonoran Hot Dog  and they told us the proper way to eat the hot dog  take a bite of the dog  then bite the pepper .  I can t say enough good things about TLSHD  Everything was delicious and it made me want to get another one right away. Get yourself to TLSHD and get yourself one of these glorious dogs 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,123,These Sonora hot dogs are one of a kind  and once you try them you won t stop craving them   I definitely recommend putting this on your Austin foodie list 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,124,I  can see how a lot of people would miss out on the perfect hot dog by being picky or reluctant to try all of the ingredients. Do yourself a favor and get over it. Try the Sonoran hot dog  con todo.  It s perfect. If we lived in Austin  we would be here on the reg. The other items on the menu looked amazing  especially the steak fries. We tried to go back the next day  but they are closed on Sundays.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,125,This place is always a hit never a miss. From staff friendly and caring attitude to the bomb a   food. My wife and always keep coming back. The Sonora con todo is
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,126,Super friendly service and delicious dogs loaded with toppings. Were very accommodating with masks and mentioned how the buns are shipped in daily from Arizona. Got loaded carne asada fries that were big enough to share and then some. Flavorful and fresh with some great crispness to the fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,127,Fantastic hotdogs and buns  I m not sure how they get them to taste so fresh and light but they re delicious  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,128,THE BEST ESTABLISHMENT IN AUSTIN    The absolute nicest and kindest owners. Your meal is always served with laughs and good stories. I have been coming here for six years and have never had anything but amazing food and good times. Every single thing on their menu is phenomenal. When I get married I ll ask them to cater the wedding and probably perform the service. Seriously  I can t even convey how much I love T-Loc s. You are missing out if you don t eat here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,129,There is definitely something special going on here   I will be honest I have never ever been too excited about hot dogs in my life.  The ones I prefer are generally covered in chili and cheese  but that is not what is going on here at all   This is what I would call hot dog art   What is coming out of this food trailer on burnet is genius     I have mentioned in other reviews before how sometimes simple is perfection - this is the same for Sonora.  The menu is pretty simple - not many items at all - perfection rolling out to turn your world upside down     So here is how it works with the hot dog  - you choose your wiener - regular  premium or veggie  i got premium bc it s national Hebrew and those are the bomb  - and that s it ... you wait   What comes out is a bacon wrapped hot dog sitting in the beautiful fluffy cloud of a bun and all kinds of crazy goodness on top  It s amazing - I promise  Trust me.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,130,The Carne Asada fries are dank  The food was fresh and delicious. For sure going back. Thanks T-Loc 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,131,I was so happy to stop in here tonight. I had recently found out about it and ever since my introduction to the Sonora Dog in my birthplace of Tucson  I was making it a point to stop in sooner than later.   From the moment I walked up to the food truck window I knew I was in the presence of a fellow T-Loc  Tucson Local  with the owner operator  Miguel. Us Tucsonians somehow have a way of finding each other outside our hometown. Miguel was so nice and we talked the entire time he was busily making mad  crazy orders of sonora dog after sonora dog.  I got mine w o onions and yellow mustard and it was just as amazing and delicious as I remember it  I also got the  6 Hebrew National version because I get kosher whenever it s available and because you can really taste that  1 difference   I was also tickled that they had the orange Jarritos  basically the upscale version of a Fanta  and after popping the top I was immediately having flashbacks to my childhood in Tucson and Nogales  AZ.    So thank you  T-Locs for the delectable  nostalgic edible memories  Horale 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,132,BEST HOT DOGS in Austin   The burrito and carne asada fries are the best. Sulma and Mike are so friendly  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,133,The hot dog is so good    Fantastic quality and amazing flavor  I deeply recommend  I got the hot dog with everything  and they make a small one for children.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,134,Literally the nicest and coolest people  They have INCREDIBLE veggie hotdogs. I wake up in the middle of the night and my first thought is their ranch fries. They have special menus for special occasions like  national hotdog day   They always treat me like family. I downloaded the yelp app just so you can all know it s incredible  so go there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,135,Definitely a reason this place has 5 starts and almost 400 reviews.   How good can a hot dog get  This place has set the standard. I was a little hesitant seeing a bacon wrapped hot dog thinking the bacon would be messy. But the bacon is wrapped perfectly around the hot dog where it doesn t get in the way. If the toppings on the hot dog worry you  don t be. The flavors work wonderfully together. And the bun... just perfect.   Agua fresca is a great addition to drink along with it. Don t skip it.  Parking can be a little bit of a hassle on the actual lot  but there are neighboring park lots.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,136,I wore a mask while ordering but when I sat down i had something new on my face... The most amazing burrito I ve ever had. This place is the forking best location for food. Full stop. Period. End of story. Put the cattle in the barn. House slippers comfy comfort food. The flavors  the service  the food are all the best. Don t waste your time anywhere else  The carne asada fries were my favorite. Like walk a mile on hot coals good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,137,Love this place. Amazing service. One of the best burritos in Austin. The hot dog con todo also lives up to the hype.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,138,If you ve ever been to Tucson or the Sonoran region  you know that Sonoran hot dogs are something you can t find anywhere else. Even the bread that is used for these is a specialty  so these guys are making literal magic happen to deliver an authentic Sonoran hot dog all the way in Texas.  If you re asking yourself  how could a hot dog be that good   - check them out for yourself. Once you have one  you ll understand that yes  Sonoran hot dogs really are legendary.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,139,Love the dogs at Yo-Yos in Houston.  Read the reviews and had to try these out.  To say they are special is an understatement.  They have sweet  spicy  sour  and savory all in the same bite.    There is a reason they are too 10 in the US year after year.  Some of the nicest people you will ever meet.   Pony up and enjoy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,140,Always friendly. Always yummy. Always fresh. It s like going to a friends house for a special lunch or dinner in their patio. The carne asada burrito is the best. Especially once they taught me how to use the green sauce and lime 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,141,Great hot dogs. Hands down. Amazing taste. Not Spicey at all Even though it comes with peppers. Recommend peppers. and the papas bravas were the best fries with shrimp anywhere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,142,Best hot dog in Austin tx by far    And don t even mention their Asada Burritos just amazing   5000 Burnet rd go and try it   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,143,This place is a must try  Everything I ve had is amazing. Yaqui dog and ranch fries hit the spot  Definitely recommend you try to go at lunch. Dinner time on a Friday was a bit busy but worth the wait 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,144,Amazing food and people. The hot dogs and burritos de carne asada are the best  Can t go wrong with the fries either.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,145,Anticipation had been building for months. I could not wait another day to finally taste Tone Loc s Funky Hot Sonora dog. I had my parody rap review half written. Then Joe C. had to go all Urban Dictionary on me and ruin the dream by informing me that  T-Loc  in fact stands for  Tuscon Local.  Turns out the adorable proprietors have made it to Austin by way of Arizona.   Okay  fine  but oooh  that bacon-wrapped dog  Such a fresh  pillowy bun. Such tasty toppings  Such a flavorful meat  Such a pleasing texture  crispy where you need it  tender where you don t. And then there s that freshly grilled pepper... Oh my  do not miss the perfection of a bite of the pepper with a mouthful of the dog. Spicy heaven   I m watching my figure  or I certainly would have devoured 2 or 3 of these bad boys. You bet I ll be back. This week. Or tomorrow.

T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,146,Whenever we come to Austin we always search for amazing places with great ratings in advance. With a couple of weeks worth planing this was the first stop for food and boy was it amazing    We got the Carne Asada Fries and the famous con todo hotdog ALLL the way    My girlfriend and I split sense we plan on shoving more food down our goblets. Everything we ate was fresh and authentic.  So the Con Todo comes with  mustard  frijoles  tomatoe  onion  mayo  jalape os and a hotdog wrapped with bacon on a fresh steamed bun.  P.S. It Broke my heart to see people ordering from here and just wanted no jalape os  no mayo  no onions  no mustard and asked for...KETCHUP...people live and try new things. You don t see of find a lot of food trucks that are passionate about what they do.  JUST TRY IT  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,147,I m from Tucson but live in Dallas. This lunch was AMAZING and brought me right back to home. The owners are outstanding people who work very hard to make your experience great 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,148,This hot dog is pretty damn tasty. The bun is perfect too  toasty and fluffy. I m not a big hot dog person but wanted to try it and got it made the way they do it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We got fries as well and a nice mexican coke. The guy is really nice. Try it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,149,I started coming here around Winter 2014. Miguel  the owner  asked me how I found out about the place since they recently moved to Austin to start T-Loc s. I was craving for a good hot dog joint and that led me to their fabulous food truck on Burnet. Miguel s very personable and every time you meet him it seems like old friends reuniting again. This Sonora Hot Dog is my favorite hot dog of all time. Nothing I ve had in the past has compared to this hot dog. Everything on this hot dog fits perfectly together - the combination of flavors from the bacon wrapped dog to the diced tomatoes are amazing. The best part  the bun. My goodness  I wish HEB sold these buns. But apparently Miguel gets the buns shipped from a different region. The burrito is excellent too  I have introduced friends to this food truck and they have raved about it. When you talk about the food culture of Austin  food trucks plays a big role and T-Loc s is one of the best.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,150,To put it briefly  I AM HOOKED     This is the best hot dog I ve ever had. Get it all the way and ask for a Hungarian wax pepper on the side. Also have the carne asada fries they are over the top as well. To top it all off the owners are fantastically fun. Can t wait to come back    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,151,I sometimes feel funny saying this  but I now have a  favorite hot dog place.  I ve never been one to crave hot dogs growing up  but that s likely because I never grew up having a hot dog like the ones Miguel and Zulma serve up at Sonora. Others have described the famous Con Todo hot dog so I won t go into much here  but think of their signature hot dog like a gourmet hot dog with all the works and then some. Miguel is an accomplished chef and he brings that culinary experience and spirit to all of his menu items. Every ingredient on the hot dog is purposeful and is served in just the right quantity. And the bun is to die for. It gets shipped in daily from New Mexico so this is the real deal. Once you ve had the Sonora bun  you ll be wondering why all hot dogs don t get served in a Sonora bun. Trust me    I ve been a customer of theirs for nearly three years now  followed them across three different locations  and I can say the only thing that has changed is the menu now has more offerings  including fries  tacos  simple hot dogs for kids  and quesadillas. Remaining delightfully consistent over the years are the friendly owners behind Sonora  Miguel and Zulma  and the exceptionally consistent quality of their food. My wife and I always enjoy catching up with them  and since the very beginning  they have always treated us like family.  When the weather is nice outside  ask them about their homemade agua fresca. When they do have it  it sells out pretty much every day so get there early and ask for their agua fresca of the day   p.s. We also recommend their asada burrito  And did we mention the hot dog comes with this delicious grilled pepper  Man  sometimes I just crave that perfectly grilled and lightly salted pepper 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,152,A Sonoran hot dog    What is it  I must eat it  Those were the thoughts going through my head as a saw the food truck.   So a Sonoran dog is a hot dog  wrapped in bacon  with beans on it  tomatoes  onion  mustard  ketchup   jalape o sauce - hold the mayo - on a slightly sweet bun imported from Tucson   The dogs are grilled as you order them  amp  the bun is grilled to a nice crisp. It is one amazing dog   This is a must try food truck. You re going to be in hot dog heaven 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,153,I had a pleasant experience ordering here. It was my first time and the owner was super nice. I ordered the Sonora hot dog and it was delicious  I would definitely recommend trying this place if you are on the fence about it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,154,What can be said about this place that has not. Owners are friendly   get to know their customers  the hot dogs are fantastic blend of flavors and buns are spot on. I have eaten here at least a dozen times and the quality never fluctuates  even being someone who does not care for mustard it just works.   Would suggest trying the premium dogs and carne asada tacos    you can do one and one and get a nice plate that will make you want to walk home.   To the review on here complaining about the  hot dog  quality   exactly where have you eaten a Sonora dog off a cart that you questioned the hot dog used...pretty sure I don t want to know most of the times. The trade off here is good quality   good taste   good people and supporting someone that cares about who they are serving.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,155,The first time I heard of a Sonoran style hot dog was some time a few years ago on Man vs. Food. At the time I was skeptical of the combination. Mayo  Beans  Tomatoes  Jalepeno sauce  On a bacon wrapped hot dog  In a bolillo roll  There s absolutely nothing in this dish that resonates with any experience I ve ever had with a hot dog in my life. And now that I ve tried this combination  I can t help but wonder what had I been missing out on for so long.  The bolillo roll is really one of a kind - nothing like you find in any supermarkets here  almost a cross between a bolillo roll and a new england style hot dog bun but it just works. And when I saw that the regular hot dogs here were the Bar-S type  I was like eh but its salty punch helps balance out the rest of the flavors. I can t quite put my hand on it  but everything just works together so well in a soft but crisp roll. Despite that long list on condiments above  the condiments play a complementary role and don t overwhelm it. I can see why this place gets rave reviews.  That said  not sure I d pay  5 for the hot dog  I d think the Hebrew national would come default at that price but w e   since for most people I d feel they d need at least 2 to get full. Owner is super nice talkative guy too  Will come back to try out that carne asada and the burrito...and maybe another hot dog if I got change to spare.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,156,I ve eaten a lot of hot dogs. I m a self proclaimed hot dog connoisseur  with home grown NYC experience to back me up. Onto my review   I purchased the premium Sonara Hot Dog. This comes with a Hebrew National Frank instead of Bar S for  6. I was a little disappointed that it wasn t a longer size than your standard dog for the price  however the ingredients does make up  for it. The Sonara Hot Dog comes with bacon wrapped with onions  mayo mustard  chopped tomatoes  grilled onions  I got mine without these   jalapeno sauce  and beans. The ingredients meshed together really well taste-wise. You would need two to be truly satisfied given it s a regular sized hot dog. The bread was your plain ole Jane it was very tasty. I think the buns are a special order.   I won t be in a rush to come back here however  because I like the variety of Man  Bites Dog or Frank and I think you gret more bang for your buck in this price range however  you can t go wrong experiencing Sonara Hot Dog. The owner was very personable and he seem to have a good rapport with his clients. Sonara Hot Dogs does offer a couple of other items like a quesadilla and a burrito  but I kept it classic with what I believe it s known for.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,157,There was a time in the summer where I was obsessed with hot dogs. I ate a hot dog every day. I decided to try out this hot dog truck that everyone has been craving about. When I looked into it I was like wait  it has beans in it   Sounds interesting  I have to try it. My friend is quite the picky eater and was scared about all of the toppings on the hot dog  but she had to try the original one. The man that ran the truck was very accommodating and friendly. He suggested putting a tiny half line of mustard on her dog because she hates mustard. Turns out  the hype was real. Everything went together surprisingly well. The grilled pepper that came with it gave it a kick. It was pretty spicy though  not going to lie. I wish I could eat 5 of these  but I am at a point in my life where a  2 pack of hot dogs is all I can afford right now.  collegeprobs but hot dogs 4 lyfe
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,158,I ve been coming here for about 5 years and it s never disappointed me. Hard to imagine holding the same standard for such a long time  Hands down the best hot dog I ve ever had. I ll always seek you out and will drive hours to come see you  Keep it up buddy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,159,One of the many reasons I love Austin. This foodtruck is known for their amazing hot dogs  best in Texas for sure   but they also have the most yummiest  most perfect burritos.  The steak  the beans  the cheese  the tortilla...everything is perfect and magical. My boyfriend and I come here on average at least once a week.   A great ambiance too...a few other food trucks on the lot. Pretty clean area  a place for kids to play while you sit and enjoy either the best hot dog or best burrito in Austin . This used to be the only food truck on the lot...and now there are many after realizing it s perfect location.  Can t wait to have it again later this week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,160,Amazing Sonoran Dogs and Carne Asada from Tucson  Arizona. Very hard to find this type of food in Austin. Heads up the tortillas and hot dogs are much different than you normally see in town  which is awesome.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,161,They have the Best Vegan Dog EVER  Sweet bun  mayo  tomatoes  beans  hot sauce.  Wow.  My friends and I dream about these dogs often.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,162,I hadn t had a Sonoran hot dog in 4 years din r my last trip to Tucson. Upon arriving Miguel welcomed me and let me know these are authentic. The buns are flown in from Tucson and T-Locs actually stands for Tucson Locals. I fell in love with this dog again after first bite. I can t wait to visit again in October.

T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,163,Awesome. New way to eat a dog. The toppings and the bread are the stars of this show. The roasted   salted pepper on the side takes it over the top.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,164,I saw a review for T-Loc s in a Yelp email for National Hot Dog Month. I worked for a while in the Tucson area and was familiar with the Mexican style hot dogs T-Loc s is famous for. I just happened to be in the neighborhood so I stopped by to check  em out. Without any reservations  i have to say that Miguel and his partner have not only nailed it  but exceeded the flavor I held in my memory. They were so friendly and informative  talking about their struggles and successes and the love of what they re doing. I am absolutely rooting for team T-Loc    I went for the best  Their Sonora Dog Con Todo with a Lemonade Ginger Agua Fresca. Everything was exceptional. The bun is like no other and  while slightly crispy on the outside  literally melts in your mouth. I have no idea what kind of bread it is or the dough used  but it is almost like a sopapilla on the inside. They ship in the rolls because he can t find anyone to make it locally to his specifications. The layering of flavorful ingredients and sauces over a perfectly grilled bacon-wrapped hot dog still has my mouth watering. I advise getting it just the way they offer it - with everything - that s what sets it above the rest. I ll be back on a regular basis and  who knows  I might even try the rest of the menu offerings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,165,Perfection  The most unique hot dog I have ever had. The bread is brought in weekly and yummy. A perfect balance of flavors.  I m not much a a burrito fan normally but loved it  Very cute clean outdoor setting and prime location.  You can tell the pride and love that the owners chefs put into making the dining experience excellent. Can t wait to go back and sample more of the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,166,If you like hot dogs  there is no better place than This place  so unique and so delicious  You need to come.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,167,Hot dogs were great and very filling  My husband got the burrito with egg and loved it  was also a good size   Our girls got the asada fries and for picky eaters they also loved them.Great atmosphere as well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,168,First time here and this place was the bomb diggity       Had a hard time picking what to get only because everything seemed so good and couldn t decide. Decided to go with the carne asada fries and Sonoran Style Hot Dog. They had ran out the Mexican cream for fries but still decided to get without it and they were delicious. The Mexican cream is will be like an entry to heaven. Will definitely be coming back many more times  but with the intent of getting to hot dogs instead of one. Good find  great food
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,169,Let me just start off by saying I am a Tucson  T-Loc  native. This is the real thing. It does exist  fellow T Locs. Miguel  aka Mike  the owner  flies in the bolillo buns FROM TUCSON via fed ex. This is a big deal for anyone who doesn t understand how important the bolillo bun is to the Sonoran hot dog. If you haven t had a Sonoran hot dog yet let me make your mouth water...  You start off with a warm  toasty bolillo bun  has a hint of sweetness to it vs regular buns and is closed on the ends to hold all the goodies . Then you grill a hot dog with bacon ON A FLAT TOP GRILL. Yes people...on. A. Flat. Top. Grill. This is key and Miguel does this. You just have to go there to have him describe in sensual foodie detail the amazingness that is the glorious Sonoran hot dog.   BUT WAIT THERE S MORE     He makes the most legit carne Asada burritos and quesadillas too and they re freakin AWESOME. If I wasn t on a strict meal plan and only given one cheat meal a week I would be here every day. EVERY. DAY.   I haven t even mentioned the fact that the customer service here is way above and beyond. He and his lady Zulma  I think that s her name  are really friendly  and  amable . They recently took a quick drive to Tucson to buy supplies and he even asked if there was anything he could pick up for me. Whaaaaaat  I declined but today he gave me a small pack of some delicious tortillas. Amazing.   This place is also BYOB as of 2 2016 soooo bring some Modelo and lime and get ready to experience that which is Sonoran style food euphoria.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,170,T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs are amazing  It will change your life  Before trying their hot dogs  I didn t like anything if it wasn t a plane hot dog with ketchup and mayo  the end.. no more and no less . My hot dog tastes were extremely black and white. I surprised myself since it is unlike me but I love their sonoran hot dogs. Be open minded if you are a picky hot dog eater like me since it has a lot of ingredients  but all the different ingredients play together so well. To me it s not a hot dog  it is a flavor experience  And don t ignore the lightly grilled and salted pepper that comes with it  it greatly adds to the experience  I ve tried their other menu items as well and they are all delicious but the hot dog will always be my favorite because I can t get anything like it elsewhere.  Also  the owners are very friendly and always a treat to see  I am impressed that Miguel recognizes me every time I come by even after just 1 visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,171,Hotdogs and burritos  My... least expected combination of amazing food. It doesn t matter. It s 2015 and Miley Cyrus told me us we could do whatever we want.  The dude behind all this creation gave me to opportunity to eat the premium hotdog and the carne asada burrito. In exchange for some money.   Hot dogs  the regular is  5 and is not all beef. The premium is  6 and is all beef. Both hotdogs come with bacon. Yes  it sounds like a car wash but I assure you that it tastes much better. There are so many flavors in this hot dog that I wanted to get a second one before I was even done eating.   Burrito  the owner knows the real deal. No rice to fill you up with such nonsense. This burrito is just as flavorful and is out of the world.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,172,Being from Arizona and there being no carne asada out here  it was a little upsetting  until we found this food truck. Even though he is a U of lAme fan  his food was just perfect. The tortilla was fresh  my picky son LOVED his quesadilla  and the carne asada taco was perfectly cooked and seasoned   We will definitely be coming back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,173,I haven t tried anything else besides the con todo aka with everything hot dogs but they are  definitely the bomb    I have lived in El Paso Texas half my life and frequently when to Juarez to have a hot dog made this way and when I moved  to Austin I really didn t find a place that made them like home but this place is pretty close and now that I know it s here I ll be back for more. Definitely stop by and try this place great lil spot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,174,If your are from Southern California and have been on the hunt for San Diego mexican food then you found the right place for Carne asada burritos and fries  Super nice people and great carne asada.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,175,Short weekend trip from Houston and my cousin said I had to try out these hot dogs.  They have the best hot dogs ever.  Not too salty and the buns are amazing.  The toppings all come together well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,176,I Person I know took me overt there and I really like the hotdog even when I m not a fast food person .. I will recommend this place to all of you but the best part are the owner .. super friendly people and you can talk long enough with them .. and they are well know  travel
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,177,If I could give this review more than 5 Stars I would. The people that run this Food Truck are extremely friendly and accommodating and genuinely enjoy what they are doing and have a passion for the food that they provide.   I have never had a Hot Dog come close to what I had here and my one regret of moving to Houston was not being able to eat here as often as I d like. 110  Satisfaction with the Service and Food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,178,Mystified by all these 5 star reviews  which just goes to show that people in Austin will pay almost anything for a food item they are not familiar with. It s a hot dog with just more toppings than normal. Place uses the cheapest wieners  Bar-X  then charge you  6 bucks for the thing. Want to  upgrade  Hebrew National-style   7 is the entrance fee... still a single hotdog. Taste is OK but nothing compared to being in Tucson where one can pound these all the live long day for  2.75   pop   Flying in the buns daily from Tucson  Gimmick which sounds uber retarded  as Arizona water is even worse for breadstuffs than here in Texas. Maybe these dudes are  6 because the FedEx fees are wrapped into the amount   Inside crammed food truck court with crappy parking. Good luck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,179,I m not even sure how to write this review because all of the words i can think of to describe how good a Sonora Dog is  just seem to be completely and utterly inadequate. This hot dog stand is so  so  so  so AMAZING   I am totally in love with Sonora Hot Dogs   Highlights   -This is a food truck with a hot dog mission.  There aren t your average hot dogs  there are Sonora Dogs which means it it a bacon wrapped  grilled hot dog  on top of pinto beans  on a speciality made hot dog bun shipped in from Tucson  smothered in pico de gallo  onions  mayo  mustard  jalape o sauce  and served with a grilled chile on the side.  And in a word  it is DELICIOUS   -For non-hot dog people  there are also fantastic carne asada burritos and quesadillas.  I can t speak for the burrito  but the carne asada quesadilla was super tasty in its cheesy goodness  You can also order just a plain quesadilla as well.  -So  you re a vegetarian  You are in luck  They also have vegan hot dogs with veganaise.    -Mexican sodas and aqua frescos are also available to complete your meal here.  yummy   If you haven t tried Sonora Hot Dogs yet  get over here ASAP and stuff your lovely face   On a side note  they do offer Hebrew National hot dogs as the upgraded hot dog option.  This is a superior hot dog for all intents and purposes and I love them. However  as the upgraded option  it includes the hot dog to be wrapped in bacon.  This is amazing for me on all levels  but can be disappointing to others.   Why you ask   Well  we had some kosher people in our group.  I had told them that they also served Hebrew National hot dogs  so they could get some dogs too.  I hadn t been before  so i didn t know about the bacon.  I guess all of the kosher Hebrew National hot dogs are wrapped in bacon as part of the prep process.  So we had a couple people who couldn t try the dogs for kosher reasons.  I would suggest maybe keep a couple kosher dogs kosher.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,180,Excellent hot dogs  super friendly service. These things are expertly crafted and you can tell they take pride in their work. Haven t seen another Sonoran dog anywhere else in town  so I was excited about this place. Should have more umbrellas as eating in the sun isn t great and I m too much of a mess to eat these in the car.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,181,Tucson flair   Fly in their hot dog buns from Tucson  and their hotdogs are fabulous.  Their Ranch Fries are to die for   Thanks for making Austin your home and sharing all your greatness with us 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,182,I wish hot dogs were good for you  because I would like to eat most if not all of my meals at this place. Just WOW 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,183,I m from Tucson AZ. I love living in Austin but get homesick for the Mexican food I know and love and let me tell you  the first time I ate at T-Locs I had happy tears in my eyes. Sonoran hot dogs  caramelos  carne asada fries  and burritos are all so delicious and authentic to the area. Can t say enough about it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,184,This place was amaze balls. My husband has been craving a hot dog and the Sonora hot dogs hit the spot   We also had the carne asada fries that were beyond our expectations  Definitely coming back and trying other items on the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,185,The burrito is even better    How is this possible    My friend ate a Con Todo  bacon wrapped hot dog w  fixings and beans  while we were there and was so enamored she ordered another to-go. Shhh    You know who you are...  If you haven t tried this food truck across from Allendale HEB  go ASAP. You won t be disappointed.  And don t forget- those aguas frescas are not only refreshing  but they also make a perfect base for your favorite pool beverage 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,186,We ordered a little bit of everything the service was amazing and so was the food u guys are doing an amazing job    Sincerely    The Craft burger food truck couple 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,187,The best example of what a food truck should be  friendly and fast service  short menu with a focus on perfecting a few items  and the occasional long line proving how good the food is.   Do you know what makes a  Sonoran-style hot dog Sonoran  I didn t until I visited for my first time. Like everyone else has said  the bacon-wrapped dog with fresh  southwestern  toppings is stand-out  but it s not the reason I ll be returning again and again.   I ll be returning again and again for   the carne asada burrito and the quesadilla. Both are at the top of their class in terms of quality of ingredients and attention to construction. Yes  that s right  a burrito has to be constructed in just the right way as to ensure a series of  perfect bites  and to guarantee  as much as you can  preventing the dreaded  explosion --non-bite end of burrito opening up  causing the filing to escape. This burrito is one where you ll want to chew slowly as to savor  as much as you possibly can  the tenderness of the beef  the freshness of the avocado  and the genuine perfection resulting from an ideal combination of ingredients.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,188,No one is happier than me finding this place  I used to eat Sonoran dogs in Phoenix and hadn t had one in about 5 years until yesterday  I was looking on yelp for lunch and this popped up. I headed over and found the owner and his wife in the food truck. They were awesome to chat with  I excitedly told them about my previous experience with these types of hotdogs and turns out they came out here from Arizona just to do this type of food  Man  am I happy  I work close by and told them I d be seeing them often  The food was delicious and an even better rendition of the Sonoran dogs I had in Phoenix. Order it just the way they suggest it. You won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,189,Miguel was amazing     Everything was delicious     The flavors melt in your mouth  I am so happy that we found this place  Am I coming back  Yes I will           
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,190,I went here the other day and my god you can get a large fajita like thing for only a few dollars from here burning hot from the oven whenever you get there. Also their hot dogs are to die for and must be tried at least once from any casual austinite. They re so good and the ppl at the counter are extremely nice. Today I went there and the lady said I didn t need to tip them. Like for real  Nobody ever denies a tip. But I can at least tip them with this well deserved review. Give them a try if you re in the area.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,191,I finally got to try the famous hot dog after months of trying to make it there when they re open and I have to say I was not disappointed  it was definitely an interesting mix but would for sure go back again for another. Left me completely satisfied and full
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,192,This guys does it RIGHT    Yes the hot dog  Sonora  was really good. Cooked just rights  super soft bun with good ingredients and time taken to prepare. But what REALLY had me going was the  carne asada burrito  This thing ROCKS  just beef  Avocado and cheese. No rice  no beans or filler of any kind.   He even came out to talk to us about how he prepares and it was obvious he takes pride in what he s doing. I will be back for my burrito fix for sure and the sauces were home made as well. The red one does have some bite but not as much as I expected based on reviews.  Pros  Cool location  umbrellas  nice breeze. Good food and great people running it.  Cons  I shouldn t be eating a hot dog AND a burrito in one sitting but after trying my partners burrito  I HAD to  Dammit that means extra time on the treadmill this week. Worth it.   Tucson Locals - you got my vote  T-Loc s .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,193,Gosh damn. The best hot dog I ve ever had in my life. The fluffy bun. The perfectly cooked premium hot dog. All the perfectly portioned and distributed toppings. GOSH DAMN. Absolutely worth the  6.50. The roasted pepper is delicious too  Goes great with the hot dog.  Service was great too  it s pretty cold outside  so you can wait in the car and he ll bring your order to you  He s also a pretty nice dude   I d definitely come back for more  5 5.  Update  Just tried the Carne Asada burrito  very good  but the hot dog is definitely where it s at. Only complaint would be that it s smaller than what you d think for the price.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,194,One of the best hot dogs I have ever had  made to order and always hot and fresh  Fresh ingredients and great customer service. Not to mention they are located and a very cool relaxed location.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,195,I used to think mission dogs was pretty good but then found out about this awesome trailer   The couple that run this stand are out of this world personable and the food does not disappoint  The hot dog buns are shipped from an AZ bakery   The crema and beans with a charred pepper are unique and delicious.  Their cheese taco is also killer with some pickled onion.  I ve tried their Tortas too and only Dos Batos can compare.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,196,Great food and great people.  the sonoran hotdog and carne asada plate is my favorite. Will definitely come back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,197,The Facebook photos were enough to make me take on rush hour traffic for a hotdog. Totally worth the 1.5 hours it took to go 5 miles.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,198,Usually when I think hot dog I think disappointing and not very good. What they did with hot dog is on a whole other level this place is awesome. And my girlfriend found the taco she couldn t find anywhere else in Austin that she loves
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,199,The best hotdogs and quesadillas in Austin  no joke. The tacos are something else  also. It s all good and the couple that own the place are awesome. Eat here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,200,Super friendly services  the boss explained me throughly on some of the top sellers.  Items selected  hot dog all the way  without beans   steak burrito. It s about average  nothing stood out for a  5 hot dog. The bread was different  but the hot dog tasted like  3 a dozen pack from Walmart.  Steak burrito was very filling. Lots of steak  it was good for two people.   The place is a bit hidden  it s behind the buildings in a food trucks court. Plenty of parkings.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,201,It s awesome  The best hot hogs in the whole state  I come every time I m in town from Houston  And of course the customer service is the best  And love the Atmosphere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,202,Awe finally  Coming from Arizona  I missed those Sonoran hot dogs. They are just simple hotdogs loaded with lots of goodies like beans  bacon  and the sauces lol...but they taste great  I used to love going to those guys pushing the little carts and ordering these hotdogs in AZ.  Well  we finally have one in Austin. I was actually searching for one last December but there weren t any. These guys just moved here about six months ago from Tucson AZ. So these are the real thing...  So  for all you AZ and Southwest transplants...we have Sonoran hotdogs...I just had my first two...lol   Thanks for listening...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,203,Oh man  the time that it took me to eat this passed by way too quickly   I kid you not as I was driving away it felt like a dream that never really happened.  I had to stop myself from turning around to get another one just to prove that it happened   I was a little worried about parking as with any food trailer park but  I easily found I spot in their tiny parking lot.  The food park is quaint and fenced in with 3 large picnic tables.  I walked up to the window and the nice lady  owner  explained to me how they do the hot dogs and I ordered it the way they do it and purchased a pineapple water  2.00  the flavor of the week    I opted to pay  6.00 for a Hebrew National hot dog as opposed to the  5.00 one.  They also have other menu items so it isn t just hot dogs   I am going to try to remember all the toppings here   hot dog wrapped in bacon  tomatoes  onions  beans  mayo  mustard  jalapeno sauce....darn I think I am missing one or two   I sat down and waited for my food and thoroughly enjoyed that pineapple water  so much that I probably could have drank a liter by myself.  The fruit was freshly squeezed and you could tell they made it themselves.  Also  enjoyed that they gave you a glass filled to the brim with ice which was nice and refreshing   The man  other owner  brought me out my hot dog and of course I took the obligatory picture   The flavors were so  good  this is the part where I start dreaming  I couldn t help but  take bite after bite.  I was done in a matter of 2 minutes and I could probably win some hot dog eating contest if these were involved.  The toppings were nice and diced and everything was well balanced in the way of flavor   Nothing was too overpowering  sweet  spicy and the beans really gave it something extra   I am normally not someone who lets people put tomatoes or mayo on a hot dog but  you won t be disappointed if you get it the way it comes   I also enjoyed the grilled pepper that it came with but  beware it is hot   The bun was also great and I loved the way it hugged the hot dog and the toppings the whole way through.  This way you don t end up with a mess all over you   I am glad this place is right around the corner from where I live but  that also makes me want to cry because I will keep eating it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,204,Wow is all I can say  Best hot dog I have ever had in my life. Seriously. Chef is an amazing guy. Really cares about what he serves. What a surprise. Come and have your taste buds blown away 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,205,I got to go back here again   The sonora hot dog was something special. Super unique and tasted amazing. The carne asada burrito...was so so good. I need to go back for this specific menu item.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,206,If you want to eat something that s gonna change your life you ve come to the right place. Order the hot dog con todo with an order of ranch fries  You can never go wrong with T Locs. The owners are super friendly and the food is so delicious you ll definitely be coming back for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,207,Fantastic hot dogs    I brought my husband here after seeing decent reviews on Yelp and we were not disappointed. This place is a food truck  nestled just off Burnett next to two other food trucks. The owner is an awesomely nice guy who we talked with briefly while placing our orders. My husband got two premium dogs  and I got a regular dog sans the jalapeno sauce.  Honestly  I didn t think I d like everything on the dogs but I really wanted the authentic experience so I went with the flow  and I m glad that I did. All of the ingredients were very fresh and it all tasted great  even together. Kudos - we ll be back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,208,After a day of errand-running  my husband and I stopped by to pick-up a quick dinner. I had originally dismissed the trailer  parked across Burnet from the Allandale HEB  because it looked more like a slick state fair truck than the purveyor of deliciousness and hospitality that it is. Fortunately  I had noticed some Yelp love and made a mental note to check it out.  We munched our way through the premium hot dog  con todo   i.e.  beans  jalapeno sauce  mustard  mayo  diced tomato  and caramelized onions   oohing over the steamed bun  I know some find it soggy  but I loved it  and ahhing over the bacon-wrapped dog with all of the fixings. We also tried the carne asada burrito  which was equally flavorful  filled with nicely seasoned meat and mashed avocado  served with red and green salsas to your liking. You really can t go wrong with either savory pick  but I recommend going with a friend who likes sharing food so that you can sample both.  The service is so friendly. You just have to love a couple who made their dream a reality and somehow manages to work in very close quarters with smiles on their faces. I also appreciate Miguel s pride in his food - he made sure to show us our  to go  hot dog before bagging it so we could see how perfectly dressed it was in case it got mucked up on the drive home. Sonora s excellence really is in the details.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,209,I m in a great mood today. Let me share with you how I really think. I ll keep this short   I pretty much see food for its nutritional value  and no matter how beautifully crafted  seasoned  or presented it is  at the end of the day it s in one hole and out the other. Consume too many empty calories and you get fat. Sorry  we can t defy the laws of physics.  So when you re reading my Yelp reviews  and I m blathering how some place is so wonderful or whatever  keep in mind it s less about the food and more about the experience  Am I feeling welcomed  Am I having a great time  Do I enjoy being here  And if you text me with  Let s go there tomorrow  would I respond   Cya there   If you know me in real life  you know I m usually pretty easy.  So here s what I really think about Sonora Hot Dogs  It s a couple working a trailer living their dream. There is absolutely nothing I admire more than people who are so passionate and excited about what they re doing you can actually feel it. Do I really care about a hot dog or burrito  No. Would I go out of my way to come here for a hot dog or burrito  You bet. It s one small step for me  but one giant leap in my World of Mankind. Anything is as good as you want it to be. Everyone should be living their dream. An easy five stars from me.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,210,We really liked this place when we went for the first time on Wednesday afternoon before dropping off one of our moms at that airport  she wanted to go to a food truck for her last meal in Austin  so we took her to this park by our house and she picked the place .  We had never heard of T-Loc s before  but it must be some big thing in Tucson. We got two hot dogs  one Hebrew National and one veg  and all shared the buttermilk ranch fries. The buns were better than the typical cardboard stuff you get  they re allegedly FedExed in  and there was a good amount of toppings. The fries were seriously delicious--and they give you a massive amount. The moms enjoyed her torta.  Service was friendly and quick  and prices seemed on point with what you got. Overall  a big hit with the family and we d be happy to recommend it and go back again.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,211,What makes a place five stars   It s not rocket science.  Generally  if I can t wait to tell the wife about it  crave it days later and need to return  and can t think of anything I would change there...  The embarrassing reality   When my wife wanted to stop at a clothing sale on Burnet last Saturday  just south of 2222 Koenig  I was initially sad that I couldn t find a parking spot  so I dropped her off at the door.  Then I made  lemon aguas frescas  out of those lemons by determining that I could get to Sonora Hot Dogs  and slam down a delightful dog before the wife even noticed I was gone     And folks say I lack vision...  Michael and his lovely wife   I wish I was better with names   who own the T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dog trailer  came to Austin via Tucson  AZ  near the Mexico border state of Sonora.  Hermosillo  Sonora  is where the sublime goodness of the bacon-wrapped dog was invented.  To keep things as authentic as possible  they even source their bread from Tucson.  And when he describes his hunt for just the right jalapeno  a white jalape o   his passion shows.  And you can t find more friendly service.    Every bite of the hot dog  with it s mayo and mustardy  jalape o-sauced  onion and tomatoey goodness  is eye-rollingly good.  And don t forget the beans which give it a unique edge as well.  When I described my poor gluten-free wife s inability to enjoy a hot dog in a bun  or a burrito in a flour tortilla  he said to  just bring her by .  On a cloud-cooled evening  we decided it would be a good time for a little roadside dining.  Even though I d only met him once almost two weeks before  as soon as we walked up Michael said he d be more than happy to throw together a couple not-exactly-on-the-menu tacos from the also very yummy burrito ingredients  paired with some corn tortillas he just happened to have handy.    Great food Cheap prices Local and friendly ownership Thirst-quenching aguas frescas and horchata Easy parking  What more could I ask for   Ok  maybe air conditioning.      4.998 stars.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,212,Just like they do it in Tucson but right here in Austin. Quality ingredients  quality people  quality food. So solid 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,213,Best Sonora dogs in Texas hands down. The bread is brought over from Mexico  and let me tell you it really makes this place stand out from any run of the mill hot dog spot. A Sonora starts at 6 bucks with the fixings and definitely a bang for your buck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,214,Carne asada taco  chuco taco  and Sonoran style hot dog are all phe-nom-enal    If you want authentic style Mexican look no further. This is as good as it gets y all. I will dream of this taco until I have it again. Remember the carne asada taco won the 2019 Austin National Taco Championship 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,215,Excellent tacos  The carne asada tacos were on point  The chuco tacos were amazing  Get off of your butt and go try this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,216,Got the fish tacos which is currently a special please please make them permanent  I m not going to lie I ve lived a good chunk of my life in California which is fish taco land and so I went in super skeptical but they were delicious   Also love the little side garnish of pickled veggies it made me feel like I was back in San Diego  The people who run the truck are super sweet and clearly care a lot about their food and their customers I will definitely be coming back to try to the whole menu. Also helped my friend devour his carne asada fries which were so good it was hard to be polite and only eat a few.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,217,I first had my first taste of a Sonoran Hotdog in Tucson  when I lived in AZ.  One bite and there s no going back. And no other hotdog will ever come close.  Street food at its finest and legend has it that it originated in Sonora in the 80 s. You could only find them in Tucson and in some areas of Southern Arizona...that is until now.... We stumbled upon T Locs when we were driving around in Austin  Texas.  I almost fainted when I spotted the sign.  This little food truck is LEGIT.  They have their Bolillo bread Fedexed everyday from Tucson for their particular  dog .   Yes  they also have tasty burritos and tortas but why would you not order their famous Sonoran Hotdog   I live for them   I dream of them   I obsess about them   I count them in my sleep   And Mike the owner remembered me from 2 years ago.  Yes  I was that crazy lunatic woman that inhaled 3 in one sitting all the while moaning like Andrew Zimmern after each bite.  Now about that GLORIOUS hot dog   Nope  not just any ole hotdog but one wrapped in succulent crispy bacon.  Oh yeah   Piled high with pinto beans  tomatoes  green salsa  jalape o  mustard  mayonnaise  avocado and cotija cheese on top.  TRUST ME   Try one.  You ll think you ve died and gone to heaven   I thought I did.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,218,Finally got the chance to get to this place. These hot dogs are amazing. Sonoran style and you have to try the ranch fries  amazing. I was really impressed. We ll be back for sure.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,219,At first I didn t want to try the Mexican hotdog but then Miguel told me just to try it  The hotdog was so good the combination of the toasted bun the beans the bacon it was the best hotdog I ve ever had I ve definitely go back
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,220,Miguel  Zulma and Mom are amazing. I ve been having these hotdogs for a few years now  never gets and never disappoint. Amazing people serving amazing food. Not only are they super kind but they remember who you are. Love them and will continue to come every Saturday.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,221,This food truck is absolutely amazing in every way possible.   From the moment I stepped up to place my order  I was greeted with a friendly  smiling face. The menu is simple  hot dogs  burritos  and quesadillas.On my first visit  last week   I ordered the carne asada burrito which included delicious and perfectly cooked beef  avocado  and pico de gallo. It came with a lime half  as well as salsa roja and salsa verde  both of which were fresh and tasty. The couple that own the business were extremely outgoing and friendly  asking me how I heard of them and explaining to me that they packed up and moved from Tuscon  AZ to start this new adventure here in Austin. They were genuinely pleased and grateful that I came to try their food.   After I ordered food  I saw that they offered aguas frescas  which I has never tried but knew my coworker loved  so I ordered one to bring to my friend. They have different flavors every week  and that week it was watermelon. As soon as she tasted it  she told me how incredible and authentic it was and insisted I try it. IT WAS HEAVENLY..crisp  sweet watermelon flavor with fresh sliced mint leaves. I could have kicked myself for not ordering one for myself  but swore I would get one next time.   Fast forward to to today  when I returned for yet another carne asada burrito  I swear I ll try the hot dog and quesadilla soon  . The burrito was delightful and satisfying as usual  and was enough to completely fill me up. I was surprised that the owners remembered me from my visit a week ago. I was greeted with a friendly   Hi  welcome back  What will you be trying today   I ordered the burrito because  dammit  I was craving it  The aguas frescas flavor of the week was mango  and even though I LOVE mango  I said I d pass and get it again when they had watermelon. They were so incredibly nice that they gave me a sample cup  very decent size  of the mango to try it anyway. It was delectable and I would certainly order it again.   They were thankful for my return visit and shining with delight that I has enjoyed their food so much. I couldn t find anything bad to say about the owners or the food if I tried. I m so glad I found this place  will certainly recommend it to everyone I know  and plan to return again with regularity. Thanks Sonora  Y all are great  and welcome to Texas 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,222,Amazing food. You got to get the premium dog and the cheese fries. Best fries I ve ever had in my life.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,223,The hot dogs are great. I had to have a second one. But the burrito is awesome. Tons of carne asada  great homemade tortillas  pico  and guacamole. Served with half a lime and salsa roja or verde. Just the right amount of heat.  This Mexican girl is happy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,224,Incredible place. Incredible Food. Incredible Owners. It s no accident this place is so highly rated.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,225,If you re already on here just stop reading and go.   Get the hot dog  con todo . You won t regret it. They ship their buns tortillas from Tucson - where the Sonora hot dogs originate. This is a serious stuff  guys.   Oh and their limonada compliments it perfectly.   Enjoy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,226,Legit AZ style carne asada. No frills  carne asada with smashed avocado and pico in a delicious tortilla. They get their tortillas and hot dog buns from Tucson  This place was worthy of taking the 5 minutes to write a review. You want good  legit  traditional AZ carne asada in ATX  this is the only place you can find it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,227,I really love this place  my favorite hot dog ever.  My wife always love the chiles g eros toreados that come with the food. Mike and his wife are super friendly. We will always come back to this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,228,A must go to destination in Austin.  Food is so amazing.  Gourmet dishes from a small little food truck.  The folks here truly put love into each dish they prepare.  If you can only choose one food truck to go to in Austin I highly recommend this one.  This establishment has been approved by the BIG KAHUNA.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,229,Finally passed by and noticed they were open  it appears this is week five of their opening. Super nice couple who are offering Austin the only actual Sonoran hot dog. I think there have been a few tries but never the real deal until now.  They offer a regular  premium and veggie dogs. Also a couple of burritos. So I ve tried the hot dog with everything. A Sonoran dog is wrapped in bacon  topped with beans  grilled onions  fresh onions  tomatoes  mayonnaise  cream sauce  mustard and jalapeno sauce with a roasted pepper. Mmm......bacon   The carne asada burrito with avocado was also just as good. I ll have to rotate what I get in the future. I was given a small tasting of an aqua fresca which they also have. She said melon  I was thinking specifically cantaloupe.    As of Tuesday  May 13th the new hours will be Tue-Sat 11a-10p. Closed Sunday and Mondays. This will make it easier to get a fix.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,230,Fantastic food and folks  My wife and I come here whenever we re in this part of town. The food is fresh and delicious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,231,I m going to be honest  my boyfriend and I were hesitant at first about trying this place out. We had the passbook and we were wondering if hot dogs were really going to fill us up  we re also not huge fans of what is usually considered mystery meat . We went to their website and saw their video  it convinced us to try it. We were so glad we did.  Their hot dogs rise above the stigma. They look beautiful  are packed with toppings  and are totally scrumptious. The special bread they use only elevates it s delciousness. We were impressed. Also the owners were so nice  You could tell they are passionate about what they do. They ship the bread from Arizona  but they plan to go there and learn how to make it themselves. They were also shocked about their high ratings online  They deserve it. Great Service. Great Food.  We got cups of their freshly made pineapple fresca. Oh my gosh  I wish I could have it everyday. We also ordered a burrito. It was packed with deliciously seasoned juicy meat. It s safe to say I love this food truck. I hope it sticks around for a while.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,232,The truck was a little difficult to find but it s worth it once you do. I had the Sonora hot dog and my partner had the Carne Asada and that was good as well. Very well seasoned. I would advise anyone to at least try it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,233,My wife and I were doing some shopping in the area and decided we were hungry. She looked on Yelp and said   there s a hotdog place close to hear that s supposed to be good.  I m not one to typically jump at the opportunity for a hotdog  but I like to try new things so I agreed. We went to Sonora hot dogs at an off time in the afternoon  so it wasn t busy at all. We were greeted by the friendly owner  can t remember his name . He chatted with us for a while as he prepared our food. We split the Sonora hot dog and the Carne Asada burrito. I was blown away by the hot dog. Every ingredient is extremely high quality which resulted in a perfect blend of flavor. The bun was the best bun I ve ever tasted  which sets up the flavor for the entire hotdog.  We ve gone back a second time and our looking forward to our next return. Give Sonora Hot Dogs a try and you ll be back for many more visits 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,234,My wife and I are from Phoenix so we know what a good Sonoran Hotdog is supposed to taste like and T-Loc s dogs are even better. Definitely the real deal. The owner and his wife are wonderful people and always the best hosts.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,235,I went for the the hotdog. It is awesome  wonderful flavor without being overwhelming  as much as I like Chicago style dogs  they can be a bit much . Served on a soft gourmet bun and with a perfectly grilled spicy pepper  If you are there for the hotdog  that is what it is  just one style of hotdog. If you are looking for a variety of toppings and styles  this wouldn t be the place. But that one dog  it is wonderful.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,236,This place has the best hotdogs you ll ever eat and the carne asada fries are really good as well. The guy who cooks the food is really nice and you can tell he cares about the food he serves just by tasting it. If in Austin you should really go try them out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,237,This place is amazing  Had the Con Todo and it was the best hot dog I ve ever eaten  The Ranch Fries were also great. Go to this trailer now 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,238,This place is fantastic  I am a vegan and Miguel was super accommodating. They were out of the veggie hot dogs and he instead made us a bean burrito and two vegan cheese tacos  which would have been much more expensive than one hot dog. He even took extra time to create a cute presentation on our plates. The food was amazing and came out very quickly. Miguel is incredibly kind and is very attentive and fun to chat with  This food trailer deserves to be much more famous. I highly recommend you check it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,239,This place wins on so many counts.  I had never heard of a  Mexican  hot dog and had no idea what to expect.  Also the idea of another food truck in Austin trying to do some fusion always makes me kind of skeptical.  This place really met my expectations all around and even surpassed them.   I had the premium dog  which taste wise was amazing.  I have never had such a unique and tasty hot dog.  But apart from the food which I think all can agree on here is really fantastic the service was great and very friendly.    I will most certainly be returning and I think this place might become a regular spot for me 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,240,Lived in Tucson for a little bit and this style dog is the number one thing I missed. This gem is tucked off burnet road close to 49th. If you miss the turn in...turn around. It s worth it 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,241,Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Hot dogs are my favorite food. Born and raised in Chicago- which has hotdog stands on every corner. And this place was great. The owner was a sweetheart- great service and very friendly. The tacos and loaded fries were also amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,242,Hidden Gem  Small menu because they do what they do so well. Don t ever change  Owner is a great guy too 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,243,This is my place to go for Sonoran style hotdogs. Plus they do a mean carne asada burrito and fries  I definitely recommend them. You won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,244,Miguel knows how to throw down a hot dog and a carne asada burrito.  My hubs and nephew got the carne asada burrito and both stated they were excellent. Flavorful  meat was tender  avacado was delicious. Lots of meat. Tortilla was amazing.   My Sonoran Hot Dog I had to  try the  5 vs  6. Both tasted great with a delicious heavenly bun  beans  mustard  mayo  jalopeno sauce with tomatoes and onions. Both dogs were wrapped in bacon. But I think the hebrew national took the gold. It had a better flavor despite having the same dressings. I would go with the hebrew national.  My watermelon mint agua fresca was great.   I only wish for 2 things. The beans on the hot dog were delicious and I wish they were offered in a smaller item than a bean and cheese burrito. The second a fresh side to go with the hot dog. I wasn t quite full with 1  but the 2nd one was too heavy.   I will go back and tackle the other items. Miguel informative and our customer service was awesome 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,245,Lives up to the hype   The customer service blew me away.  Also  the wind did  as well.  I m not really a hot dog guy  to be honest.  That being said  I ordered a premium Sonora Dog and it was the best hot dog I ve had in years.  Now  the burrito was the real star  for me.  I love burritos with all of my being.  So. Good.  The salsas and concoctions that came with the burrito were also a special treat.  They re across the street from my apartment and I ll definitely be back.  I cannot stress how well the staff treats the customers.  They deserve 6 5 stars for the treatment we received.    Hot dog lovers  Do it up   Burrito connoisseurs  consume mass quantities 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,246,I ordered the hot dog with everything.  Very good.  The people running the trailer were very friendly and helpful.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,247,Now this is my kinda place  A food truck with hot dogs and burritos. Yes please  The hog dog was absolutely delicious nothing that I have ever had before every component was spot on. The burrito was very simple but less is more and in this case it definitely was. Not only was the food great but the service was awesome  The guy who owns this place was very welcoming and took great care of us. We will be going back for sure. If you haven t checked this place out yet your missing out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,248,Reminds me of Tucson.  The owner chef is a great guy. The price for a Sonoran Dog might seem high to the uninitiated... but if you ve had a Sonoran Dog before  it s completely worth it. On my second time back  I also picked up a carne asada burrito- closest thing to a burrito I d get in Tucson  Chipotle Freebirds falls more into the Subway category for me .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,249,There are two top hot dogs in town and Sonora is one of them.  Hot dogs n stuff by Lowes on Shoal Creek is the other.  But let s get to the point here.  I ve been several times  and ...  Gilberto from Houston - you re an idiot.    You bust out one star because the price is a buck too much for you   Stay in Houston  please.  We don t need more A  holes in Austin.  Did you actually taste the dog   Did you know the buns are fed exed in from AZ   Did you actually chat up the awesome owners to find out what they had to offer you salsa wise   obviously not.  moron.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,250,An absolute must. The hot dogs are perfect every time. However the Carne Asada Burrito is best in the City. The whole menu is a safe bet. I don t know about the veggie dog as im a true Texan.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,251,Downright amazing. If you enjoy great food and a taste that s too die for   you owe it to yourself to visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,252,Just had my first Sonoran Hot Dog this evening. It was one of the best hot dogs I ve ever eaten. The taste combination of the dog along with the roasted pepper was superb. This trailer might be hard to see from the road because it is set back from the road  but it is directly across from the Sonic Drive In.   Miguel was manning the trailer this evening. He s a pretty cool guy to hang out with too and talk motorcycles with.  Having a choice between Sonic and Sonora Dogs  I will always go to Sonora from now on.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,253,One of my favorite places to stop after work   Great food  fast friendly service  great food.... Yeah  get the Deluxe Dog all the way   Perfect    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,254,I highly recommend getting the veggie hot dog wrapped in bacon. It s like you re being healthy but with a little something extra. You haven t lived until you ve at least one of their hot dogs. And the carne asada burrito was really good. The meat was nicely charred and the tortilla was huge  So worth the  .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,255,Didn t disappoint. Hotdog is flavorful and the bread is incredible. Going in you think it s going to be a heavy dog but you ll want to get two  Owner is really nice and friendly. He explained everything really well and even gave up extra roasted jalape os to kick it up a notch. Highly recommend you try this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,256,One more five star review for Miguel. This hot dog cart is no joke   I got the Kosher dog wrapped in bacon...because Kosher. You don t really notice the bacon after it has cooked down except in the flavor of the dog.   I also got a burrito which was really good as well. There is homemade guacamole in there and the house salsas are really good too.   Each order comes with a Santa Fe pepper that has been appropriately seasoned and grilled. It s a great touch for a  simple  hot dog stand.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,257,Sonora Hot Dogs is the perfect embodiment of everything I love about local businesses. The husband and wife team who own this trailer are absolutely lovely and the passion they have for making good food really shows. There are no subpar hot dogs here as every hot dog served is carefully crafted with the utmost attention.   I got a premium dog because I am a sucker for Hebrew National dogs and got everything on it. Try the Sonoran style at least once - it might sound like too much  but everything just works. They cut the bun in such a way that stuff is not dripping out of either end while you eat - I LOVE this. Truly brilliant and I wish every hot dog bun came cut that way. The grilled pepper they give you on the side  So tasty. The cucumber aguas frescas was super refreshing and downright delicious.   I could spend my money absolutely anywhere  but it feels nice to know that I spent it somewhere local  helping to support a small business with kind  hard-working owners. There s just something I really love about supporting good people in achieving their dreams. Feels good  man.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,258,I ve been eating these dogs for a long time.  They are as good as I ve ever had. The ingredients are well thought out and the roasted pepper is purfect on the side. Can t wait until July 28th  National Hot Dog Day.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,259,I love that this place has veggie hot dogs and other vegetarian options  The customer service is excellent. We had their veggie hot dogs  ranch fries without the bacon and because it was our first time the owners made us their vegetarian taco to try and it was delicious  We will definitely be back for some more yummy food 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,260,I had the Sonoran dog and it was excellent. I asked him to give me their most traditional Sonoran dog and it did not disappoint. My buddy had the torta and it was fantastic as well.  Good spot to try on a nice day. The owner was very cool and chatted with us about the history and food in general. Very knowledgeable and nice guy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,261,Great loses up hot dog  great taco  very fresh ingredients  great service. I highly recommend this place
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,262,I LOVE THIS PLACE      The food is AMAZING  super delicious always fresh  fast  and the service is fantastic too. The owner  Miguel is awesome. He is a fantastic host. There s always good music and a nice ambiance. I recommend this place from the bottom of my heart
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,263,Be forewarned   two prime dogs  made with Hebrew National Franks  and two Topo Chicos commanded  17 . Yeah. For two hot dogs. Hmmm... this seems quite steep after growing up with the always delicious James Coney Island in Houston. Still....  they are delicious hot dogs. I ordered the  Con Todo.  Not sure what the beans add to it... the rest made a wonderful goopy mess  but the real star was the bun  which seems to be more grilled or toasted than merely steamed. I would like another hot dog right now  but next time I need a fork to scoop everything that fell off.  Friendly service  pleasant shady place to sit. A few flies  but at least no mosquitoes.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,264,Classic  authentic Mexican hot dogs. Staple food truck to expand your Mexican palette.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,265,First time here. Driving from McAllen back to Dallas. Nice people  good food  awesome pineapple Agua Fresca. Could not ask for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,266,This was literally one of THE BEST hotdogs I ve ever had    I had two of the Sonorans with all the magic. The glorious bacon wrapped hotdog  beans and the tomato  onions and hints of salt just to name a few... and all on a bun that is so perfect it defies description    I ordered two and thought I might have gone too deep... but a handful of minutes later and they were both gone without a trace. Light and delicious  I could have had 4 more. To top it off super cool people who run it and a real cool vibe  this spot just made my regular list
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,267,Delicious hot dog  I had the Hebrew National  wrapped in bacon  with the beans  and salsa. The bun was toasty and good all on its own. We came here with the Austin Passbook and we ll definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,268,Amazing hotdog  fantastic burrito made by the best lady i have ever met. Thank you for a great service  We will definitely come back for more.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,269,BEST HOTDOG EVER    BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE    COOKED WITH LOVE      We arrived just 25 mins before closing ... And not only did he not turn us away  he made us the best hot dog in Austin  and you can totally tell it was made with love to perfection. Anyone that is jammin to music while cooking is good wit us      Thank you     
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,270,The bun has to be the best part of their hot dog. Definitely the bacon wrapped around the weiner is a Sonora touch with the toppings  but the beans are such a Tucson  AZ thing  Overall  I d come back here con mis amigo de Mexico. Also  the staff here are so charismatic and they speak Spanish
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,271,Just finished one of their carne asada burritos and the kids had a couple of the hot dogs and we couldn t be happier. Delicious and slightly spicy they made us all very happy campers.  I also wanted to note that my battery died while sitting in the lot and the owner graciously gave me a jump and sent me on my way.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,272,If you have been to Guero Canelos in Tucson.....well you can get the same taste right here in Austin  Texas.    Definitely must check out and enjoy their Sonoran hotdogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,273,I visited T-Loc s Sonoran Style Hot Dogs last night as part of Austin s Truck and Trailer food festival Truck By TruckWest. Their signature entry into the competition was a simply phenomenal hot dog wrapped in bacon and served in the softest  most awesome bolillo-type roll I may have ever tasted. Topped with pinto beans  diced tomatoes and onions  mustard  a squiggle of mayonnaise. It may not sound amazing when I describe it like that but let me tell you  it is fan-F CKING-tastic    I mean it. This is hands-down the best hot dog I have had in years  bar-none.  It was served to us by the super-cool proprietor  Mike Kaiser  who graduated from Le Cordon Bleu and who used to work at Thomas Keller s renowned Per Se restaurant. He was way nice. Laid Back. Eager to talk about his beloved creation and all around an exemplary host. I learned from him that  T-Loc  stands for  Tucson Local. Which I thought was some pretty awesome representin  of his home set. And that those awesome rolls are FedExed in from Arizona daily  Seriously  Along with the special tortillas he uses in his burritos. This place is a must visit if you have EVER liked hot dogs. You gotta go get some. This is best new thing in hot dogs you can get 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,274,I think my friends like me a whole lot more after introducing them to Sonora Hot Dogs.  We pulled up right after open- it was easy enough to find and there was ample parking. As I inspected the menu board I overheard a patron exclaim   Man  that was awesome  You made a believer out of me   Oooh  good sign   I ordered a veggie dog con todo sans onions along with a bean and cheese burrito. Was I that hungry  No  but I had to try it all. The orders did take a while to arrive  but I m pretty sure it was the owner working by his lonesome. When the food did come  it was well worth it.  As I ve seen other reviewers remark  the extreme toppings stay in the bun perfectly somehow.. it defies nature  Although the plethora of ingredients seem overwhelming  the mustard  mayo  tomatoes  beans  and jalapeno sauce compliment the dog so  so well. The bun was PERFECTLY soft and chewy and every bite was perfect- even the ones outside of the realm of the regular sized hot dog. The pepper on the side was roasted and dusted with salt  the perfect spiciness that when shredded on the hot dog  really enhanced the flavor.  The burrito was okay. standard beans and cheese in a tortilla  but the tortilla was AWESOME. You don t find tortillas like this in Austin  This dish could be greatly improved with just an addition of salsa  I was given a side of the hod dog s jalapeno sauce  but it was much too watery for the burrito .  At the end of the meal there were many exclamations-  Good call Katie   and  OH GOD  that bun was good   They were right. Other sausage establishments may cater to meat craftsmanship or wow factor  but Sonora doesn t need that- they ve got the right flavor and they re letting it roll.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,275,OMG     Everyone NEEDS to eat here     You are missing out if you haven t had their food yet. My favorites are the Sonora Hotdogs and the Carne Asada Fries  The owner is awesome    Really makes the visit more enjoyable  Really a must stop if you re looking for the best food in town
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,276,I will drive from Leander for these   I ve had Sonoran hot dogs in Tucson and these are the real thing  Get you one 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,277,Do you like hot dogs  I hope so because why else would you come here  These hot dogs taste bombastic.   You can also get a quesadilla or even a premium hot dog that uses Hebrew national dogs instead of the bars type. And yeah they come topped with a lot of stuff so tackling even one hot dog will be a task.  They make hot dogs more yummy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,278,I grew up in Tucson on Sonoran Dogs  but somehow Miguel uses such better ingredients that you can totally taste the difference  which is why his are better than any I ve ever had in Tucson or Mexico  even Guero Canello and street vendors.   He s also expanded his menu to include ranch fries  think Eegee s but with real bacon  and AZ CA carne asada and breakfast burritos. I seriously missed breakfast burritos until t-locs came around  no offense Austin breakfast tacos  I love you too  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,279,This place is a must-go-to.  I love their quesadillas.  Best ever   The tortilla they use is very tasty and they aren t stingy with the meat.  The overall taste is really terrific.  I think the quality of cheese they use is part of the greatness.    The owners are really fantastic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,280,Trailblazing the frontiers of the Sonoran style in Austin. Truly pushing the envelope on what is possible.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,281,This may come as a surprise to some  but wienies are not on my regular diet.    I don t have kids and I don t eat fast food much so hot dogs and burgers are easily avoided to save my waistline.  However  this place keeps  starring   on my Yelp feed and it s in BFF s  hood  so we decided to try it.    Have I mentioned that BFF has a  touch  of OCD   So  he of course read each review and had a plan going in.  He was gonna get one Sonoran dog and one carne asada burrito.  I only wanted to eat one of those so I opted for the dog since I so rarely get to eat those.    We found the  tiny  trailer easy enough but only because it s a trailer.  There s no big sign saying what it is but it s in a parking lot with the Conscious Cravings trailer and some picnic tables so it s easy to spot.  We both knew we wanted the fresh agua fresca and the flavor that day was cucumber.  That was so good and refreshing and had me pining for some vodka to spike it  or  as suggested by the sweet cook  some Hendricks Gin .    The wait for food was not too long but just enough to know it was made fresh and to empty our cucumber waters.  I had some cash out to buy another glass when they said the first refill was on the house.  THANKS      Back at BFF s apt  we could not wait to dig in.  I will admit that  while I thought the hot dog was really good  I was blown away by the burrito.  And if you like heat  the grilled pepper that comes with the dog can be shredded and added to it for a nice kick  and the red sauce with the burrito will hurt so good  but I preferred the tangy green  tomatillo   sauce.  My only complaint with this trailer is I wish they would offer sides.  One dog was not enough  but two would have been too much  so I opted to get a couscous salad from CC next door.  And  I ll just reiterate  I wish Sonora would offer sides.  I choked down a few bites of that just to make me feel healthy and crunchy but blech.  So Sonora  even just a bag of chips would be sufficient.  Or  maybe a bowl of your beans  I did ask for a side of beans and they misunderstood and put my dog beans in a tiny cup on the side .    I have no doubt I ll be back  with a flask  for more of that agua fresca and a burrito.  I ll just pretend the guacamole in the burrito is my healthy helping of greens.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,282,What a taste treat   I enjoyed my first Sonora hot dog today and it was soooo good  the only problem was I ate it too fast   I got the premium Hebrew National dog with everything except mayo and it was very  very  very good.  I took a carne asada burrito home for later  but only half of it made it to my refrigerator.  The drink was a blend of orange juice  blended strawberries and a little sugar and it was perfect.  Very friendly service from the family run business.  Highly recommended 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,283,I was super skeptical the very first time I came here and a friend said....do you trust me  Oh my God it was absolutely amazing the best hot dog I ve ever had the burrito was to die for. So let me start by by saying not only do I not like beans which comes in the Sonoran con Todo but I don t like pico de gallo  which comes on the burrito. I have now referred at least 50 people to this place because it is that amazing I love his Sonoran hot dog and I love his burrito and his fresh pico de gallo and his roasted peppers are amazing
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,284,While I like variety  I also like places that have only a few items on their menu and do them well.  I got their premium hotdog which consisted of jalapeno sauce  mayo  mustard  onions  cooked or raw  I went with cooked   tomatoes  hebrew national dog wrapped in bacon  they have a veg dog option too  with pinto beans served on a perfect lightly toasted bun. After my first bite couple of bites I said   that s a damn good hot dog.  and it is. It looked like a work of art too. I was still hungry afterwards and while I really wanted another hot dog  I figured I d try their carne asada burrito too and it was pretty darn good in it s own right and they do not skimp out on the steak. They also gave me a little taste of their mango agua fresca which was very refreshing on a hot Austin day.  In addition to the hot dog  the stars of the show with out a doubt are Miguel and Zulma who make sure you feel welcomed  happy and full. They are the best   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,285,I see a lot of love in the reviews for the carne asada which I was not super impressed with but when a place has hot dog in the name  I only need them to do one dish well. This will easily be the best hot dog you ve ever eaten. Lots of places  elevate  hot dogs by serving sausages instead of hot dogs  looking at you Frank  and that s the easy way out. A sonora style hot dog takes ordinary hot dogs and turns them into art  or at least that s what they re doing in this truck. I ve never been to Sonora.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,286,Dang. Great hot dog. I hope these guys do well and stay around for a long time. Go for the signature Sonoran Dog  con todo . It was great. I wish I had gotten 2 cause now I m thinking about it all day    I added an aqua fresca  watermelon juice  that was a perfect compliment to the meal.    Really nice folks running the place too. I can t wait to return.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,287,My wife and I decided to give this place a try for lunch today.  The verdict   They re really tasty   Wrapping the hot dog in bacon adds some welcome chewiness and crunchiness to the texture  the condiments fit together well  and the bun has just a hint of sweetness.  It s definitely an awesome  unique  and valid approach to a hot dog  and I m glad I got to try it.  The pineapple water my wife got to drink was really good as well  lightly sweetened and with a touch of coconut.  So what s keeping me from giving it five stars   Value for money  mostly.  The Sonora dog with a Bar S hot dog is  5  but I suspect most people are going to pay the extra  1 to upgrade to a Hebrew National hot dog.  Based on the photos here  I was expecting the hot dogs to be a little bigger  maybe the size of a 1 4 pound dinner frank.  However  these are regular size hot dogs -- they don t cover the full length of the bun -- and if you re really hungry  one probably won t be enough.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,288,T-Loc hot dog all the way   -  Fantastic food  Great prices  very good service  Miguel made it feel more like a backyard cookout
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,289,I thought I hit up the Burrito and Quesadilla from this place being that I hadn t had solid Carne Asada in awhile. As soon as I unwrapped the Quesadilla and took a bite with some of the Guac I literally put it back in the box sat back and said  Oh hell yes  . Something so simple as a tortilla with cheese had so much flavor it was astounding. The guac  pico and salsa were on point and the burrito was a tremendous balance of ingredients. The quantity is spot on to because I had trouble finishing just my burrito but the food was so good I ended up eating the whole Quesadilla afterwards because I just couldn t wait  D.  The guy behind the counter  IDK if he was the owner  was very relaxed and easy going and there s a nice area to sit and chow down with umbrella s over the tables for shade. I can t recommend it enough and I haven t even tried the Hot Dog s yet  which looks just as spectacular . Great place 5 stars and I ll be going again .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,290,Awesome burrito. I had the Eggsplosion with cheese  and it was fantastic. Carne Asada  retried beans  some spice to it  and eggs that break while you re eating it. A great big  beautiful mess. Last week I had the loaded fries  which were also awesome. The guy who cooks it all up  T-Loc himself  maybe   is super friendly. I will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,291,Best Sonoran dogs in Austin. Are used to live in Tucson so I m very familiar with these and these are the best I ve ever had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,292,The best of the best   I m not a big fun of hotdogs but I will admit am addicted to hotdogs after today   the bun is yummy and taste is sweet spicy it s amazing   The guy that serves the fun  Miguel   I think he sure knows about a good customer service    Awesome guy   Great vibe and the music made me feel like home  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,293,If you like hot dogs  definitely come here and try that. A hot dog with onions  tomatoes  jalapeno sauce  beans I don t like beans actually but it fits to that hot dog   bacon and beef frankfurter. It is expensive for a hot dog  6.50  but worths it  Best of Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,294,Best hotdog I have every had in my life. Cool place to eat nice environment great place to have a nice lunch. Really recommend trying it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,295,Miguel and crew make a spot on Sonoran Hot Dog that would compete with the standards from our former home Tucson. The twist is he offers premium beef and vegetarian option for you fufu Austinites.  My only complaint would be I think the price point is high. Specifically for the Bar S dog    5. Then again  he sources the bun from AZ so the costs probably represent that.  Represent Miguel 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,296,Just finished scarfing down my Sonora dog and carne asda burrito... it was great   It was my first time getting food from there  and was extremely pleased to put it mildly.  It s a small little food trailer with a dining yard and 3 picnic tables.  I got a Sonora Hot Dog  which has a  bacon wrapped wiener  you can choose the type of wiener you want Bar S or Hebrew  with onions  mayo mustard  chopped tomatoes  grilled onions  jalapeno sauce  and beans.  This dog was out of sight.  I thought is was one of the absolute best hot dogs I ve ever had.  The presentation of it was pretty too.  The mayo and mustard are squeezed on  in a nice zig-zag-type way  instead of spread.  The roasted chile on the side is a great contrast to the hot dog s flavor.  After eating that  I could have been satisfied hunger wise... I went moderately hungry.    Of course  I also ordered the carne asda burrito b c when i go somewhere new  i order eat way too much b c I m afraid I may never make it back.  The burrito consists of a 1 2 pound of chopped steak w  mash avocado and fresh pico.  It was was equally pleasing in a totally different way.  My meat was very tender.  It came w  green and red sauce on the side.   The couple working were very welcoming and friendly.  I was offered a free sampling of the daily flavored water  today was hibiscus  I believe  I didn t clearly hear what flavor it was.  I will go back for sure.  You should go  NOW 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,297,As a Tucson native  these hot dogs are famous and not sold anywhere else. However  I have found them here in Austin. If you have not tried them  you MUST DO SO ASAP. They re absolutely delicious and t-locs does them perfectly. With amazing Tucson favorite foods served here  it s seriously not to be missed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,298,My girlfriend and I are regulars here for a reason they have the best hot dogs and carne asadas. Miguel the owner is a great dude and excellent chief same with his significant other. Highly recommend people try their food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,299,Any bad review has obviously never had an authentic Sonora hotdog. This place is amazing. I wish I could eat here for every meal. The burritos are to die for. The bread used in the hot dogs is all the way from Tucson  and there s a reason for it.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,300,What is a Sonora hot dog  I don t know but it was ah-mazing  Ok really it s this delicious style of hot dog that s popular in Arizona. I ve never had anything like it in Texas. They ship the bread in from AZ to keep it authentic. Light fluffy  slightly sweet bread  loaded with saucy beans and topped with a hot dog grilled in bacon then covered in mayo  mustard  ketchup  and diced tomatoes onions. I think there was something slight spicy too  maybe. Party of flavors in your mouth. I got hints of that classic childhood dish  frank and beans  but with a little zing. Topped mine off with a Mexican coke for  7. Mmm-hmm. Open till 10pm 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,301,I ve sampled everything on the menu now and I regret only that I can t rate them even higher. The Sonora hot dog that gives this place its name has a wonderful balance of ingredients that come together perfectly. Don t skip the grilled pepper - it s got just enough salt sprinkled on it to bring out the flavor delightfully  And yes  it s noticeably better with the Hebrew National hot dog  although still tasty with the Bar-S dog. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla are full of just-right beef and fantastic guacamole with no cheap but flavorless filler. The bean and cheese burrito is tasty  very filling  and somehow manages not to fall apart when you eat it. The cheese quesadilla is yummy and a perfect vehicle for allowing their flat out spectacular pico de gallo to shine. And the watermelon agua fresca I had with my order tonight was absolutely amazing - I can t imagine a better drink.  Wonderful food made with care. A glowing example of how truly magnificent a few humble items can be when prepared with the best ingredients and attention to detail.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,302,BEST HOTDOGS EVER. I was looking for a place that did a good street dog for a long time and AT LAST T-Loc s or Tuscan Locals is hands down the best hotdog around. This place is kinda hidden in a little food truck lot. Do yourself a favor and Visit Miguel for a hotdog  I had the  Con todo  premium dog. I would have taken a picture if I didn t inhale the hotdog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,303,If you haven t been here  please just go.  The food was delicious.  They know what they are good at and do it with excellence.  Service  cleanliness  quality  fun.  They don t currently offer sides simply because this is a traditional  Mexican  style street food vendor which don t serve sides  just delectable main dishes and refreshing drinks. Even the simple bean  amp  cheese burrito on homemade buttery  thin  amp  flaky tortillas is de-lish   But keep coming back  they ll add specials each season and you might even find a creative side dish  soup or Mexican Hot Chocolate for cooler months show up.  Zulema  amp  Michael are the perfect hosts and welcome you warmly to their casita.  Thanks you two for making a lovely date night with my prince so fun  - Richard  amp  Cobi  PS  Make sure you grab your wristbands for Truck by Truckwest and come check out Sonora Hot Dogs from Tuscon  AZ.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,304,I went here to eat try one of their hot dogs on a warm Saturday night and I was NOT disappointed. It was to die for   Nuf said. If you haven t gone here  please do yourself a favor and try it out.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,305,This trailer is great   The owner operating couple really love their food and it shows.   They serve best hot dog in Austin.   The bun is a wonderfully light  slightly sweet bread - not your standard bready hot dog bun.  You get your choice of dog including Veggie dogs.  The condiments range from the usual to tasty beans  onions  and  best of all  a roasted  amp  steamed blond pepper.  A perfect combination of ingredients which are seriously addictive. They have other options such as burritos and quesadillas but we cannot get past their veggie dogs   Also  their homemade aguas frescas are some of the best we have had.  They change weekly  this week was horchata and tamarindo - next week peach .  The aguas frescas alone will make us visit this trailer each week.  The couple that runs this trailer take the time to introduce themselves  discuss their food and its origin with previews of what is coming next week.   They remember what your preferences all while greeting you like old friends. They make a stop at this trailer truly extraordinary.   Very much worth a stop  you will be hooked - we are 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,306,Very very good    I tried the carne asada on a burrito and tacos  and it was very good  Have to return to taste the famous burrito... can t wait 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,307,Excellent  very very good    The hotdogs and the burros are awesome and authentic  Try the  aguas frescas    Im from Sonora   Mexican state  and this are the real deal  the bread is very good and the tortillas too  the food is delicious...everything is very clean  the service is awesome. Si tienen ganas de pasar un rato agradabe y comer muy rico no dejen de ir  los due os son muy amables  todo esta limpisimo y la comida los har  volver  Exito  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,308,This has quickly become my favorite trailer in Austin.  Miguel and his wife are great hosts who put customer service first.  Living in Tucson  I ve come to miss sonora dogs.  T-loc s satisfied my need to go back for a visit. The aqua fresca is amazing.  The Carne asada maybe the best burrito in Austin. The dogs are just like walking out of Guero Canelo in Tucson. Get to this trailer.  You won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,309,Wow  This little trailer really packs in the flavor. Hubby got  the best hot dog of his life.  Special bun with a bacon wrapped grilled hot dog topped with special mayo on a bed of beans and pico - add a grilled jalape o and you have a winner. I had the asada burrito and it was delicioso  The steak was grilled to perfection paired with guacamole on a fantastic tortilla. To be honest I didn t want to stop eating but I could not finish it- it is huge.  You won t be disappointed or hungry either.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,310,The guy manning the truck was super-friendly.  Truck was new  amp  super-clean.  I got the plain dog  no bacon   but with everything else.  It was good.  The onions were nicely grilled  amp  the dog was served with a very mid grilled pepper.  The bun was soft  too soft in my opinion as it made for rather a soggy dog with the beans.  Free sample of the Pineapple Horchata agua fresca was muy deliciouso - I could not stop gulping it.  I wanted to love this place  but like is the best I can give it.  Paid  5 for a dog  amp  I m still hungry.  Think I ll have to go back to my old reliable  chili-cheese dog next time I m craving a hot dog fix.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,311,The food here is great because the owners believe wholeheartedly in their product. Great ingredients  attention to detail and they love their customers. And not just because we are paying  they really like our southern open arms  y all  .   Their menu is well thought out. They have quesidillas for the kids and veggie dogs for those that don t  ya know  eat the meat. The salsa s good and pinto beans done to my liking. This is after-all the make or break of any joint selling Mexican cuisine.  And while I liked the Sonora Dog my shout-out goes to the carne asada burrito. That with the red sauce reminded me of my favorite southern californian joint  Juanitas.   Glad they moved to my hood. Try it  or just go buy and say howdy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,312,Yo  That hibiscus aqua fresca is no joke. I want forty of them.   This is my new favorite food truck. It s quick  it s damn good. The hot dog was great  and the burrito is a hidden gem. It s the perfect balance of carne asada steak  some guac and pico de gallo. The owner operators are a great addition to Austin -- super friendly and putting out great food.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,313,OMG Yes   For anyone who s lived in Tucson  or Sonora  this is a must when in Austin. I was a bit skeptical when reading they ship their bread in from Arizona  but upon trying it I was convinced. They don t make bolillos like that in Texas. The people who own it are super friendly too. Bear Down 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,314,This ain t no fast food dog  it s more of a culinary work of art. The bacon wrapped dog and toasted bun are excellent  and all of the other ingredients work perfectly. Nice clean food court off Burnet Road  easy parking  fast service  nice tables. It s a winner 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,315,meh.  I tried a Sonora dog  everything on it as recommended and thought it was decent. I d had plenty of worse hot dogs  but quite a few better ones as well. It s nice to have an option in Austin to get a Sonora-style dog but I ve had some this same style in Seattle that I thought were better. Worth trying if you re nearby and curious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,316,The food was fine. But  I feel like they should drop the  s  at the end  because it s misleading. They have exactly one hot dog. They have the same number of quesadillas and burritos - exactly one.  The guys were super nice. Their food is good. Still...  Our favorite hot dog joint went down about two months ago  and there s nothing like them anymore. We found Sonora while looking to fill that  hotdog partaking void   seeking the options of Sriracha  fried egg  chili  jalape os  sour kraut  bacon  or something like that.  There  you can have a Sonora  or a plain hotdog. So  a bacon wrapped dog with beans  amp  cilantro  or without  so  plain . Or  you can have a quesadilla or a burrito.  I can t say I won t go back  I very well may. But  I wish I d known what to expect before I drove there.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,317,Delicious   Not your average hot dog.  The bread and the mix of flavorings make this the best hot dog I ve ever had.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,318,I am from a city in Baja California that is an hour away from Sonora where they have this kind of hotdog everywhere. So when I found this place I thought it was too good to be true but this is as close as it gets to the real Sonora hot dogs and they taste amazing  The owner told me he brings the bread from Sonora  and I gotta tell you this bread is legit  The only downside is they re kinda expensive  like  6 for a hotdog con todo. I am biased though cause back home you get a hotdog WITH fries with all the toppings for  30 pesos  1.50 USD  lol. But everything in Austin is expensive so I probably will come back 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,319,Wow. Loved the sonora hotdog. The bun was light and crispy and the sausage had the right amount of saltiness and flavor. I really enjoyed the sauces they put on.  It looks like one man operation and the wait can be long  but i would say it is worth the wait. I wanna go back and try again soon.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,320,My new favorite hot dog  my boyfriend and I eat here weekly. The owner is so personable and obviously loves his job. These dogs taste like straight up happy. The buns are delish and the carne asada burrito don t play it will punch your appetite in the face  it s Good  amp  hearty
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,321, Much too good for children    Matilda - Ms. Trunchbull   That is how I feel each time I devour these hot-dogs  because I want them all  All to myself  They re SO frickin  tasty    I am all-things hot-dogs. Hot-dogs from Man Bites Dog  Chris  Little Chicago  R.I.P   Dog Almighty  Evil Wiener  El Salchichon  LOL - that cracks me up every time   Sonic  meh...   7-11  I know - why would I  right   - you name it  I ve have it. Seriously. There s no kind of sausage that hasn t been in my mouth. I ve had them all.  LOL    Once  a friend from Arizona  who moved to Austin  prepared a few of these for me and I got the sense of what they were  but - unfortunately for him - I was not heavily impressed and didn t understand the hype. It because there was something missing  is what he said. It was the bread. There is a special kind of bread which is ordered specifically for these hot-dogs  I was told by the owner  which means it s not available in Austin. IT IS  ALL  ABOUT THE BREAD.   Oh - and to keep you going back - they change up the fresh water with new flavors weekly. Yesterday  I got a sample cup  4 oz.  of melon juice...oh  my gosh  I loved it. You remember that scene from  Ace Ventura  When Nature Calls  when Jim Carrey walks into the room where all the body-less animal heads are mounted on the wall  and the camera is going around and around as he makes all those creepy and funny faces - with the loud mouthing he makes as he cringes and screams  THAT was how I reacted...in public. Ha   OK  so you better go try one. Or two. Or three. I m having three for dinner today.   - A member of the Wachati Tribe
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,322,Had my first Sonora Hot Dog and fell in love. It was fantastic. My only complaint is that the menu could use some smaller side dishes so that I don t completely wreck myself with an order of carne asada or ranch fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,323,These are some damn good dogs. The guy that runs the joint is super nice and the food  while it may sound a little weird  is so damn good.  That s all I have to say. Go eat here  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,324,Awesome dog. The flavors come together very well. I also grabbed a steak taco which was excellent.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,325,This place is great. My wife and I have been twice now  and it doesn t disappoint. The Carne asada tacos are amazing and so is the Sonora dog. We are from California and missing GOOD Mexican food  and now we have found it. Sorry  but we are not fans of Tex Mex. This place is is a must.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,326,T-Loc s is now serving breakfast and I may have found a replacement for a breakfast taco in the eggsplosion burrito. Carne Assada  received beans  pico and an over easy egg in that fabulous tortilla is now my go to breakfast. The new location on Burnett is super cute and has plenty of parking and a nice new playscape for the kids. There are a few other dining spots but why do you care when T-Loc s is right there 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,327,My wife and I found out about some Tucson Locals who decided to open up a Sonoran style hot dog stand out here in Austin.  Being someone who enjoys a good dog on a regular basis  I decided to check them out. Absolutely amazing  so much so that I had to get a second dog just to enjoy that taste again. The guy who runs the store does a great job with customer service.  I plan on going back when he opens up for lunch with a few guys from work.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,328,best Sonora dogos i have tried outside Sonora. worth the drive from home
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,329,Coming from AZ this place hits home. Sonoran hot dogs are a favorite of mine and this places does it right. If you have never had one of these fabulous dogs YOU MUST try this great place out   I will definitely be a repeat customer   This is a great addition to the Austin food scene.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,330,I had lunch here the other day and I dig it. Where else can you get a quality dog and a burrito at the same time  Well  I do miss my old hot dog stands in Chicago  but this will do for me  Still very unique and creative dogs to say the least  -Ed
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,331,Finally got to try this place  Two dogs is more than enough food for a large hungry guy. Get the dogs fully loaded  So much flavor packed into a handheld meal. Can t wait to come back. Didn t get the name of the lady behind the counter  but she was super nice and explained the food to us 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,332,The best hot dog place in town. The Sonora dog all the way is the only way to go. A mouth full of awesomeness in every bite. I don t get to make it down in this area too much but when I do it s on my list to eat at. There s several other things on the menu that look really good as well but I always go with the Sonora dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,333,Delish   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a   if this place was closer to my house I would probably be here daily.   Carne asada is fresh and the hot dogs are soooooooooooo amazing...... best dogs in town.  I challenge anyone to these amazing hot dogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,334,Wow the are awesome  the food and the people. I will always be looking forward to coming back again and again. The sonora hot dogs here are even better than the place I went to in Chandler  AZ. The owners are the friendliest people and superior customer service.  If you don t go here at least once  well you will have missed the best experience ever.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,335,DELICIOSO   I LOVE food trucks and wish that the world would hop onto the craze like this city but ohh well.  I was looking for a semi quick bite to eat while letting a friend nap at the hotel before we headed out  for SXSW  but still wanted something unique to the area.  Happy that me and the rest of my crew stopped here because it was AMAZING. Literally finger licking good  The owner is a really cool guy who makes sure you feel comfortable and I love the outdoor seating.   It s in a little parking lot with some other food trucks so that s cool too. Only reason it isn t 5 stars is because seeing that it s a food truck  not all the food handling is as wished  perfecto but it s still safe to eat  not dirty or anything. Just don t like how some stuff is kept warm   Happy eating   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,336,The Sonora-style hot dog is what the trailer is named after but the carne asada burrito is not to be missed. This is NOT the type of burrito bomb you d find at Chipotle. Here  it s a very thin tortilla wrapped around tender marinated steak  pico de gallo and avocado  and served with both red and green sauce and lime. The hot dog is awesome but the carne asada burrito steals the show. And don t miss the agua fresca. Just delicious 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,337,Went there today for the first time not knowing what to expect. Boy was I up for a nice treat  These hot dogs are something else. The presentation  amazing and when I took my first bite  I was blown away. They serve it with a freshly roasted chile of some sort and it was  hands down  the best hot dog I have...ever had  I got to talk to the owner  Mike  and he is super nice  took his time explaining everything about those hot dogs. Incredible.  Highly recommended and will be going back for sure.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,338,Exclusive 5 for the carne asada burrito. I was nervous about  smashed avocado  with  chopped steak  by itself. Every solid burrito I know has some essence of bean and rice. The cook modified my order for a fusion Sonora burrito and it was AMAZING. Lime on my burrito is not a new concept  but it s fresh and revived here at Sonora Hot Dogs. I was too distracted by satiation that I didn t even bother to savor the hot dog. I m not a fan of skinny dogs anyway. The burrito was much worth every delicious penny. Double the hot sauce next time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,339,I almost cried when they moved locations. But  Here they are and I m ecstatic  Are you from California  do you love carne asada burritos  I do. And here they are. In all their delicious  Robertos glory  No beans  rice  queso  nacho cheese  gravy  sour cream. It s just meat  lots of meat. Guacamole and pico. It s the best  8 I spend. Are you hungry yet 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,340,The carne asada burrito was BADASS    The green sauce is pretty amazing as well. I will definitely be coming back many many times in the near future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,341,Delicious best hot dogs iv had so far love it can never go wrong with the sonoran hotdog
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,342,Met the owner  very nice guy who chatted us up for a long time. It s cool to see a restaurant where the owners work so hard and are humble people. The food was fantastic and authentic. I ll definitely be back
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,343,This is our absolute go to spot. I love the food here. The service is great. The vegan vegetarian options are really good. Always go  con todo  on the dogs. It s the best. We are regulars and come weekly. Be sure to pickup a loyalty card. Try this place  you won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,344,Owner is Hella friendly and funny.  My dude loved their hot dog so much he had to have two.  That s alot of weiners for one man...  I think the bread is what makes it so special.  It s really toasted and chewy u just gotta try it to know what I m talking about.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,345,The pepper on the side is weird but i hate cooked peppers..hotdog itself is good...nothin special
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,346,Never thought I d be able to have a good Sonoran hotdog in Texas until I saw the name followed by a U of A sticker. Absolutely loved the Sonoran con todo. We also got hot chocolate from here  and it was better than any other I have tried. Great customer service as well as quick turnaround times. Highly recommend 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,347,This place totally sated my hot dog craving this afternoon. And that bun  Nice picnic tables with umbrellas. Will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,348,HOT DOG  This place is legit. It s been on my list for awhile and Mark M. has had nothing but rave reviews for this place. Mark  my husband and I were on Burnet hitting up happy hour. I was getting irritated because Mark and I were 2 for 2 on some pretty terrible interactions with service staff at two places we hit up. We were hungry so we decided to go to Sonora Hot Dogs. They have moved from their location on Burnet and now in front of this beautiful house which by the way is a place where people play Magic the Gathering a few times a week. No offense but that s so weird to me. Beautiful house but what a waste of space.   We pulled into the lot and my husband hopped out of the car quickly and asked if there was restroom we could use. Miguel was super friendly and let us in to the house. So now down to business. We walked up to the window and we were ready to order. Miguel had recognized Mark M from yelp and from his visits previous. Miguel is the epitome of hospitality and service. Hubby and I ordered a premium dog and a carne asada burrito. I was so happy that he had topo chico and gave us limes for it too. There s plenty of seating when the Magic the Gathering geeks aren t there. I imagine that when they re in session there s only a few picnic tables that are in front of the trailer. We were enjoying the nice weather and Hubby had walked over to the near by gas station to get some brews. He bought some Tecate and Miguel gave us limes for that too  Shortly our food was coming out piping hot. I didn t get a chance to taste the hot dog because hubby demolished it but he enjoyed it very much. Come on a bacon wrapped hot dog that s constructed in such a way that makes every bite perfect and even with all the toppings. My carne asada burrito was THA BOMB  Little beef morsels so tender and perfect with avocado. Every bite so perfect. I wanted to take the carne asada and throw it on top of french fries for carne asada fries but that s a totally different story  Everything is made to order with so much love  care and precision. Gotta appreciate a place that really takes the time and care in what they re doing.   I was so happy to finally come here and meet Miguel. Definitely need to come back and try the hot dog since it disappeared before more eyes. Come see Miguel  chat him up  taste his food and give him some Yelp love 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,349,This place was found by complete serendipity. I came specifically for another unnamed island food truck as I noticed their ratings. I arrived early to beat the lines. 10 minutes after the stated opening time  the proprietor arrived and said it would be awhile. New opening time 90 minutes later posted. I digress. I ve never had a Sonora style hot dog  I was already in my lunch hour and decided to try. A bacon wrapped hotdog with assorted other delicious additives in a toasted bun  Hell yes. Bacon and hotdog cooked perfectly and blended well with the toppings. And I thought I was a ketchup hotdog guy. Sonora style hotdogs are now my new go to. Every time. Friendly owners add to an already great experience. One day I will again try for the aforementioned and unnamed island food truck. That day was not today.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,350,Very good hot dog   I got the regular  con todo  .  It comes with a toasted bun  bacon wrapped hot dog  beans tomatoes  onions   pickles  ketchup   mustard and mayo.  Very fresh and good. Price was  5.  Check it out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,351,Everything is awesome  The hot dog is the best everything else is second.owner is truley kind and awesome. Im totally coming back can even byob 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,352,My husband and I come here on the regular...these hotdogs are to die for  We ve introduced them to our friends and they ve become regulars too. Burritos and tacos are also fantastic. Both the veggie dog and veggie taco options are top pics of mine. The chef and mastermind behind T-Locs is actually highly trained in the culinary arts so you can bet this won t be just your average food truck. Seriously  you won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,353,My only regret is that I have worked less than a mile away for 2 years and just had a sonora dog today  Out of this world delicious  I will be going back again and again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,354,Excellent  We loved the bread  the toppings  and the service. Such a great little spot  and we ll definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,355,Amazing hot dogs and an awesome guy making them     The bread is amazing and they offer really good hot dogs   The quesadilla was pretty damn good too. It doesn t hurt that the owner is super cool and down to earth. I hope these guys to far   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,356,Always good when I need my fix.  Owner is a cool dude and the hot dogs always hit the spot.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,357,had the carne asada burrito which I noticed everyone is raving about.  flavors good  tortilla and guacamole excellent.  Meat was nearly inedible.  few things will detract more from a meal than having to spit out large  tough gristly pieces after almost every bite.  knew I should have just stuck with a hot dog.  oh  and I m really beginning to fervently dislike these credit card swiping machines which pressure you into tipping someone for handing you one small 9 dollar burrito and a napkin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,358,At first I was skeptical about a blazing five-star review for this tiny little food truck  but I decided to give it a try and from the very first sip of their agua fresca  I was already blown away. I had a pineapple one and it was amazing - just sweet enough and bursting with fresh pineapple flavor. The attention to detail makes this place special. Think I will be a regular for the foreseeable future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,359,Miguel is awesome. These are the best hot dogs in Austin. If you like hot dogs  look no further. I used to work for Oscar Meyer and Nathan s  trust me I know my hot dogs. I was a taste tester for hot dogs for 19 years. If you want a hot dog that will make you cream your pants and scream daddy  this is where it ends.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,360,Best hot dog ever   I m not kidding. I have had a lot of hotdogs through the years and this one is exceptional. The bun is perfectly cooked and it is a great design. It is uncut on both ends to keep all of the goodness in. They say they have a great burrito which I will try on the next visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,361,I love this place  The staff is so nice and friendly  One of them even gifted me a water bottle trying to cure the spicy green pepper  Great food. Great people. Great atmosphere.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,362,Such a delicious mouth watering beautiful brown grilled bun served with everything you need. Devoured mine in less than 2 minutes. I got everything but the mustard and jalape o sauce. I ve got to say Im impressed. Being that I am from Dallas  always searching for the best hot dog can often leave me disappointed. This time I was not. This is a great spot anytime. Service was amazing  everything was so neat. The playground was definitely a plus. My daughter was able to play on her own at a safe distance and we were able to enjoy our masterpiece.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,363,Just like home   We were so happy to discover this place after missing food from Tucson   Everything was amazing  520 style   Not to mention the owners were so welcoming and accommodating to celebrating my birthday with them.  We will be back time and time again 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,364,The carne asada was utterly delightful  it was like a major flavor fiesta was happening in my mouth. Miguel was very friendly and attentive. This is hands down  my favorite food truck in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,365,This place is AMAZING  I had left my purse there and drove all the way home before I realized it. At least an hour.  I returned and they had my purse with everything inside. I tried to tip them and they refused.  The service is amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,366,Great Frank s with all the fixings. Great upbeat attitude matching the flavorful goodies  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,367,This is legit the best hotdog I have ever eaten  remember to upgrade to the premium meat  haven t had the other one  but the Sonoran hotdogs are one of my top four favorite foods in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,368,So delicious   Tried the hot dogs at Trucklandia today  they immediately accommodated our gluten-free dietary needs and served us a  taco  dog. Best customer service at Trucklandia  and one of the most authentic Mexican food experiences I ve had in Austin so far. Completely recommend.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,369,The hotdogs were out of this world    The bread was amazing  they use really fresh vegetables  I totally recommend this place  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,370,The carne asada burrito is just as legit as the dogs...you can t go wrong with either choice.  Heavily suggest the Premium dog.  They re tucked away from street view  so look for the signs and banners.  Definitely going to swing by here for breakfast to see if it s as good as the carne asada burrito 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,371,This hot dog definitely hit the spot. Friendly staff  nice shaded seating.  I had the regular sonoran hot dog. Next time  I ll try the premium.  Also looking forward to trying the carne asasda.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,372,Can t believe I waited so long to try these guys. Not just because the owner is from Tucson  I m a Wildcat myself   but because it was THAT good. I had the Carne Asada Burrito  and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. The steak was tender and it s one of the best tortillas I ve had in Austin. The two salsas were really good  too.  The red salsa reminded me of the chile we use to make tamales  so it was like eating at home. If you ve seen them and are on the fence about stopping  just go   You won t be disappointed.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,373,Normally  I go there for the excellent bacon wrapped hot dogs known as Sonora Hot Dogs. Today I branched out and got the carne asada burrito. BEST DECISION of the day and maybe month. Following the sage advice of pouring a bit of salsa and a squirt of lime on each bite alternating the salsas  I had one of the best meals of the month. Quick friendly service and great food are worth every penny. The short wait for such great food prompted me to write my first review of this place after nearly 3 years of going to the various locations this trailer has been parked.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,374,The perfect hot dog  If you re familiar with Sonoran style hot dogs you ll know this place knows what they re doing. The grilled pepper on the side adds to the awesome flavor of the hot dog. Will be back a millon times 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,375,Still have yet to try their hot dogs but the carne asada burrito I got was simply amazing. It reminded me of the burritos back home in Cali  well seasoned carne asada  pico de gallo  and mashed avocado packed into a fresh delicious tortilla. The red hot sauce it came with was spicy and complimented the whole thing perfectly. Not a fan of green sauce in general but it was still pretty good. The guy working the window was very friendly and the food came out lightning quick considering it was all cooked to order. I ll definitely be back to try their famous Sonoran hot dogs.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,376,Best food truck in Austin. Hands down. Hot dogs are out of this world. Owners are super duper chill and the story is just so awesome. Cant recommend enough.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,377,Super friendly service and awesome hotdog  Coworker  got the carne asada burrito and said it was also on point. Bonus the seating area is clean and relaxing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,378,By far the most delicious hot dog in town. The burritos are amazing. Breakfast is amazing. Ugh it s so good
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,379,A little bit of Tucson in the middle of Tex-Mex country. It was what I always grew up calling  Mexican food. 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,380,I rarely give 5 star ratings but this place was SO AMAZING   These guys nail a hot dog.  I m a bit of a hot dog conniseur with high expectations and these guys delivered.  Lets start with the bun...the most critical component to a great hot dog.  These guys fly them in fresh every day from a bakery in Tucscon that specializes in hot dog buns.  The toppings were fresh and the mayo was money.  And lets not forget about the dog great bold flavor and texture.    If you are from California or the west you are well acustomed to the disapointment that is Texican Mexican food.  FEAR NOT   This is legit mexican flavor and taste.  I lived in Mexico for a while and got addicted to their hot dogs and these guys replicate it perfectly.    The owner is awesome and is a true craftsman in his execution.  I LOVE the small menu.  They keep it simple and deliver awesome food every time   To the clown who posted a 1 star review on this place...give a real review.  If you are complaining about a  6 lunch you need to start cooking at home for yourself.    I m hoping they will open a downtown location so I can get my fix more often.  Can t wait to try the burrito as well.  Can only imagine how good that will be.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,381,This place is amazing  I m from Arizona and ever since moving to Austin I ve missed Sonoran style Mexican food - Tex Mex just doesn t compare  This is exactly what I was missing  The food is phenomenal - the Sonoran dog they re famous for is a MUST  Additionally the carne asada tacos are fantastic. Great service  friendly people  AMAZING food    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,382,This place has one of the best quesadillas ever  the owner was very attentive and very quick attending customers. My husband and I came here on a quick trip  but definitely coming back to this food truck.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,383,If you know anything about food trucks in Austin then you know that most of them are amazing. This place is one of those places. This was by far the best hot dog I have ever eaten. The burrito was amazing as well. The price was a little high if you think of it as just an ordinary hot dog but well worth it once you start to eat. This is no ordinary hot dog. The staff was also amazingly helpful. It is a little hard to find unless you are looking for it but once you find the place you will defiantly be coming back for another bite.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,384,It was very different  The man was very nice and informative about the food  All super fresh and soo good   Definitely would come back again and recommend
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,385,Best hot dog ever. No seriously. I m not joking. You have to go all the way and get your Sonoran dog Con Todo. It s delish. I m a plain dog  amp  bun kinda gal  because I love the taste of a hot dog. I wasn t sure I d enjoy it Con Todo  but it s the only way to go. Toppings are just the right amount. Oh and the bunsyou could eat those just by themselves too. Owners are super friendly. Good food  good service  good ambience.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,386,I just tried the Sonora Dog yesterday and it was amazing. Interesting mix with the beans  bacon  hot dog  and jalapen  sauce. I can t wait to go back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,387,Delicious con todo hotdogs  Went with my girlfriend and brought my dog. Nice seating arrangements. It was clean and convenient  The hotdogs were worth the drive.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,388,T Loc  you blew my mind. I m speechless. This food is SO BOMB guys... we drove all the way from Killeen to try this food  WORTH IT. We are from Tucson  so our expectations were high. And man you went over and beyond  You need a truck in Tucson  you need a truck EVERYWHERE  Thank you for bringing a little bit of our home to Texas  I wish you the best 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,389,I  love this place. Great Hebrew national hot dog with beans celery mustard and tomatoes. Could not bring myself to get the mayo on a hot dog. The speciality drink was great. Watermelon   so good. I got a refill.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,390,One of the best hot dogs I ve ever had  Very friendly people as well  They use these special sweet buns that just tie it all together. Must try 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,391,Great food  never a let down. If you haven t eaten here   you are truly missing out. The hot dogs are the bomb   So good  I think I can enjoy 5 in one setting  I ordered 3 today. My gosh I still have that wonderful taste in my mouth.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,392,Location has moved to 2308 Hancock Drive. Tucson Locals was the bomb  The Sonoran Hot Dogs were terrific. Buns are brought in from Tucson are terrific. The new location is shady and spacious. Look for the blue UoA food truck and take a taste trip to Tucson 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,393,Really tasty hot dog via Arizona  the Sonoran hot dog is the way to go. Bacon wrapped enough said  Well they ve got more than bacon on the hot dog  get it fully loaded for a truly wonderful experienced in hot dog heaven 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,394,DAAAAMMMNNN    That s a good Hot Dog  I ve been craving a mexican hot dog for a long time now and this place NAILED IT  Do yourself a favor and come revel in this savory hot dog amazingness. I got the Sonora Hot Dog- Con Todo. Totally loving this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,395,The first time I came through here  the owner made me a great carne asada burrito with no frills but delicious  4 stars . I made the mistake of ordering the  11 steak fries on Friday night thinking they would be like the burrito . The crinkle cut fries were not crispy enough  the cheese was good but lacking  he 1 4 lb of steak seemed a lot less  coming from a mostly pescatarian eater  and overall it was very BLAND-not what I want from steak fries.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,396,Got the carne asada plate and it was SO good. Could eat here every day 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,397,T-Loc is such a rad dude and makes the meanest hot dogs. I go for the buns. The new location is much better than the old one on burnet. I recommend this truck to my friends often 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,398,This foodtruck is a one-trick pony and it s one trick is very polarizing. Either you ll love a Sonora Hot Dog and it s beans or you ll be meh. I m meh. It s really just not my thing. I might just not be a fan of this style of hot dog. I love plenty of other kinds.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,399,An excellent hot dog   Good service  other options  but this is a great dog....best with Mexican Coke 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,400,Pretty good hot dog  I was in Austin for a day and wanted something new. Glad I tried this food truck. I am ready to go back to Austin to try this place again. The customer service was also very good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,401,The dogs are amazing   I am contemplating another trip back to Austin just to eat here again  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,402,Came here just the other day to try out their sonoran dogs. They tasted exactly like the sonoran hot dogs in Tucson  AZ where I grew up  I think it s great that someone has brought the sonoran dogs to ATX. Miguel is from Tucson and knows what Tucsonians look for in their sonoran dogs  I look forward to coming back to this food truck in the near future. Enjoy   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,403,I like traditional hotdogs.  Steamed buns  chili  yellow mustard  onions.  But if you need a good hotdog this spot it tasty even if a little wacky.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,404,After hearing amazing things about this place  from more than one person  I decided to give this place a try. The food is amazing  and the owners are wonderful people. The carne asada burrito is delicious  but their staple item  the Sonoran hot dog  is where it s at  You ll never look at hot dogs the same way again  and that s a very good thing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,405,Just had an amazing hot dog at Sonora  Super fresh  slightly crispy dog wrapped in bacon with an awesome grilled bun and all the toppings. Owner was nice enough to get me a sample of the pineapple agua fresco and let me just say that I m not sure why anyone would ever drink anything else.   Can t wait for the new location as I m sure it will be a bit more shady and with less drive by traffic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,406,The Sonoran was absolutely delicious   Hit the spot after a day of hiking. They have moved to a nice shady little spot off Hancock.  Super nice and friendly 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,407,T-loc s was my first introduction to the Sonoran  veggie  hotdog when they were located a bit further north by Conscious Cravings  and now that they ve moved to the new Burnet Rd. food trailer park  I m even more excited  The owner and employees are super nice  and always remember us  even when it s been a while. The new location boasts plenty of seating  a play area for kids  and even more food trailer options if you have a diverse group who may not all want some t-loc s  though really  you should be convincing them to try it at least once . Oh  and try the fresh flavored water if they have it  you won t be disappointed 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,408,I must have been to the wrong Sonora...their much touted special hot dog was Not. It was nothing beyond a small frank on a  non heated  regular bun. They added pico and bacon - but that doesn t make it special IMO. Highly AVERAGE 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,409,Honestly  I was hesitant the eat here because as a pescetarian  hot dogs are usually near the top the list of places to skip  but friends encouraged me to check it out. T-Loc s exceeded my expectations  I got the veggie dog with jalape o sauce and it was delicious   They use Smart Dogs for the veggie dog and the bread for the bun was fluffy and toasted to perfection. That little roasted pepper on the side sealed the deal  The hot dog game has officially been raised.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,410,As a self-proclaimed Foodie Snobby food critic  I have to say these hot dogs are the best I ve had.  Hands down.    My husband and I had lunch at T-Loc s Sonora Hot Dogs on Burnet.  Not only are the hot dogs insanely delicious  the owner was as personable as they come.  This truck is beyond worth coming back to.  If I can pull myself away from the hot dogs I ll try the burrito.  It looks amazing also 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,411,These are some of the best hot dogs I ve had  I m not big on hot dogs so that s saying a lot. Great service too. They ran out of the fresh fruit water when I showed up 30 mins before closing  but the owner said that their water is made fresh every morning and they have been running out. I m going back tomorrow just to try their water.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,412,I loves this place. Honestly  best hot dogs I ve ever had. I haven t had a single bad meal here.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,413,This hotdog beats any other hotdog in the world. Chicago  New York bring it. You can t stand against this dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,414,What the hell  There should be a line of people here. Let s go people. Great after work stop in. Home made fresh fruit drink and quick great food. The couple who own run Sonora Hot Dogs is so sweet. Great simple food with a Sonora flair. Come before the place is discovered and the lines get long    I m back for a second time in less than a week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,415,At first I was a little worried about having mayo on my hot dog but decided to try something new. I have to say that this is the best hotdog I ve ever had  Totally worth visiting 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,416,Pure deliciousness. My wife is from Arizona and loves coming here any chance she can and as a New Mexican  I love this place as well.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,417,A great food truck find with the friendliest owner  We had a Sonora hot dog-loved that it was wrapped in bacon and that the bun was so soft  the carne asada burrito with pico and guacamole  the beef quesadilla-their tortillas are so good  and the peach aqua fresca. We loved it all   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,418,Been there a couple times and the dude is total badass  both times he came over and chatted us up for a few minutes. He noticed I was speaking spanish with my fiancee and he busted out in all Spanish so props for that as well. Very attentive and really into his food and cooking you can see he has a passion for it. He also gave our dog Bobby some treats.   The hotdogs were excellent but dat burrito doe  Seriously just writing about it makes me want to go eat there. Good thing he s within walking distance.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,419,After the first time I ate here  I made a yelp account specifically to give Miguel and Zulma five stars.  This place is the best.    I stopped by yesterday for a quick and delicious dinner  and Miguel told me yelp wasn t giving my review much weight or something because I don t review enough places.  So I m writing another one just for Sonora Hot Dogs   My boyfriend and I have stopped by several times  and it s now one of our favorite places.  The owners seem like old friends now   We found out they got a review in the Chronicle  which was of course very positive - yay them   Anyway  in my last post I talked about how great the food is  and how happy I was to find it in Austin after having lived a while in Arizona.  This time  I have to rave about the aguas frescas.  I am a huge horchata fan and that s usually what I get here.  But the boyfriend is a  real  Mexican who loves cucumber.  I m a  fake  Mexican who doesn t - I actually kind of hate cucumbers.  But when Zulma offered a taste of her cucumber agua  I obliged.  To my happy surprise - It was delicious    So refreshing.  She does a great job getting creative with these drinks and I hope she continues to make the cucumber one   It tasted like the most refreshing mint lemonade-ish beverage imaginable.    As I told the owners  the only thing that could improve this place is carne asada fries     Keep up the great work and congrats on the growing business 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,420,To start off with the location is clean  warm and inviting. Plenty of parking in the lot or at the car wash next door. There are 3 large picnic tables for a nice outdoor eating experience. The owners Michael and his wife  offered a warm greeting as I walked up and were very friendly. I ordered my food which was an authentic  Sonora Hot Dog with everything on it. I was even offered a cold horchata while I waited. The horchata was delicious. After a few minutes wait my Sonora Hot Dog was ready and looked amazing. I think I had only a few bites in and had decided that I had to have another one. The combination of the bacon wrapped hot dog with the homemade specialty sauces and fresh chopped veggies on top in the specialty bun all come together in your mouth for a tasty delight. The second one did not disappoint me. It was just as awesome as the first. So if you are in the mood for the best hot dog experience ever stop by and pick up a few of these. I did not try the burrito but I plan on it my next trip to T Locs Sonora Hot Dogs.  I also noticed that they offer 3 types of hot dogs including a vegetarian hot dog for all of you vegetarians and vegans to enjoy. They also serve a variety of beverages including bottled cokes from mexico  horchata and coconut water.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,421,A co-worker of mine tried this place for the first time last week and was nice enough to bring me back an agua fresca. The flavor for that week was watermelon  and it was AMAZING  Im originally from El Paso and have not had any aguas frescas that compare to what I had back home  until I had theirs. It was exactly the way my mom and abuelita made it  a little bit of pulp and just the right amount of sweetness. They added some ribbons of fresh mint which I thought was the perfect compliment to this already refreshing drink. Yesterday  I took my fiance to finally try the food. We shared a burrito de carne asada and a hot dog  con todo.  The burrito was perfect.  Carne asada  guacamole  and pico de gallo wrapped in a thin flour tortilla. In my opinion  great Mexican cuisine follows a simple rule  a few simple but good quality ingredients orchestrated just right together provide the best flavors. The hot dog was also delicious  with just the right amount of toppings. I am not a ketchup lover myself and was overjoyed that the  con todo  hot dog did not include ketchup. The flavor of agua fresca I had was mango-also delicioso. Its great to see that they were using real fruit to make them  and not artificial flavors.  The couple was extremely nice  and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed their food so much. My fiance decided he want to try the quesadilla with carne asada  he eats like a horse and never seems to gain any weight . I had a bite and it was also delicious  crisp tortilla and gooey cheese on the inside. I m so glad this food truck opened up in Austin  and it s right down the street from where I work  And to think  my new found obsession all started from an agua fresca 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,422,Been trying to come for a couple of weeks  finally got a chance today. Got here and the people working were very polite  and even apologized for being closed the previous times we came. Totally worth the wait  these dogs are amazing  Had been wanting one since I saw this style on Man VS Food. Will be coming back more than a few times 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,423,Wow really good hot dogs.  I got the sonoran dog and it was really really good.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,424,Wow that carne asada burrito hit the spot. The Sonoran Style Hot dog had great flavor and I wanted seconds.  What I really needed was stretchy pants and someone to roll me out of there. The owner was really friendly and made it worth going back in the future.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,425,I brought my husband today for his first Sonora hot dog. I had my first a couple of weeks ago  before the trailer moved to it s new location   it s hard to find  but it s basically in the parking lot directly across the street from Sonic on Burnet . These hot dogs are really good  and made fresh by the owner on the spot. It will not disappoint. I will be certainly going back  and maybe next time I ll try something else from the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,426,They forgot my tortilla  my food was cold and it did not taste as good as everyone said
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,427,How do you eat a hot dog anywhere else after having one from here  I love this place and so does my bank account   
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,428,Great hot dog with lots of flavor. I should have gotten two. If you have a vegetarian in your party they can eat at the vegetarian stand next to this stand.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,429,This place is hard to park for when you are in a rush but the hotdogs themselves are worth the hassle. I need to give fellow yelpers a shoutout for their reviews too  this place is the real deal. I got the hotdog con todo and it was simply amazing. The Great Food Truck Race started my interest and yelpers only encouraged it more. Try it out  the staff is superfriendly too  make you feel welcome.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,430,I had the Con Todo the  regular  way and I must say it was awesome    I ve never had a hot dog prepared this way but it was really tasty.   I will check these guys out again and try some more things on the menu.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,431,Good place  Owners are friendly and love what they do. I had the Sonora Hot Dog which was great. Then had a carne asada was better then most but this is hard to find in the ATX. So with that they come pretty close. The tamarindo agua fresca was just perfect  Service a 5  Hot dog a 4  burrito a 3  water a 4 so overall a 4.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,432,I ordered the Sonoran hot dog and also a burrito which I split with a friend.  The hot dog was good however I think the burrito was better. Owner was very friendly I definately recommend you try this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,433,I discovered what a Sonoran dog is while driving through Tucson two years ago  and have been talking about it since. This place is a great local spot to get your fix. Bacon-wrapped hot dog  beans  tomatoes  grilled jalapeno  a bun flown in from Tucson....  The staff owners are really friendly and the outdoor picnic tables allow you to eat it on site  i.e. get a second if you love the first one like I did.  For those with dinner companions who don t eat meat  the adjacent trailer specializes in healthy veggie options.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,434,Heard about this place online and you tube so  thought we would try it. Delicious   The hot dog was really tasty and the carne asada burrito was the deal. It all the right taste buds   Chef owner was incredibly sweet  friendly  and welcoming. Definitely would recommend this place and we will be back. It s a lil piece of Arizona in Atx  
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,435,Born and raised in Austin and this is by far one of the best hotdogs I ve ever had here. Seriously. I didn t know a hotdog could be that good.   The atmosphere is awesome and laid back and Miguel treats you like family  I had their signature T-LOC Con Todo... Alright  I had two  but they re really that good... especially when you pair it with a Mandarin Jarritos and a bag of Fritos.   I d recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious meal if they re short on time. Or kickback and enjoy the picnic table setup. Either way  you won t be disappointed. I m glad these guys came to Austin  because they sure represent Tucson well   -  K 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,436,Best hot dogs in town with the best customer service  I always recommend this food truck to anyone who visits.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,437,this place is excellent.  run by friendly  competent people who have passion for what they do.  the sonoran dog con todo is sublime.  crispy yet juicy hot dog wrapped in bacon.   warm grilled bun roll.   every ingredient is perfectly conceived and place.   go here.  you will be addicted.   i love this food.   i won t eat a hot dog elsewhere.  best hot dog in austin.   thanks for bringing this to austin 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,438,WOW       Never had a hot dog quite like this- freaking awesome     Mayo on a hotdog  Wrapped in bacon  Yes please
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,439,Got the Sonora hot dog. It was so juicy and the buns tasted like donuts without the sweetness. The bun pretty much tasted like fried dough. And the guy was really nice  which is always a plus.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,440,I d say get the carne asada burrito or get the hotdogs wrapped with the bacon. The taste and flavor is so good. The tortillas are delicious and the buns are like a fluffy sleeping bag.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,441,This is now our favorite food truck in Austin. How do you choose between a hot dog or a burrito  You don t  you get one of each. My hot girlfriend and I each took a bite  looked at each other and said  yep.  Food is great  atmosphere is great  and the owner is great. We will come back often.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,442,Oh T-Loc s  where have you been my whole life  This ladies and gentlemen is their  con todo.  A bacon wrapped dog on a bed of beans  topped with sweet tomatoes and onions. With creamy mayo  mustard and  a jalape o sauce to boot. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink. They get their bread from their hometown of Albuquerque  I believe  can t recall if that s right  which adds a bit of sweetness. All balanced by a salted charred chile for a little heat. This is what a food truck is about  a small menu that they do right. Check it out  Food-gasm rant over.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,443,Easily the best hot dog I ve ever had. Hebrew National  Con Todos . From the bun to dog itself  unique and delicious.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,444,New location....yelp address is wrong. Great space with Picnic benches. Had the Sonora dog which was great- best hot dog I ve had in a while  Good casual lunch or snack spot...
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,445,OMG the best veggie hot dogs around. The bun is mouth-watering good. The only problem was I ate it too quickly and wanted another. Forget the calories and enjoy. Yum 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,446,My wife being from Tucson  these hotdogs taste just like the ones from Guero Canelo.  Had to buy several for my pregnant wife 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,447,Dang good dog.  Got it loaded and glad I did.  Fantastic flavors mingling together in hot dog heaven.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,448,Pretty tasty hot dog  Just wish they had a little more variety with the different hot dogs. Otherwise great and the staff was cool too  High five 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,449,Let me start by saying I m not much of a hot dog fan  but drive by here all the time so decided to give it a try. So glad I did  Hubs  amp  I both had a con todo  amp  split a cheese quesadilla. This was plenty of food  amp  we are not dainty eaters  The dog was great  amp  I loved the grilled pepper on the side. Plus our dogs got treats which is a nice touch. Owner was super friendly. We ll be back fo sho 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,450,You d be a fool not to try this place   I got two of the bacon wrapped dogs  and they were crazy good   Also  tried some fresh pineapple water that they had that was great  too.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,451,The Sonora hot dog is an Austin must try. So delicious. Best hot dog I ve ever had in terms of bread  weenie  and toppings. Their carne asada tacos are excellent too. Great prices. Main dude in charge is very nice and makes you feel like family. Excellent area too with lots of choices. Your new go to for indecisive groups wanting a taste of Austin cuisine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,452,Ok... just had to have my Hot Dawgg Fix... so I stopped by this littke  itty-bitty food truck  Sonora   Sonora style Street fare hot Dogs  the way the make em in Arizona   so I was educated by the Owner Mike  whom by the way was an Awesome cool guy along with his lady and partner Ms Zuma ... I am putting in adoption papers right now  because this 60 yr old Mama is gonna adopt  Best dogone dawgg I have had yet here in Austin  I swear I had Menage et toi Sex  with me  my mouth and hot dogs ...   NOT only was it devine Sex  it was  Orgazamic Sex  July flavorful and had so many yummy goodies that made me feel I was having a meal not a snack...i gulped down TWO....  KEEP it UP KIDS  LOVE... MOM 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,453,Staff is incredibly polite     The food is even better. Not a long wait     Loved it    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,454,The best Sonoran Dog I have ever had and I live in Tucson   My son moved to Austin earlier this year and we decided to stop by while visiting him for some home cooking.  We were not disappointed.  They were a bit pricy but worth every penny.  Next time I will have to try the burrito.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,455,Yes  the carne asada burrito really is THAT good  and the people who run the trailer are delightful. I ll be back  but don t know if I ll ever try the hot dogs  because the carne asada is divine.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,456,If you ve never had a flat Arizona tortilla  you ve got to try this place out   Back story  My wife s family is from Tucson  AZ  and we have visited a few times. The Mexican food there is pretty amazing  although pretty different from Tex-Mex  which I love . The flour tortillas in Tucson tend to be big thin ones instead of the fluffy ones we see most often in Texas. This is the only place in town I ve seen use the Tucson style tortillas  and it s nice to get my fix.  Also  I like to judge my Mexican food joints based on bean and cheese tacos burritos. If you can t get your beans right  you re not the place for me.   So  going back to the review  I got the bean and cheese burrito with my Tucson style tortilla and it was delicious  The beans tasted great and had a nice consistency  the cheese was real cheese and not american style nacho cheese  and the tortilla was perfect. Very very good burrito. The only downside was the price - a bit steep for a simple burrito. But  I will be back. Looks like I need to try the hot dog next.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,457,I don t know if I went on an off day or not  but I found the Premium Sonoran con todo  to be a bit bland.  I was really looking forward to trying this famed dog.  It was just ok.  Too much mayonnaise  beans were bland and even the jalapeno sauce was bland.  The bacon and dog really didn t have too much sabor either.  The bun was soft  but in a way threw the whole dog totally over to the bland side. They were super busy when I was there  and forgot the grilled pepper as well. Were my taste buds just off   I don t know  but I m willing to give them another try some day.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,458,I love this place  His food is spot on to what you would come to expect from Sonoran style Mexican food  The burrito is perfect and the Sonoran dogs are amazing  I even love the charred chile     This should remind you of home  Tucsonans.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,459,I have been wanting to try one of these sonora dogs for a few years now.  When I passed by this place I got really excited and stopped by.  Pretty happy I did.  This dog  with everything  is pretty amazing.  I only really have a craving for a hot dog once in a while  but I would have one of these a week.  Very Good 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,460,I had to try this hot dog truck with 5 stars.  I m not really a hot dog fan  but... these are worth going out of your way for   Order at least two  you will want another.  As a bonus  T-Loc is a really nice guy.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,461,Great food and great service. It holds up to the food cart standard of being slightly overpriced and having servings slightly under sized. Though the buns are better  this place is outdone by Its competitor El Salchichon  off of Pleasant Valley. Granted  El Salchichon isn t perfect either - with its less than desirable location and its raging compressor noise but the bottom line is this puppy gives the nod to El Salchichon for bringing the heat and laying on the cheese. Don t get me wrong  if you are in the area give it a try 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,462,Yum yum yum     They know how to serve up a hot dog    And the service is fantastic. Really nice folks from Tucson. Try their homemade agua frescas.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,463,This was my first experience with this style of hot dog and I ll definitely be coming back. I m not completely sure what was on the dog I ate but it was quite tasty. The guy also gave me a free agua fresca because it was so hot and I had mustache sweat  I assume . Thanks guy 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,464,Today  we finally broke free of cold grey weather that had blanketed Austin it seemed like for weeks. I m sure its only been a few day s but that s how Austin winter weather wimps feel  This day had glorious  Texas blue sky s and sun. Today would be my day to sit outside and reward myself with a Sonoran Hot dog  My only fear - would this dog live up to the hype in my head  As I had not read any yelp reviews.  Not only did it exceed my hype but it seems also the other 101 5 stars reviews here on yelp. Miguel Kaiser was a delighful and personable as could be. Order the dog all the way  trust the chef as each tasty element builds a mouth bomb of deliciousness. The grilled pepper along side the dog with a wash down of tamarind soda was a bingo. Stay Hungry My friend s and get on over here quick.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,465,The Sonoran Hot Dog  con todo  is the best dog in town   The owners are from Arizona and bring this style from the state if Sonora.   Super friendly service   Always good    I can t go back to a plain hotdog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,466,So yummy  I went to U of A and these are just as amazing as the originals in Tucson  maybe better. The bread is FedEx d in and unlike any other boring hot dog bun. The sauces are delicious and the whole dog tastes so fresh with all the toppings  Will be a 1x a week visit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,467,I had never experienced a Sonora Hot Dog until last night... Simply amazing  I was blown away by how delicious it was. Only advice I d give for first timers... Get two  They were so good my boyfriend and I had both wished we d ordered another 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,468,The food here is tasty   My  Con Todo  hot dog was fresh  had plenty of flavor and didn t make me feel heavy afterwards. The couple running the food truck was very kind and enjoyable. I look forward to dragging my husband there soon    
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,469,I don t even like hot dogs but they have a veggie dog that s amazing. The picture on the truck is exactly what the real thing looks like. The dog comes with layers of toppings and a grilled pepper that has just a little heat. The bun ingeniously prevents any drips and it s delicious too. There are also a bunch of other food trucks nearby  Gourdoughs is one   in a nice space where you ll want to sit.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,470,The Sonora dog is excellent and reminiscent of the Guadalajara hot dog at Pink s in LA.  The owner  Miguel  is welcoming and knows his cuisine.  He s Cordon Bleu trained  and knows how to treat a customer.  Miguel has worked at the top of the culinary world  think Thomas Keller  yes that Thomas Keller  and has built a reputation for knowing how to put together an outstanding meal and his disciplined approach to meal preparation presentation.  I ended up ordering a second hot dog  because it was just that good.  Somehow  the crispy tomato and onions offset the bacon just right to make the Sonora a refreshing treat.  I m definitely coming here again.   I can t visit Miguel s food truck without ordering at least two Sonora dogs.  It s definitely among my local favorites in Austin.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,471,Uh.. As someone who had a true sonoran-style dog in Mexico.... For me  I think it s just an overrated hot dog place.. I was expecting their dog to be much bigger... but it is not. It s just too small for 5-6 bucks. However  the dog was not bad  that s why I had to give at least 3 stars. I hate to say this  but I d rather get 7 eleven s...which is much cheaper.. only  2  and you have a variety of topping selections.. japape os..onions whatever you want .
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,472,Austin-ites YOU guys don t know what a gem you have in your own back yard    Family and I were visiting Austin and just noticed this place as we were exiting HEB across the street on Burnet Road.   The menu is short and simple but the food is GREAT    If you want a LIGHT meal then go for a Sonora Hot Dog  wife and grandma got one and loved it  and an agua fresca   Limeade and Horchata on this visit.   If you never had a sonora hot dog  please try its original format before you start taking away or adding toppings.  If you want to go away on a full satisfied tummy  then go for the burrito  It is perfect   Owner very nice and friendly and keeps a clean truck  Speaks English and Spanish. Takes cash and some credit card.   I know there is an army of food truck services out there in Austin and this one may not be listed on Austin s top ten list of food trucks  but hopefully it will make your list    Update June 13  2014  We were heading back home out of Austin and the wife had all the food options that we had already experienced  chain  mom n  pop  amp  other food trucks  but she decided on Sonora Hot Dogs   Plenty of shade to sit down and enjoy a great meal  Friendly  friendly owners   Granted I came back the next day  but was greeted as if it had been year 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,473,You think a hot dog is something just for Sunday afternoon  Don t be fooled. These are actually professionally trained chefs weaving together a sensory blend of never-forget flavors from a mass of ingredients. Great personality too.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,474,I can t stay away from this place   If you ve ever lived in SoCal and miss your carne asada burritos  this is the joint   The tortillas are exactly what you d expect from SoCal  too   They even wrap it in the traditional yellow paper   Go now 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,475,I m a Chicana from San Diego  CA  a.k.a. home of amazing carne asada burritos . Californians know a good place based on the quality of their carne asada  and this place definitely passes the test  I have lived in Austin for almost two years now  and T-Loc s is the first establishment that immediately delivered the taste of home. I highly recommend this place and I am excited to try the rest of the menu 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,476,Best hot dogs ever  great agua fresca  and even better service   What more could you ask for   This place is awesome and their new location has a cute and shady outdoor seating area.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,477,I got the Sonora dog  regular  con todo .  That dog was so good and juicy  the bread was nice and fresh  and the beans and bacon and garnishes made this the best hot dog I ve had in Austin by far   We also tried the carne asada burrito  and all I can say is it was sick...in the best way.  The meat was juicy and well-seasoned with a good tortillas  and that s all it had.  It was simple and delicious because that was all a truly good burrito needs when the product is excellent quality. Sprinkle some salsa and lime on the side and you re good to go.  The agua fresca of strawberry was nice and refreshing and not syrupy.  Plus I got a free refill.  Also  the chef was really friendly and you can tell he takes pride in making his food taste great.  Definitely try to this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,478,Fist time to visit today and will not be my last.   The hotdog looks like a work of art and taste just as fancy.   The perfect amount of spice and sauce in between a fresh bun.   The service was friendly and fast.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,479,By far the best hotdogs of Austin. They are delicious.  They even bring the bread from Arizona to keep the taste authentic.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,480,This place is hands down one of the best food trailers around. This husband wife duo are passionate  clean  and consistently on point. This is amazing food  everyone should have this unbelievable hot dog.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,481,Hot dogs on another level. This simple food truck is a welcomed addition to the diverse food scene off Burnet Rd. The service was fast and friendly and the veggie dog easily filled the hot-dog shaped hole in my heart. Vegetarian or not  you have got to try the veggie dog w  all the fixings fixing to fixins. Also  grab a refreshing Topo to wash it down.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,482,The owner is incredibly friendly  the food is super tasty  everything is as good as it gets. I love this place and I ll be back asap.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,483,I had my first Sonoran hot dog in Tucson  AZ and thought that I would never be able to have one unless I went back. When I first arrived in Austin  I was starving and immediately looked up the best food joints in the city. Sonora Hot Dogs came up first and I felt elated that I could fix my craving. The food truck is set up in cute location with a small parking lot  a few spaces   a tree covered eating area with picnic tables and umbrellas. The owner was incredibly nice and fun to interact with. The Sonoran hot dogs were perfect - just like Tucson. All of the flavors from the bread to the sauce were delightful. If you have never had one  I seriously recommend you take the opportunity because these hot dogs and the service are amazing.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,484,I thought I died and went to heaven    Ate there twice on our 3 day visit to Austin. Burritos are amazing and the service is friendly and quick
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,485,Ok  I used to live in Sanora. One day at work I had a craving.  Need I say more   This place nailed it. Great  bun   great taste. Felt like I was back at the hot dog cart roadside in Nogales.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,486,I just happened by this food truck and was glad I did.  I went with the veggie option which can be hit or miss.  This was my first visit and it seemed like it took a long time to  which it does in comparison to a pedestrian street dog .  This is by no means a complaint as it was well worth the wait.  What you are given is an unusually flavorful treat with many flavors.  It was delicious and I will definitely be back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,487,I can t wait to go back   My husband and I split the con todo and Carne Asada Burrito. Both were excellent. I don t eat hot dogs all too often but this was off the charts. I could eat here every day of the week.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,488,We stopped in here because it was close by in burnet.  We were definitely surprised by how good this was.  Very fresh ingredients  and great tasting hot dog.  The owner was great to talk to.  Recommend you try this place.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,489,The best Hot dog ever. Try it one of my favorite places to go and eat. The sonora hot dog is one of a kind.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,490,Had heard lots of good things about this place and finally had a chance to try it today. I was not disappointed. Tried the premium Sonora Dog and it was delicious. As kind of an after thought I also tried the Carne Asada Burrito. Man  It was so good I almost ordered another. The picnic tables shaded by large trees made for a perfect outdoor setting - even in 90 degree weather. The staff were super friendly too. Made for a great all around experience. Definitely check this place out - and I m gonna keep my fingers crossed that they open up another location down south a little closer to my work.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,491,Wow  I m so impressed by this food truck  I had the Sonora style hotdog. The buns are shipped from Arizona. If you haven t eaten here  you re missing out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,492,Recently spent a month and a half in Austin  and this was one of my favorites. I was actually surprised with how delicious the hot dog was. It seems like a weird combination of items and condiments  but they all go together so well. The owners were extremely nice  gave us a bit of a background on the joint and the food they were cooking up. He told us they bring the buns in from Arizona since it s a specific kind you apparently can t get in Texas. Definitely worth it. If there was a food truck serving this up in Chicago  I d be there all the time.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,493,Cheap  filling  and delicious. Perfect 3 3 for late night eating and in a prime location on Burnet. Great service as well too. The cook was very nice and even offered to bring my order to my car while I waited. Never had one of these dogs till today and i can honestly say i ll be back soon for another. Really interesting combination of flavors and would totally recommend this place to others.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,494,There are very few things good about Tucson  but one is the Sonora Hot Dog. We ve been in Austin a few years now from Phoenix and thankfully we d discovered T-Loc s.  Man is this a great hot dog   In fact it s so good I ll forgive the University of Arizona stickers on their trailer  Go Devils  . My lunch companion had a burrito too and said it was outstanding.  T-Loc  you put out a great dog...I ll be back...more than once 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,495,was passing thru texas heard about t-locs . got the asada quesadilla kinda bland also found what looked like a hair. wont be going back.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,496,Had great expectations based on the positive reviews.   Sitting at a picnic table in the middle of a huge slab of concrete  SHD is right next to a car wash  just 10 yards from Burnet Rd isn t the greatest atmosphere esp if it s hot outside.  Not to mention this is right across the street from the HEB at Burnet  amp  Koenig so the traffic is heavy almost all the time.  But I didn t hit SHD to relax under a shade tree.  I came for the dog dawg.  SHD delivers a good quality dog on a good quality bun with good quality ingredients.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  All served with a postive attitude.  I was expecting to have my socks knocked off based on all the buzz.  The ingredients on the dog were creative but not anything you couldn t accomplish in the privacy of your own home for a lot less.  Wait time seemed kind of long too considering only one couple was in front of me  amp  I was ordering 2 dogs to go for us.  If I was the kind of guy to pay top dollar for car washes  amp  I was hanging out waiting for my car to get cleaned at this particular car wash  amp  I was craving a gut bomb SHD would be on my radar.  Since I m not that kind of guy  amp  don t go that way I wouldn t go out of my way for another SHD.  In other words if I was dropping  10- 15 bux on a car wash  amp  was stuck here I d be cool with dropping  5- 6 bux for a hot dog.  If that sounds like your bag then you will love this place.  Did I mention everyone working here at SHD was really friendly 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,497,Unbelievably good  and addictive   These hot dogs are absolutely delicious  and I could tell that they are made with top quality ingredients. If you like hot dogs  or even if you don t  get one of these 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,498,I ordered two premium hot dogs without bacon and an agua fresca de pina pineapple water . I paid about  15. That is the most I ve paid at a food truck. The food was decent and I would come back sooner if the hot dogs costed a little less.
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,499,I m not a hot dog guy BUT these are amazing.  Other menu items are equally as amazeballs.  The owner is extremely cool and Wednesday nights are the best since the D amp D place is closed.  Check this place out 
T-Loc's Sonora Hot Dogs,500,After leaving U of A and moving to Austin  I ve been homesick for a good Sonoran dog. After a few lousy imitations I had low expectations here. T-Locs blew me away    the bread is right    Those of you from Tucson know what I mean  it was a classic sonoran  everything I ve missed since leaving tucson. Great find  An extra star for the A on the trailer - and theres an Amys right across the street for dessert
