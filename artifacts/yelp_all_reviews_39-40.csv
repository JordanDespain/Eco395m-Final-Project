El Tacorrido,1,Great food and awesome staff.  Will definitely be back.  We had several different tacos and they all where delicious.  Can t wait to go back  
El Tacorrido,2,Came tonight because it states they close at 2am I get to the window  amp  I see the entire staff no one ever comes to the window.  Drove 20 min for nothing.
El Tacorrido,3,I had the revuelta taco and it was amazing  My mom loved her polo and carnitas taco. I will definitely come back for more.   Only complaint is that the offerings in store do not align with the website. Was hoping to try their queso and fish taco as well but will have to see which other tocorrido locations serve them
El Tacorrido,4,El Tacorrido is a gem that has quickly become a staple in my life thanks to the value and quality of the food.  It looks unassuming from the outside  located in the middle of a parking lot of a strip mall off of Lamar and Rundberg. But what it lacks in showmanship it makes up for in taste  price  and consistency.  With most tacos holding steady at less than  3 per taco  as long as you don t go overboard with extra toppings  and the ability to have either breakfast or non-breakfast tacos at any time of day  it s easy to bring a friend and have a full meal with drinks for less than  20 between two people.  These kinds of high-value places in Austin are few and far between. Not only is the price great  but the quality of tacos is stellar. I ve sampled several tacos from their savory menu including the bistec and pollo  as well as some breakfast taco varieties. All have been smash hits. It s hard to stop at just a few tacos because they re so mouth-wateringly delicious.  Don t shy away from the cilantro and onion add-ons unless you re good with missing out on taste.  The salsas come in 3 varieties--2 red and one green. The green is my personal favorite  but you should try them all and find out which suits your palette best.  One pro tip is that if you want avocado on your tacos  you do have to ask for it and pay about  0.50 extra.  There will probably be a guy walking around asking if you want a churro. The churros are solid but unfortunately  depending on the time of day you re there  they might not be warm. Still a nice and sweet tasty treat. I do not believe this guy walking around with the churro cooler is associated with El Tacorrido. Bring cash if you want to finish your meal with some churros.
El Tacorrido,5,Best Mexican tacos on rundberg. The campechano tacos are to die for. Campechano is steak and chorizo grilled on the flattop with onions  super tender and flavorful. They offer corn and flour tortilla options and also serve breakfast all day. Order by the pound to feed a family or individual tacos so you can try out all the meats. Staff is super friendly and they provide quick service.
El Tacorrido,6,The salsa was really good it made the food better. The el pastor was good but the chicharron was not  it was soo soggy not crunchy at all and looked like no meat just rubbery and unchewable skin. GROSS     Way overpriced for the size of the items and low quality    Will not return  
El Tacorrido,7,Perfectly good but not memorable or exceptional compared to other Austin options in really any way. Meat a bit dry
El Tacorrido,8,Good Mexican flavor tacos tortas quesadillas and delicious salsas mmm and good costumer service
El Tacorrido,9,I just moved into the area so I needed to find a new taco spot. I figured Tacorrido would be a good option. Ordered my usual and when I got home I realized there was no salsa in the bag. None. I looked online and saw that they charge for their salsa. If that isn t the most gentrified Wipipo ish ever I don t know what is. So here I am  not only eating dry tacos  but they didn t even add salt or any type of seasoning. Ended up being the blandest tacos I ve ever had. Hard to justify giving them another shot with the small  dry  bland tacos I just ate. If you re going to have this policy in place  you should make it abundantly clear because even the roadside taco trucks get that part right.
El Tacorrido,10,This place is delicious the go to spot for authentic Mexican food.  It s a small little house look a like in the corner of the shopping center.  You can tell this place is bomb because the line in the drive through is out the door.  This was our 2nd time and it did not disappoint.  The only reason I didn t give it a 5 star was because customer service is horrible.  Ladies are in a pissed off mood and could care less about what you think.  They do accept credit cards and you get your food pretty fast.  You can walk up or drive through there is a small table but I don t think it s for people to sit and eat.  Food smelled delicious and it tasted so good.
El Tacorrido,11,Somehow forgot the meat and gave us just egg and cheese on all five breakfast tacos we ordered to go. How do you even do that 
El Tacorrido,12,The best beef tacos I ve had in Austin  I swing by after work at least once a week for these delicious and flavorful tacos  The line is a bit long some days but we ll worth it  Have yet to try everything on the menu but will update this review when I do 
El Tacorrido,13,Always pleasantly delicious  Friendly staff. Muchas gracias   The Salsa Verde is the best in the neighborhood.
El Tacorrido,14,This place used to be my favorite al pastor in town and for my birthday this past March we had some friends over and my wife ordered 100 tacos. Nothing was labeled and tacos were crammed into boxes so to grab a taco you inevitably touched someone else s to find out what the hell kind of taco it was  just so dumb. They ve also always been SO tight with their salsas but the last two times we went put us over the edge. We went thru the drive thru and ordered 6 tacos. She asked what kind of salsa we wanted so i prefaced with  Ok 6 tacos  six salsas  so we d like three verde and three molcajete thanks   - Drove up and we were charged for two extra salsas. I asked why and the guy said  it s one for two  I said does that mean if i order one taco you don t get a salsa  He replied no  if you order one taco you get one salsa if you order two tacos you get one salsa. I asked how does that make any sense  What if its six people going their separate ways and want their own salsa  I got a blank stare. I m thinking this is a classic Larry David Curb Your Enthusiasm episode where he drives through the line 6 separate times in circles and orders one taco each time out of principle. On top of that we get home and WE ONLY HAVE 4 SALSAS FOR 6 TACOS OH THE HORROR. But seriously  charged extra and didn t even get what we paid for and the tacos are WAY smaller than they used to be. I wrote them privately and got no response so here is your public review El Tacorrido. You have lost our business over nickles and dimes and I will no longer recommend your fleecing ways. Adios 
El Tacorrido,15,I stopped by this taco joint one day for lunch while I was in Austin. I ordered barbacoa and chicharr n tacos. Both were good but not the best. If I m in the area I might stop by and try something else.
El Tacorrido,16,I would like to start off by saying a friend took me to this place because he highly recommended it. I was extremely disappointed in the quality and taste of the quesadilla and fish taco that I ordered. I returned a second time to see if there was any chance of redemption  this place is very close to my home  but alas I was only let down again. I tried their barbacoa which was chewy  fatty and not even shredded. The corn tortillas seemed to not have been warmed up and fell apart immediately. The quesadilla pictured was covered in grease  the corn tortillas falling apart yet again and the taste was just off. As a Hispanic I am absolutely astounded at this businesses ability to call their food Mexican. Horrible. Disgusting. Not to mention the staff which gave me attitude when I asked for lime-- they insisted was in the taco foil  but was not. You re better going off to Rositas  Taco more  El taquito  and any other GENUINE taco place in the area. Avoid this culturally appropriated nightmare.
El Tacorrido,17,I ve always loved there tacos been going here for 2 yrs. they are always so nice and have the best tacos.
El Tacorrido,18,I don t care if the food is good. Literally not one person inside this establishment was wearing a mask. As a food service worker you have a greater duty to ensure that your close contact with people s food is as safely prepared as possible  Not one person. Like who on earth owns a restaurant in COVID times and thinks it s food for business to not wear a mask  
El Tacorrido,19,this place is legit. no lie. no joke. try the tortas.  you want more words  fine. we were driving around looking for a place and decided to check this little shak out. weve been here every day for the last 4 days. i like the tortas cause i like veggies. the tacos are excellent  but sometimes i just want more than onions and cilantro  ya dig  i will say that the gordita i got was a bit of a greasy mess  but sometimes you want that  i won t judge.  also  try the molcajete salsa.
El Tacorrido,20,Below average tacoa but what will have you questioning this establishment is their ridiculous prices for the worlds smallest tacos.  I lived all over and had pretty small street tacos but not for 3 dollars a pop.  Complete rip off.  Might as well keep driving a block down and go to Torchy s for bigger and better tacos.
El Tacorrido,21,Flight was delayed  landed around midnight. Couldn t find my luggage....learned there was an issue and I need to call to check on my bags tomorrow. There goes my toiletries......whomp whomp.   I was determined to not let this slight bump get in the way of my getaway.... So tacos it is  By this time  it was getting closer to 2 am and there weren t many places open except for El Tacorrido. Their hours are pretty awesome  open until 3am  The menu was pretty short and sweet. We ended up getting a variety of tacos  al pastor  carnitas  bistec  beef fajitas   and carne guisada  beef stewed in onionand tomato .  Oh man.... So delicious  The tacos appear small but they definitely pack a lot of good stuff so it s deceivingly filling  in the best way     I highly recommend checking out this place and getting a variety for yourself  Sharing is optional  - 
El Tacorrido,22,Best true mexican street tacos in Austin. Fight me if you disagree.  And they re open late   ALWAYS ask for the molcahete salsa
El Tacorrido,23,I will never go to this place again  Waited in line for almost an hour the guy taking our order completely ignored us and we couldn t even place our whole order before him moving on to the next vehicle. On top of that he charged me for someone else s order. I tried to explain that he charged me wrong and he would not listen  He was rude and called me a pendejo. The food a mediocre at best  . La comida de mi perro est  m s bueno que esto. Worst experience ever.
El Tacorrido,24,WOW   Love it ... Love it.... Love it       We walked over late last night -they are open until 3 am - and decided to try the Al Pastor meat by the pound to bring home.  Service was really friendly and super fast. Even being as late as it was  there were quite a few people packed into this tiny little shack and even more in the drive through.  This place is set up in a shopping center parking lot on Rundberg and Lamar and is quite busy all day long - understandably so.  The prices are unbeatable and there are many delicious items on the menu.  Our order was ready in about 5 minutes  when you order meat by the pound  which you have your choice of either cuerito  buche  carnitas  al pastor  or revuelta. You are also given your choice of tortillas along with salsa  onion  lime  and cilantro. This makes 10-12 tacos and only costs you  14.00                                We eagerly walked back home and dug in and let me tell you - it was d e l i c i o u s   The al pastor was amazing  the spices were not overpowering and when you take a bite  the flavors literally burst in your mouth.  Even the pineapple came through at the back of your tongue in a refreshing subtle way that was tantalizing.   The corn tortillas were fresh as well as the cilantro  onions  and limes.  The portion for this dish were outrageous.  Worth every single penny and then some.    It was so good that the first thing I did this morning was walk back over there to try a breakfast taco.  I ordered an egg and chorizo taco on a flour tortilla and added avocado on it.  The cost for this  2.25.  It was as expected.. delicious. The eggs were not egg beaters but real eggs  not salty like so many taco places either.  The chorizo was amazing  nicely balanced with spices.    Both times  I requested the Verde De Aguacate salsa.  Yes  its spicy but it has soo much wonderful flavor to it - not all heat like other places.  Very fresh indeed    I tried the Molcajete salsa while waiting for my order last night  and this was pretty dang awesome as well.  I am totally a fan and will be back regularly for sure. If you have not tried this place and like authentic Mexican food  then check this place out.. you will not regret it 
El Tacorrido,25,One of my favorite taco places in Austin  The prices are amazing and also very good  I can t wait to come back for more. I ve been trying to find an authentic taco place and I ve finally discovered this amazing place  This place will now be my go to taco place  Let s just say it HITS   
El Tacorrido,26,My friends and I got into Austin super late so a lot of places were closed but we found this gem right by our hotel  It s literally a little hut sitting in the parking lot in a shopping plaza.  I can tell it s popular because of the late night and drive thru option. I ordered two tacos  One with Al Pastor  pineapple marinted pork  and Carne Gulsada  beef stewed in tomato and onions . I absolutely loved the Al Pastor  The flavor was great and the pork was cooked just right. I didn t like the Carne Gulsada as much. I felt like the flavor was more bland. My other friend got the quesadilla and she said she enjoyed it because it was bursting with flavor.  if I was more brave  I would have loved to try the breakfast tacos because I read from other yelpers that they re good here  I definitely want to try the gordita next time.
El Tacorrido,27,Wish there were great taquerias like this one in round rock so i didn t have to drive so far for authenticity. I always go for the carnitas tacos and they are a hit every time  I love that i don t even have to ask for a corn tortilla because for some reason everywhere else i go they want to serve the taco with a flour tortilla and i have to ask for corn instead. The only problem i have is the quesadilla because of the cheese that they use. It tasted more like a creamy white cheese for chips maybe  I m not sure but overall i love this place and i ll always come back  Plus there is a churro guy that comes around while waiting in the drive thru  5 per bag that are amazing 
El Tacorrido,28,Dishes  Barbacoa Tacos  fajita Tacos  Al Pastor Tacos   Time of wait   10 minutes   Taste  Most authentic tacos I ve ever tried in Austin. Dishes will also come with extras to add in to your tacos  sour cream  cilantro  onions  salsa .  5 Stars   Atmosphere  This place is a small little drive thru shack. There s no dining or seating available. Perfect for after hours munchies.  3.5 Stars
El Tacorrido,29,If you want sassy customer service. And explosive diarrhea. This is the place to come.  Me  con que vienen la torta what does the torta come with  Tacorrido  pan bread
El Tacorrido,30,This place has delicious Mexican food  great customer service and a very nice spot to chill. It s nicely decorated and very affordable.
El Tacorrido,31,Really good tasting tacos with pretty good red and green hot sauces. Was too crazy when white cheese was added to the carne guisada taco. Also  ordered carne guisada and was given picadillo instead. It was still pretty good anyway. Enjoyed the beef fajitas an the pastor tacos. The Barbacoa taco had large chunks of fat  was a little disappointed. The tacos are made with small street flour and corn tortillas. Didn t expect small flour street tortillas. But all the tacos were stuffed anyways. Really liked the chips and salsa. Sorry no pics...
El Tacorrido,32,I have been a long time patron of El Tacorrido. However  today they charged me  5 more than the total. When I asked them about it the guy claimed the bottled Cokes were  3 instead of  2 as the menu read. I called his BS and asked to return the unopened Cokes. He then short changed my refund. They don t give a receipt and are cash only.   They have over charged me by a dollar before and I didn t think much of it. Are they profiling me or tipping themselves  Who knows. But I know...  Never again.
El Tacorrido,33,El Tacorrido is great. At 2 AM it s a godsend. You get food twice as fast as Whataburger  and it s actually edible. This is one of the few spots where I opt for tortas. I usually douse everything with the green sauce  but their molcajete salsa is good too.
El Tacorrido,34,Long wait for breakfast tacos. I repeated my order several times  even in Spanish  but when I got to work  my order was completely wrong. Completely over-priced tacos for their quality and size. I m going back to my regular spot.
El Tacorrido,35,My first time here and I loved it  El pastor tacos and the green salsa were the best. Worth the wait in line.
El Tacorrido,36,Great autenthic  late night  cheap taco spot. Simply drive up to order and pick up in the next window in a few minutes. I had the barbacoa and al pastor here a couple times.. each taco is jam packed with meat.  Just be cautious with the hot sauce. I thought I could handle spicy  but it ll rip open your stomach here if you re not careful with how much you put on 
El Tacorrido,37,All I can say is yummmmmm  The trailer has been around forever and has really good Mexican street tacos and tortas.
El Tacorrido,38,Tacos were super good. Meat was good. Will eat there in Austin again. Make sure you try the red molcajate salsa. It s not as cheap as a tqco truck but was worth the price.
El Tacorrido,39,I love this place.  We found this by accident on our trip to Austin.   It was a little busy when we went and if you re looking for dine in   good luck. They have 3 stools outside and no indoor dining.    However  the food is amazing     I m really hard to please when it comes to tacos al pastor and let me tell you  these tacos did not disappoint    I can t wait to go back 
El Tacorrido,40,I came to Austin for an overnighter to attend a wedding last month. Was told to visit this place and get the El Equinox. Let me tell you  it s worth it to the last drop. Definitely a must-try item when you re in Austin. The food was good as well. FYI  there s no seating  just a drive-thru place. Worth every penny 
El Tacorrido,41,Change your hours if you re not going to be open the hours listed. Okkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
El Tacorrido,42,Got their revuelta taco and their carne asada taco  tried both the corn and flour tortillas. Both tortillas are good. The revuelta was so good and unhealthy -- the pork skin was bomb. The cashier was friendly as well 
El Tacorrido,43,El Tacorrido is the tits  y all.  If anyone gives this place less than four stars because of waiting in line... Bruh  you gotta be kidding. It s not their fault they re popular   Delicious tacos  both breakfast and not  WONDERFUL verde salsa. And if you re hungover  order the equinox  horchatta and espresso over ice. It ll bring you to Jesus.
El Tacorrido,44,my go-to spot  and apparently everyone else s based off the drive through line    - luckily they re relatively fast so i m never waiting long and the food is always worth it     -   also huge plus is they re open late so i will always choose them as my late meal of choice   i love el tacorrido norte    thank y all   
El Tacorrido,45,I came here a long time ago in the early 2000s when I was unfamiliar with tacos and didn t return until recently  May 2015 .  Now with years of taco experience behind me  I consider Tacorrido one of my favorite taco joints around town.  It s up there with Taco More  Taqueria Gardenia  and Matamoros Tacos.    I usually get the breakfast tacos served all day.  You pick three ingredients  tortilla type  cilantro and onions  and salsa.  I ve had the red salsa  the light green salsa  and the slightly darker sea green salsa.  My favorite would be the sea green salsa so far--it seems to be the spiciest and is tangy.  The tacos are overflowing with the three ingredients you picked.  I like how their tacos are not greasy like other places.  Tacos are the cheapest around town at only  1.75.  This location is open until 3 am  though the parking lot and area of town is too sketchy to visit after dark .  The drive-through seems to be just as popular  if not more so  than ordering at the counter.  There isn t much seating indoors since it s just a stand.    My to-go order takes noticeably longer than Taco More  but that s probably just due to the small kitchen they have to work with.  The staff is always friendly and there are English speakers for us gringos.    El Tacorrido is the odd-looking micro-building in the parking lot at the Southwest quadrant of the North Lamar   Rundberg intersection.  It s across from Advance Auto Parts.
El Tacorrido,46,My husband and I came to Austin as tourists but both became sick and couldn t go explore Downtown. We wanted to stay close to our hotel for food and found this taco stand on Apple Maps. SO good. Great value and convenient since it is one of the few stands with a drive through in the area. We ordered the pound of carnitas and it tasted great and very fresh.
El Tacorrido,47,I don t like Mexican food. Living in Texas has warmed me up to quality Mexican. I can t say this is the BEST but oh man  after a few hours of shooting pool  my friends and i like stopping here on our way home and we order 1-2 tacos and it s sooo good. I look for the spicy salsa and pickled onions and squeeze that lime all over my flour tortilla. I ve tried the corn and frankly the flour is tastier. I like them all and it s  2 each. woot 
El Tacorrido,48,I seriously LOVE this place  My boyfriend and I come here several times a month. The bacon  egg  and cheese tacos are excellent  The carne guisada is super yummy  too. But my absolute favorite thing from here is the El Equinox - horchata with espresso  Even if you typically don t like horchata  this stuff is amazing  I don t eat menudo  but my bf orders it every time. He says it s really good  and he s tried a lot of menudo  The place is well priced  the employees are super nice and helpful  and the place is clean  5 Stars from me. Keep being awesome  El Tacorrido.
El Tacorrido,49,I am giving 3 stars because of service. The food is great  reasonably priced. I appreciate the fresh made food but their drive through is so slow.  With their dining room closed they need a way to order online and have a pick-up table to make the process easier.  Even pre-Covid it was slow but now it s way worse. Second  they get our order wrong at least 50  of the time.  Check your order before you leave.
El Tacorrido,50,The best carnitas tacos in town  if u want to try somenthing diferent fo for the Revuelta  cuerito buche  amp  carnitas  my favorit The salsas are awesome too.
El Tacorrido,51,Order the carnitas tacos on corn tortilla with everything on it with a side of molcajete sauce. You ll thank me later. It s two dollars a taco and they are to die for. Really glad my boyfriend and I stumbled across this place. Also  they are open till 3am. Great for late night food runs if you re into that.
El Tacorrido,52,Get the equinox single shot    Horchata and one shot expres  delicious    Definitely my new Favorite drink
El Tacorrido,53,By far the best street tacos that I ve had here in Austin. They offer all tacos at 2  a pop which isn t bad especially for the quality. I highly recommend    The long crazy line explains it all  definitely worth that wait. I will continue to come here .
El Tacorrido,54,Ok so I go there with a friend at an ungodly hour....and like the previous posters stated  its pretty sketchy round those parts..omg...yes...like 6 cop cars pulled up outta nowhere and was hanging in the parking lot.  yet the long drive through line moved NOT an inch. A dude comes round to your window to take your order..limited english  so practice your espanol.  and after tasting one of those delicious pollo flour tacos  I can see why..very flavorful  loaded up with fried bell peppers and onion and fresh chopped onion and cliantro..um um um. The rojo salsa is soooo good and spiced just right.  so yeh  its worth it to venture over there and possibly get caught up in some uncessary drama...but kinda worth it  hahah
El Tacorrido,55,Great tacos  There was a bit of a wait once I got there  but it was to be expected on a busy Friday night. The selection is great for what it is and the tacos were authentic and fresh 
El Tacorrido,56,This was amazing. We got Al Pastor Tacos  and the hot sauce that was paired with it was absolutely amazing. We got the tacos around midnight  and they got our tacos out very fast. They re taco tortillas were really soft  maybe because we got the flour tortilla  but was amazing as well. It is a must try 
El Tacorrido,57,I love their food and I go there when I m in Austin  I live in Dallas .  However  their staff gets my order wrong 80  of the time.  I don t know why they add cheese to my potato and egg tacos when I clearly don t ask for it.  They need to hire competent people who can take orders correctly.  If I didn t like their food I would quit going there.
El Tacorrido,58,This is my absolutely favorite Taco place in Austin. I ve been coming here for years  and the quality has always been on-point. The prices are great and the food is just amazing. Even when the line is long  it s not too bad.   If you re reading this review  please go.
El Tacorrido,59,Authentic mexican tacos  These tacos have so much flavor and they are open late   Prices are great and the Al pastor are always bomb  Food here never disappoints me or the people I have recommended here.   -1 star because of location...not a safe area
El Tacorrido,60,Best tacos I ever had didn t even get the chance to take a picture.. That is how fast it was gone. Best place hands down to get tacos after a night out  Will definitely be back soon with extra details
El Tacorrido,61,The tacos taste just like they should. I ve eaten my weight in street tacos in Mexico  and these are just as good. Yum  I loved the barbacoa. Will have to try others.
El Tacorrido,62,Five stars for the taco al pastor. I ve been looking for an al pastor that is cooked with pineapple  and El Tacorrido delivered. Delish 
El Tacorrido,63,This is my go-to when I want tacos. Great food  amazing prices and good salsas. Top it off with a mandarin jarritos and I m in heaven. Thank you so much for feeding us.
El Tacorrido,64,I love this place  Tacos and quesadillas are great  especially their carnitas. They make their chips in house and they are perfectly crispy. Their Verde sauce is also so yummy...perfectly seasoned and good spice to it. I know this totally random but they also make these chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches and they are THE BOMB  We have made a few late night runs just for their ice cream sandwiches. It s difficult to stand out in Austin for tacos Mexican food  but they really do and that should tell you something.
El Tacorrido,65,Everything was super tasty. The hot sauces were beyond my liking but if you like heat then you ll be fine that why I m going 4 star. All three hot sauce options were too hot. If there was a 4th sauce that was mild to slightly hot I d go 5 stars for sure.
El Tacorrido,66,Omg the best tacos I ve had since moving to Texas. I will be back tommorow before I leave.
El Tacorrido,67,The service at night is the only reason this isn t a 5 star review. The have some of the best prices for tacos in the area. I love the bacon  bean and cheese on flour tortillas. They should sale bottles of the salsa verde.
El Tacorrido,68,I ve heard a lot about this place so i went and I m disappointed    they didn t put bacon on my friends bacon and egg tacos and gave me flour tortillas when I asked for corn. we went around 12 30 AM so it wasn t packed at all. food wasn t that great either   
El Tacorrido,69,Had the al pastor and the bistec.   The bistec was very average and typical  a little on the dry side.  The al pastor was different..... it was cooked with pineapples  kept it very moist and somewhat sweet.   The place didn t impress me at all. About a 2.5 if I could.
El Tacorrido,70,We ve been coming here for breakfast tacos for weeks thanks to a full kitchen remodel leaving us with no way to feed ourselves unless cereal without milk sounds tasty.  Their breakfast tacos are among the best I ve had in Austin.  I m not sure why  either   They look deceptively simple.  Maybe they cook the scrambled eggs in bacon grease   I ll be honest - I don t want to know their secret.  I just want them to keep making delicious tacos.  My personal favorites are the bacon egg and cheese and the carne guisada.  The carne guisada is nothing like what I ve had anywhere else - it s less of a gravy and more of a delicious mix of meat and veggies - which I think makes me love it extra.  My fiance swears by the potato ham and egg  which I found to be a little bland.  But he also won t eat breakfast tacos with bacon in them  so his judgment is a bit suspect.  The wait is sometimes a bit long  so don t expect it to be a true drive-thru experience of service in a minute or less  but it s well worth the wait for consistently delicious breakfast tacos 
El Tacorrido,71,I stumbled across this place while I was looking for a restaurant that had breakfast tacos and a drive through. It isn t the most attractive place or in the best area so I was skeptical but I am beyond amazed by this place. I have never had tacos this amazing and delicious. I got the barbacoa tacos on corn  and bacon  potato  egg  and cheese on flour. Once they were gone and I was full I still wanted more . They also had this amazing salsa that was so spicy and complimented the tacos perfectly. I will absolutely be back. Also  for 4 tacos I paid under  10 which is incredible.
El Tacorrido,72,Best. Tacos. EVER  No joke   I ve had everything from sausage egg to the chicken and beef street tacos. They are all equally amazing 
El Tacorrido,73,Revuelta Torta with salsa verde is now my official go to late night snack.  Carnitas  pork skin  and pork stomach  with avocado  mayo  lettuce  tomato  in a nice bun. Brilliant.
El Tacorrido,74,I had the midnight munchies  and came across this gem on google maps. I m always a little weary of  taco trucks  but I decided to give it a go  and man was I thoroughly impressed. The only negative thing I have to say is there was ALOT of onions  but other than that.... it was AMAZING. Give it a try 
El Tacorrido,75,their green sauce is fire. tacos were okay  super oily. got harassed by a homeless guy.
El Tacorrido,76,The food is great. If you get your order taken by a tall balding guy  though  it is guaranteed to be wrong.
El Tacorrido,77,Words cannot describe what my tastebuds are feeing right now. I ordered 4 beef tacos that were absolutely life changing  I wasn t sure on sauces so I asked for all of them. All of them are delicious. Not only was my order ready fast but it was hot fresh and hands down the best tacos I have ever had. Thank you 
El Tacorrido,78,Some people can t tell the difference between spice and flavor. That s the only conclusion I can draw from the negative reviews I read while waiting to eat at El Taccorido.   I ordered two waters  just ran 4 miles  and three meat tacos on corn  Guisada  Reveulta  and Barbacoa.  8  These aren t spicy tacos. They didn t burn my tongue off.   But the meats in each of these are tender and full of natural slow-cooked flavor.   The soft  corn tortilla held up well and were among the best I ve ever had. I should confess that I rarely get corn.   Just to test myself and El Taccorido  I put some salsa and avocado lime spicy stuff on part of my tacos. My tongue was still in tact  but my lips burned like that Violent Femmes song.   The tacos aren t naturally spicy  but I can make them that way if I want. They are full of flavor and an outstanding dollar-for-delicious value.
El Tacorrido,79,Really amazing taco place...one of the best in town..looks like a really small place but gosh they make the best tacos.
El Tacorrido,80,Great tacos. Get s very busy though so you may have to wait a little bit which isn t too big of a deal. Solid choice though if you re looking for authentic Mexican street food.
El Tacorrido,81,El Tacorrido was a very pleasant surprise.  I usually get Taco Deli down the street  but my girlfriend looked on yelp to try something different. She found that El Tacorrido had really good reviews. So my girlfriend dragged me out there in the late morning. And though I was hardly awake driving there  I was very surprised to see how affordable the prices were and how delicious the food tasted. If you re a fan of spicy salsa  this is the place for you    -david
El Tacorrido,82,Quick service  great portion sizes  and DELICIOUS FOOD    Wish they delivered    Very impressed with the Al Pastore taco and Barbacoa   
El Tacorrido,83,I went thru drive thru around 1 30 am and this is the 5th time that I get my order wrong and the worst is that I called back but they never answer the phone
El Tacorrido,84,Pretty good tacos and cost less than most other places  this is a to go joint so make sure you don t come thinking it s a sit down place. I tried the carnitas  pastor and bistec  all were very good. Their salsas are good and spicy.
El Tacorrido,85,Super delicious. Got some of the best guisado tacos ever. They have huge jars of vinegar-onions that are to die for. Folks working there are super nice. The shopping center is perfect for all the Mexican food favorites - ice cream  licuados  and a well stocked supermarket.
El Tacorrido,86,Yummy. For the price it was amazing and the Salsa is so flavorful.  I opted for both the guisada and breakfast taco. Que Rico 
El Tacorrido,87,I love this place for Mexican food. It s surprisingly hard to find reliably good and affordable Mexican food in Austin  I lived in south Texas for many years . The tacos never disappoint and the tortas are damn good. I visit frequently.
El Tacorrido,88,Quick and good  They even have a drive thru  This place is tiny but t produces big flavor  The barbacoa is off the chain and the tacos are only  2 a piece- can t beat that  They do accept credit cards now too.
El Tacorrido,89,Came here yesterday on a Sunday morning. Carne guisada is amazing  make sure to try that out if you ever come here. They also do a really good job on the breakfast tacos  I ended up getting a couple of those. Very very cheap food  only a couple of dollars per tacos. Food this delicious and filling   very cheap price... leads me to have to hand out a 5 star to these guys. They re fairly far from my house  but I ll definitely be coming back here anyways.
El Tacorrido,90,Cash only. Only barstool sitting area  but there is a drive-through.  I got 3 tacos for   5.25. Delicious  tasty  tender meat. Yummy soft corn tortillas.  Onions   cilantro   salsa are the only three components you need    They have menudo on the weekends I think.  Next time  I ll have to try the breakfast tacos. So am I coming back  duh.
El Tacorrido,91,Inedible  disgusting food that smells like rancid oil and has dry  old meat that tastes like it was the cheapest quality meat they could find. The food is so gross it makes you wonder whether it is actually fried rat or squirrel. The toppings on the tacos were spoiled chopped cilantro and onions that is brown and withered along the edges. I admit I am pretty spoiled as an Austinite and am used to the wonderful taco restaurants that we have in Austin that serve fresh food sourced from local farms so my expectations were high. But this place is pretty unacceptable  and I m glad I threw it away and did not finish eating  because if I had I would be concerned about food poisoning. But the one positive thing about this is that it is cheaply priced so if you want a deal  have a cast iron stomach and don t care about quality or taste  then this place is for you.
El Tacorrido,92,WOW    The meats here are amazing  Very authentic mexican meats. Got a half lb of barbocoa and half lb of Revuelta. Both equally amazing  comes with tortillas and salsas  onion and cilantro. Heard the breakfast tacos are on point  ill be sure to update the review once I try them 
El Tacorrido,93,I live so close by and am always saying   I ve got to try this place   And it happened and all I left saying was  Meh.    The price is right and the food is decent but I feel like the meat was lacking spices or flavor. I dunno there was something serious missing from the meat. I ordered Carnitas and barbacoa tacos  bistec torta  and a bistec gordita...  It was just so... unenthusiastic.
El Tacorrido,94,Ever since Super Burrito got pushed out of our neighborhood  this is my favorite go-to drive through tex mex place. The tacos are so good  and they have breakfast tacos all day long. My vegetarian friends love their mushroom sandwich thing and the veg taco. I m a huge fan of the barbacoa and carnitas. And their horchata with espresso is quite good  if you like espresso.
El Tacorrido,95,And now  a few words from patrons of fine dining establishments   Messrs Jekyll and Hyde.  Dr.Jekyll  My dearest fellows  Tacorrido has various tacos of the delicious kind  and their logo is the cuter than an army of Hello Kitty cosplayers.   Mr. Hyde  Gruhg. Surely...you speak of the Tacorrido on South First street.    Dr. Jekyll  Er  yes. I mean  it s true  the South First street location is newer and better looking  but the food is the same  correct   Street taco fare  savory salsas like their molcajete  and certainly cost effective  although their ingredients are probably far lower on the food chain than say  Tacodeli    Mr. Hyde  Hrraghl. So you say.... I guess I d have to eat at one of them  then Drive Over to.the.other.one. andtrythose ... Ain t no Hyde got time for that. But heHEHEHEEEE the one on North Lamar  by Rundberg  is open until 3 a.m   THREE  A   M   HAH   I love Rundberg. Rundbergy luv. MMmmm. 3 am.... runnnnndberrrrrrgggggg. Heh.  THREE.  Dr. Jekyll  It would be just like you to be in that vicinity at that hour  sir. I feign not what kind of thoughts I think about your character. Tacos  indeed.   Mr. Hyde  MOL CA JE TEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE     muHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAH  LA LA LA LA    Dr. Jekyll runs away 
El Tacorrido,96,Great for my post gym snack  my breakfast  or even just that later in the evening run for snackage that isn t sand meat  IE the bell . These guys are right around the corner from me currently  and while I m moving soon  I plan to make sure i still try to make it here at least once every two weeks.  Cash only...but the food is great. Fresh Veggie  Fresh meat  never greasy  even the chorizo   I go between the pineapple fused pork and some form of the beef typically. The quesadilla you get your choice of beef or chicken...depending on how decadent you re feeling I d go chicken. The beef is great..but it s that oh man i feel like a fatty now feel.  says the man who orders melted cheese in between tortillas 
El Tacorrido,97,Want so more tacos just thinking about this place. Most places don t sell buche so that s how you know it s legit. All the salsas are on point and just what you need to compliment the mouthwatering meat choices.
El Tacorrido,98,Wow  Second time I ve been here for breakfast and it s absolutely delicious. Taste just like my moms cooking and in my opinion it s very hard to come close to. Their green salsa is perfect. The right spiciness and the tangy flavor from the tomatillos knock it out of the park. Will be coming back to try the other tacos. Great job Tacorrido on N Lamar and Rundberg.
El Tacorrido,99,this is my favorite taco place of all time in austin. it s great bc it s open until super super late  3AM. just know that after midnight they tend to close their register so they accept cash only after. all of the tacos are super good. get both salsas  
El Tacorrido,100,Good food. I got carnitas and pastor. Meat was tender and properly cooked. I feltnit was lacking flavor but otherwise good. The verde sauce is great. It s creamy and has just enough spice.
El Tacorrido,101,Go North on Lamar and right before you hit Rundberg start looking left in the  Advance Auto Parts  parking lot. There will be a neon lit  aluminum sided constructed taco stand. It s not a trailer  it s not a truck  it lacks wheels.The fact that it is constructed demonstrates that it is an established business that appreciates sanitary standards and professionalism. The facts that the menu is offered in English and Spanish and they only accept cash demonstrates that this is a roots  common folk taco stand. This is El Tacorrido.  I have been here maybe 5 times  and every time I try a new cut of meat. The true artistry behind their craft is that they take lesser valued cuts of meat and marinate them to bring out new flavor. Any schmuck can sear a Kobe steak  charge  100  and be heralded as a master chef. True skill is required to take a tough cut of skirt steak  tinker the marinade recipe with the right amount of spices  and create the finished product of carne guisada. This product is then accented  not overpowered  with cilantro  onion  and lime and conferred to the customer via flour or corn tortilla. An asshole would charge  6-8 for this taco  an honest person would charge  1.75. El Tacorrido is an honest person.  The  El Pastor  and  Carne Guisada  are my personal favorite cuts of meat. I tried the fajita beef cut once  and it was a little tough and not up to the  El Tacorrido standards I have come to expect. It s something I would have expected from Hula Hut or some other dump that heats up meat they got off the Sysco truck.  I m an active young man and 3 tacos are sufficiently filling for me  4 if I m really hungry. My girlfriend is almost always content with 2  3 if she s starving.  Remember they only take cash. Don t complain  find a  10 bill and feed 2 people or take a handful of change out of the change jar and feed yourself. This place satisfies that taco craving you ve been having lately.
El Tacorrido,102,Love  love  love this place. I am here a couple times a week. Much more than a taco truck. Open late. Drive thru window is super convenient. If the line is long  they will come out and take pre-orders for the cars in que. Fast service. Tacos are reasonably priced. I like the beef fajita...Yes cilantro and onions please  Lime on the side is always juicy and fresh. Regular ole bacon egg and cheese for breakfast. Bacon is thick cut and a whole piece per taco. Dinner tacos are packaged on to go plates covered in foil. When we order several tacos on flour and several on corn  they will seperate the plates based on this without asking..... which is smart. His are corn  mine are flour. Breakfast tacos wrapped in foil. Mexican coke  sangria  soda cans even if you prefer  which I do . Menudo only on the weekends. Family style meat by the pound. They will often have a sign that warns they are only accepting cash.   NOTE.....General taco stand gripe  why doesn t any of them serve sides of rice and beans    This would greatly enhance my north Lamar taco experience.   Thanks for consistent  quality tacos 
El Tacorrido,103,It happened again. It s about 10 30 p.m. My roommate and I have just finished running too many miles and we are about to eat a bowl of cereal or heat up a can of ravioli because we are too hungry to make anything legitimate for... dinner.  But then the hunger for something great takes over and all of a sudden  we are pulling up to a cute  petite taco hut. Yes  it happened again. But who said it was a bad thing     The tacos are  1.75 each and they come with fresh onions  cilantro and a lime wedge. My favorite meats - Barbacoa  carnitas and al pastor - are delicious  even with the little pieces of meat fat my health conscious mind chooses to ignore because it s so good. The tortillas may be slightly smaller than the usual  but they pack the meat in  so after 2 tacos  I m a very  very happy girl.  I ve always ended up going around 10 or 11  but they are open early and close late. They close at 3 a.m. on the weekends to serve the nearby club crowds I ve heard. One time there were just 2 other people and around the same time on another occasion  the place was packed  so it varies on how busy it is  but they are pretty fast at getting the food out. Standing room and seating is tight  maybe 10 stools   but people usually eat fast or get it to go. They also have a drive through   Also  they sell their meat by the pound  so who s ready to come over for a party   I mean  I end up there all the time anyways  so what s picking up some meat in bulk   Ahh 
El Tacorrido,104,Well  I ve had two experiences at this place  so it s about time to write them up.   The first experience was when I d had a little bit of the drinky-poo  and discovered that my dinner party wasn t really serving dinner. And by the time I figured that out  it was midnight or somesuch time.   On the short drive home  I remembered Tacorrido and decided to give  er a try. Why  Because they were open late  And I d heard good things and all  but....yeah...open late.   I explained to the guy that I wanted a torta with no meat. Just extra avocados and maybe some frijoles spread in there. And I got some salsa to go with it. Which one  F-uck  I dunno  I d been drinking  Leave me alone with the third degree already  I m sorry  baby  you know I can t stay mad at you.  Anyway  it was good. I mean  what I remember of it was great late-night torta  But i can t recall all the details. Must be my age catching up with me.   Today  I went by there again because I was starving and it was once again close by and convenient.   There was a line at the drive through. I waited patiently  and a nice lady came out to take my order while I was in line. Nice  no  Well  she spoke much less english than the guy I d dealt with before  or perhaps I was just more in the  zona  last time where languages don t matter    so I had to explain to her the concept of no meat  extra avocado  etc. Fortunately  I thought I was able to do so  but I didn t want to go into frijoles al entro.   Crema  Lechuga  Tomate  Queso y Aguacate   Si.   Well  now I remember why having the frijoles in there makes it better. Because other than that  all you have is a cold torta. An ensalada sammich. And that wouldn t have been as frustrating if they d not forgotten to toast the bread  not put any extra avocados in  forgotten the crema  and forgotten my salsa.  El sigh.  I ll try them again  but it certainly wasn t the great sammy I remember from the last time I was there. Too bad.
El Tacorrido,105,Wow. Phenomenal eatin  here  no doubt in my mind. El Tacorrido is undoubtedly grounds for the label of  good  but ordinary taco stand  in Mexican food-dense NoAu. Is that a hip term we can use now  pronounced No Ow--North Austin    This stand has a few stands for siteating  standing eating sitting . Most people just do drive-through  I presume.  They have a good amount of salsas  pickled veggies  and the like. I assume all are made in-stand  The pricing is a bit higher than most  but the quality is superb  making the fee much worth it.  Best cactus  bar none. They cook these up  and these native plants are soft  savory  and hearty. I got it with cheese  and the dairy product and dessert-based object just melted into one another. The doubled-up corn tortillas held up perfectly. Refried beans were hearty and well seasoned. The potatoes were the soft  overcooked kind. Not the microwaved  pre-prepared  day-before leftover tubers that so often find their way into the epitome of mediocrity in the Austin breakfast staples.  I guess I should mention how awesome the corn tortillas here are. They are awesome. Also  the verde and molcajete salsas will get your sinuses running. On another note  I hate radishes... but their radish salsa was great stuff.  I  without any hesitation  invite you to eat at the wonder that is El Tacorrido  You will not be disappointed  and I will receive praise for having directed you there 
El Tacorrido,106, Cards accepted now  and that makes me come here even more often.   Always good  I love this place. I end up stopping by a few times a week. Everyone s friendly  and the tacos are amazing  The pastor is killer  and my favorite breakfast tacos around.
El Tacorrido,107,Cheap tacos   Yes.   5 for two tacos and a Sidral Mexican soda is a heck of a deal anywhere you go.    Good tacos   Debatable.  I ve had the al pastor  carnitas  and pollo before.  I was disappointed that none had great flavor  although all were fairly substantial in size.    The best thing of El Tacorrido is easily the molcajete salsa.  Muy caliente  bold in flavor  smokey--essentially everything you want in a great salsa.   Anyway  I ve decided that if I owned El Taccorido the first thing I d do is change the name to  The Sauce is Boss  because  other than the cheap-ass tacos  that s why you re really coming here.
El Tacorrido,108,Best tacos that I ve ever had. My favorite are the Barbara Koa tacos  They re open pretty late also which is awesome. So addicting to eat  I have to watch myself. The prices are great. Yummy.
El Tacorrido,109,I went there last Saturday at about 4 30 in the afternoon  because that was when I was off of work.   I work a few jobs right now  so my time off is valuable and limited.  So the prices are good.  The fish tacos are awesome.  I love the queso and chips as well.  When I met my husband over there  though  the man taking our order kept saying we went at the  wrong time  because they were  out of everything ..I told him that was the only time I could get there and he said we really needed to get there after 5 or 6.  Uh  okay.....  He made sure to tell us that if we asked about any menu item  that they were just really out of everything  no matter what it was .  He was such an annoying.  They clearly advertise that they are open from 7 AM - 11PM DAILY  so I don t know why they just don t shut down if they are going to be  out of everything  at certain times that they can apparently predict.  He kept telling us this like we should have known but I had never been there before.  I give their food and Mexican Cokes 4 stars but there service was not good.   That is why it gets 2 stars.  It would be nice for them to understand that we all cannot possibly know when they are out of things.  Especially new customers.    I don t know if we will go back because the service.  Try the food  if you can get past the condescending service attitude.
El Tacorrido,110,I cannot say enough good things about this quaint taco stand on N. Lamar. I used to live near it and recently moved. I now go out of my way to grab my favorite tacos.   PROS  -They have walk up service and drive thru -nice big vertical neon sign blinks  open  to let you know  -they are open late on the weekends and I believe til 12am during the week -the tacos are so tasty    I love them so much I haven t tried a quesadilla or torta or even the breakfast tacos   CONS   -cash only  but hey we should all be used to this in Austin by now -they recently had a price increase  but it was subtle  the tacos are still under 2 bucks each   1.75  used to be  1.50   Go and try the tacos. My favorite is the barbacoa and they ask if you want flour or corn tortilla  cilantro and onions  and if they remember they ll give you a sliced lime - - and it is heaven on a plate.
El Tacorrido,111,Now that s a good  no-nonsense taco. I sampled Carnitas  Al Pastor and Carne Guisada. One complaint I sometimes have with fast-and-cheap taco purveyors is that the meats aren t very well-differentiated  and tend to taste about the same. That wasn t a problem here - each was distinctively spiced and prepared. The Al Pastor had more sweet pineapple flavor than most examples I ve tried. Salsas are not at all shy  I had the molcajete and the verde de aguacate  and neither could be accused of blandness.  One thing I particularly like about this place is that it nods towards both the hip and the authentic in a very natural way. Minimalist chic architecture and smart  simple menus meet a barely-speaks-English cast of clientele and servers. Service was efficient  and portions   value were not lacking. Look forward to working up the moxie to try some of the more  exotic  meat selections  including pork skin and stomach.
El Tacorrido,112,Can t beat the quality price ratio. This is probably my favorite taco stand in Austin.
El Tacorrido,113,Nasty place .... the guy that drive delivery truck some meet fall in to ground and to his  boots and he pick it up and put it with rest of the meet... I use to come here almost avery single day but no more  This just happen today.... Nasty he Did not care that I was looking...
El Tacorrido,114,Mexican  To-Go  that stands up to any restaurant  The location sucks  I get it. But  its worth the tricky maneuvering to get into this Odd Lot. The veggie taco was Stupendously unique. Queso Blanco was swimming with FRESH veggies and accompanied by a BOAT LOAD of thick  homemade chips. My meat man had the carne guisada and carnitas tacos and was equally impressed  this from an hombre who KNOWS his Tacos Autenticos   We left with 2 bags of FRESHLY prepared food and a drink in under 5 minutes and for less than  20.   The owners are first timers to the restaurant biz according to the pleasant Gringa who was lovingly packing our delicacies. Show your tummy and these neighborhood newbies some LOVE  Arrrriba 
El Tacorrido,115,The food was amazing  very flavorful and with great prices. For sure an easy recommendation for friends
El Tacorrido,116,Wow. For taco trucks in Texas  this is on the top ten for sure    I got four tacos  filled up with three however but managed to try out some of their different meats. Buche is the top dog here. Get three of these and enjoy.
El Tacorrido,117,I will start by saying that this place has the best Al Pastor taco I ve ever had in my life   My first visit was on a Friday evening around 8pm on the way home from the lab. I pulled up and ordered. I looked around and realize I was the only white person there.  A good sign when buying Mexican food   I ordered  the amazing  Al Pastor taco  a bean and nopales taco  and a mexican coke. The Al Pastor taco even had chunks of pineapple in it  They also serve breakfast tacos all day.   This is a little shed mini house in a parking lot  so they only have a little counter on their deck area. They have salsa in maple syrup containers and paper towel racks on the walls  everything a girl could ask for.   I went back another time on a Saturday at 3pm and it was absolutely packed. No room at the counter and the drive-thru had a long line.
El Tacorrido,118,Um. I want to pick up this taco stand  carry it to my house  and plop it down in the backyard I don t have so I can selfishly enjoy their tacos al pastor anytime I want  which happens to be all the time. But since I m totally generous  and I don t have a backyard  I ll leave them be so everyone else can experience their magic. Luckily  I can still have their tacos al pastor basically anytime I want since they re open from 6 am to 3 am every single day. No that s not a typo. They re closed just 3 hours a day  and for that  I am thankful.  Did I mention their tacos al pastor and how authentically delicious they are  I m talkin   taste just like the ones I adored so much when I studied abroad in Cuernavaca  authentic. and the salsas  All of them  Holy moses. Even their freaking quesadillas somehow taste infinitely better than all other quesadillas  that all tend to taste the same .   Plus the price is just as awesome as the rest.  1.75 a taco  Don t mind if I do.  I love you el tacorrido. I don t know how you do it  but whatever it is  don t  ever stop. You will be catering my wedding someday.   Ps. Since I like to keep things in the family  I m trying out brother Takoba  on east 7th  this weekend  I hear there s a beach and margaritas. Dont worry El tacorrido  you ll always be my number one regardless  and not just because you re  closer to my house.
El Tacorrido,119,Bland taste  under cooked potato s  and over priced. They charge for extra salsa  yet when I ask for it  then they forget. This is a common occurrence.  I will not be going back.
El Tacorrido,120,I m so glad I came here  First of all  the guy at the window was super friendly and nice and humored me while I rambled on about how the car in front of me went and parked  so I thought I needed to go park and wait for my order . He just smiled and laughed  which happens to be more than I get from close friends when I ramble on and on.   Okay  now the food. It was pretty damn good. I got breakfast tacos with red salsa and the red salsa was nice and spicy and flavorful  I have a things about flour tortillas in Austin  and while these were not the worst flour tortillas  they were just not like the homemade flour tortillas you find in San Antonio. That is the only reason for no 5 stars. I will definitely be back to this place  I love the convenience of a drive through with the friendly employees and the delicious tacos--it s a winning combination 
El Tacorrido,121,I love authentic Mexican tacos and this is pretty much that. The only thing I wish was that there was more on the menu to try 
El Tacorrido,122,So yes there are plenty of tacos and breakfast tacos in Austin. Of course they re not all created equally. When I first moved here about 5 years ago I was just happy to eat breakfast tacos. Now after scoping the taco scene a while I ve realized where the good ones are. Most places allow 2 complimentary toppings and eggs are one of those toppings. So those of us who like cheese and another topping like bacon or potato have to pay extra which puts even the dollar tacos at about a  1.50. My experience with dollar tacos is that they are small. Well El Tacoriddo allows 3 toppings before charging for extras for  2 a piece. What  what   They re also packed full and filling. They re sauces are kickin too. Best pick you up some. Oh  and the bacon is CRISPY  
El Tacorrido,123,I work late and I was craving Mexican  so of course I turned to Yelp for assistance in finding a good place that was still open at 2 a.m. El Tacorrido caught my eye  it was well rated and not too far away. I was feeling adventurous so I made the trek to N. Lamar.   I tried the tortas carnitas  which was delicious. Everything tasted fresh and I loved the avocado slices in the sandwich. The only thing that seemed to be missing was refried beans  but on the other hand I am glad they were not included as the sandwich tasted great just the way it was.   The downside is that the restaurant is in a slightly scary neighborhood  late at night . I felt like the only woman around when I walked up and ordered  so I felt a little out of place. However  everybody was friendly  so my perception is mainly a getting-out-of-your-comfort zone thing that comes with going to a taco stand at 2 a.m. while dressed up in career clothing. I will probably use the drive-thru next time 
El Tacorrido,124,Ok  so... some friends introduced this little tiny taco stand to me about 3 or 4 months ago  and I am IN LOVE.  This place is open from 6 am to 3 am every day  which is a big bonus for me - I drive past it on my way to work in the morning  so it s nice it s open that early.  At least 3 days a week  sometimes 4   I go here  and whereas sometimes there s a dude there  most of the time it s two women and I always get to order in Spanish.  I dig that it s cash only and I order in Spanish - makes me feel like I m being  authentic  even though I know that breakfast tacos are Tex-Mex  not Mexican.  Anyhow  the service is always quick  and I usually get the same thing  one bean  amp  cheese taco on a flour tortilla  one bacon  egg  REAL EGG  mind you  not the 99  egg mixture you tend to get a lot of places   and cheese on a flour tortilla  salsa roja.  I ve only had their molcajete and salsa roja and whereas my friends have a weaker palate than I and prefer the molcajete  I LOVE the kick the salsa roja has.  One of these days  I ll be heading there to pick up lunch or dinner  but in the meantime I m going to now get back to today s breakfast... I just realized I should post this review while I m thinking of it.  Oh  and today I got an extra taco - it doesn t happen often  but at least once every couple of weeks  when the Spanish-speaking lady is working the window  I get three tacos so have one to eat for lunch or to give to a friend at the office.  Not bad at all for  3.50   Oh  and if I add in a Mexican Coke  it s only  5.25 - CHEAP AND TASTY MEAL FTW 
El Tacorrido,125,The menudo and pastor is always just perfect.  Every time we go we ask for extra tortillas to enjoy more tacos when you buy by the pound.  The place could use a credit card Mashine and better customer service when the owner is not there. But overall it s very good and convenient drive through.
El Tacorrido,126,Hands down my absolute favorite taco stand  Very affordable  delicious tacos  And they re opened late for late night cravings  Love it  My favorites are the barbacoa and al pastor  they re bomb  Must try for everyone who loves tacos  And don t forget the salsa verde   Seriously the best salsa verde I ve ever had 
El Tacorrido,127,After months of waiting  the new El Tacorrido at S. 1st and Oltorff has finally opened  and it was worth the wait.  I tried the carne guisada  carnitas  and pollo tacos.  All delicious.  Salsa  also excellent.  Queso  quite good.  Chips  a little think for my taste  but they do hold up well for dipping in the queso.    Delicious drive-thru tacos just blocks from my house.  My diet is screwed.
El Tacorrido,128,I ve upgraded the review to 4 stars on the basis of the  revuelta  taco only. A mix of carnitas  cuerito   amp  buche  it s the right kind of flavorful  fatty  and hearty. Only eat one per month unless you want to invite a heart attack 
El Tacorrido,129,I have tried this place a couple of times to see for myself and I just don t get all the praise as the food is just meh. If folks think these are the best tacos and tortas around then they haven t been around much.  The tacos are actually small for the price. I had various tacos  pastor  carnitas and carne guisada. I then tried a torta with bistec which was disappointing. Of any  the carnitas was the best although it was dry. The carne guisada is a bit odd  it s basically a beef stew but here there is no stew as in a gravy  it was more shredded beef in some juices. The only redeming salsa is the green sauce but you can get that other places.   The search continues......
El Tacorrido,130,Great tacos  super salsa especially the green   Hot enough to keep me happy.  Everything on the menu seems to be good.   Glad they have a drive-through  too.  Wish they had iced tea though..
El Tacorrido,131,Best tacos  And simple menu which is great. It might be small but the business is fast quick and very yummy
El Tacorrido,132,This is my favorite place to get tacos in Austin   Seriously delicious and authentic Mexican food  amp  phenomenal breakfast tacos     amp  there s a drive thru. Heaven.
El Tacorrido,133,idiotas de mierda   c mo se puede no No se c mo hacer un buen desayuno taco   Me das asco    traer perjuicio a la comida mexicana  eres una broma  nos est s jugando   qu  pasa con esa salsa  Horrible    This review is for the breakfast tacos only.  Gotta go two stars on these guys.  My first visit I got some chorizo  egg and cheese  CEX  for me and my Puerto Rican buddy.  We were both impressed that they had absolutely no grease   For  1.75 on a three item taco  I m thinking  good deal .  Portion wise  yes  good deal.  Quality  My friend looked at me and made the disclaimer   Dude  these are white boy taco s  .  Do you remember the Wendy s T.V. commercials from the 80 s   Yep   We were like  WHERE S THE CHORIZO         Seriously  it was more like a egg and cheese taco.  It did have some meat in it  but  you couldn t taste any flavor except a hint of a little smoke. Not sure we got chorizo.  So far  for me and my buddy  we are keen on the CEX from Enchilada s Y Mas  EYM .   I have become a salsa snob.  I like to taste flavor and onions and peppers and garlic.  I don t want a salsa that bears the consistency of water.  They gave me two salsa s.  Both were tossed in the trash.  The red salsa was very runny and had a overwhelming tomato flavor.  Very bland.  The green salsa was  well  is hard to describe.  Maybe like blending avocado and water   There is a third salsa available  but  they really push these two that are blah  at best.  Not sure what s up with that.  Went back another day and ordered my favorite breakfast taco   Sausage  egg and cheese.  AKA  SEX.  Oh man.  I swore to never have SEX again   This was such a disgusting greasy mess  that  I told myself it had to be a off day or something.  When I got to work and took that taco out of the bag my morning went to Hell in a hand basket.  I was appalled at the amount of grease coming from that taco.  Thankfully the napkins that were in the bag absorbed some of it  which I m certain kept the taco from escaping the bag.  I unwrapped the foil  and  WOW   The tortilla was all slimy from the grease.  I peeled the tortilla apart and  began investigating.  There was a decent amount of sausage to egg ratio.  The cheese was focused in the center of the taco.  This was the same case with the CEX taco s also.  Unfortunately the amount of grease out trumped all other ingredients.  Nonetheless  I dared a bite.  Yep  it was as nasty as it looked   That  1.75 went straight to the trash can.  For the time being I m keeping my SEX at EYM  they are the reason I use abbreviations on my breakfast taco s   Dan s  and  Donut Taco Palace III. este lugar est  fuera de mi lista no jodas con mis tacos
El Tacorrido,134,CASH ONLY  I do commercial installs for TWC  amp  they have an SMC modem right there inside the window for something. Eff em  I ll go elsewhere.
El Tacorrido,135,This place gets no stars. I went there after reading a online blog about their horchata and espresso drink they make only to be told no. They don t have it and never will again. How can you be given free publicity and then not serve the product. I don t understand. Not to mention the lady at the window was rude  I ll just go to another local place that can provide proper service and not lie about the menu.
El Tacorrido,136,Ohh Hell No  Dropped by this odd little shack in the middle of a strip mall parking lot on Tuesday afternoon. You order through a tiny window and sit in this weird  holding cage .   Ordered the al pastor and carne asada tacos. Both were small baja-sized tortillas and way overpriced    1.75. Meats on both these tacos were way over salted. Carne Asada taco was actually on the cold side.  Spot not worth messing with.
El Tacorrido,137,great tacos but the staff is not so friendly. also the wait during lunch time is crazy  but they have a drive thru and walk in for your convenience
El Tacorrido,138,I give it a 10  We ve actually tried a couple of places here in Austin and my boyfriend and I were super disappointed as we LOVE food especially tacos so we were kind of hesitant to try this one. It s sort of in the hood but hey that s the best tacos right  Line was long... and for a damn good reason it took about 15-20 minutes for our tacos and we were not one bit disappointed. Authentic street tacos with amazing green salsa. We both got one Barbacoa and one el pastor and both were mouth watering and full of flavor  If your looking for authentic street tacos here in Austin TRY THIS place don t risk the disappointment like we did.
El Tacorrido,139,Holy smokes this place is a find. I work with a guy who s originally from Mexico and knows the best taco stands in town. He d told me about this place and I finally got to try it. While I wasn t a big fan of the al pastor  the carnitas and barbacoa are fantastic. Salsa is great too and the price is right. Only drawback is lack of seating and cash only. No gripes whatsoever about the food. It definitely helps if you speak a little Spanish since there can be a language barrier with the employees.
El Tacorrido,140,Great tasting tacos but a little on the pricey side. The fish tacos were my favorite although they were messy. It s worth a try.
El Tacorrido,141,I was hoping for some bomb ass tacos to make the extra long wait worth it but nope I ve had way way better  
El Tacorrido,142,I tried this place the other day for lunch. It was very reasonably priced and they were very friendly. I tried the carnitas  which were very good. They suggested I try the green sauce. Even though I m not a green sauce fan  it was good. I still like the red sauce better. I will definitely be going back many times.
El Tacorrido,143,The BEST tacos in Austin  hands down   Service is always super quick and extremely friendly  Their salsa is amaaazing and they sell it in larger sizes for you to take home.
El Tacorrido,144,Tried pastor and carne asada  way too salty and not much flavor.  Pastor was greasy and bland and the beef was sodium loaded  so much  my tongue was numb.   For a  1.75 a taco  I want plenty of meat and flavor  both were lacking.  Funky place  the girls you order from don t speak any english  but they got the order correct so that was a plus.  Keep driving 
El Tacorrido,145,YUMMMMMMMM     Gimme dat taco  Breakfast tacos are on point      I LOOOOOOOOVE the horchata and espresso. I believe it s called the equinox or something. Buy gawdayum it s good.
El Tacorrido,146,Still dedicated to this taco shack restaurant  It is amazing everytime  I come 2-5 times a week  Always the best service  Always the best food  Breakfast tacos are the best in all of TEXAS 
El Tacorrido,147,If you want authentic mexican tacos come here you wont be disappointed  i come here any chance i get i try to control myself because just like candy this place becomes addicting 
El Tacorrido,148,We had already purchased a lot of food and drinks and then our toddler started crying and wanted water - they wouldn t give it to us unless we Purchased it for another .50 - pretty low  Very rude  and unnecessary
El Tacorrido,149,I just discovered this place yesterday and have already eaten there three times  My new favorite spot in Austin. The green sauce is delicious and their gorditas are authentic. I can t wait to try everything in the menu.
El Tacorrido,150,The place is tiny as hell  not much more than a 5 person bar to sit. But the food is so worth it. I grew up in Mission TX and after moving to Austin in 2008 I have never been able to find those street tacos that remind me of home.  No frills  no BS  simply bistec  cilantro  onion and lime on a double corn tortilla  that s a perfect taco.
El Tacorrido,151,El Taccorido has some of the best tacos known to man.    El Taccorido is one of the best real Mexican food places outside of my homeland   says  native Mexican and El Taccorido advocate  Jaime Alessio.               Ask a Taccorido employee where the restrooms are. He will point you to the Popeyes across the street. So you take the walk across Oltorf and enter Popeyes. Only to find out you have to buy something in order to use the restroom. Awesome. Wait in a 10 minute line. Buy a 79 cent biscuit. Wait for biscuit. Get biscuit. Throw biscuit away. Finally...use restroom.          Pull up to Taccorido and enter one of its two drive-thrus. Wait for someone to take your order. No one calls through the telecom. You say  hello  any one there    no answer. So you continue to wait. Wait some more.  Welcome to El Taccorido  could you wait for a moment sir   in a choppy spanish accent.  Ugh I guess . Wait some more.  Now I m ready  How can I help you    Ya  could I get 5 tacos al pastor and 2 bean and cheese tacos.   Will that be all sir    Oh  also two horchatas. One with no ice   large or small    Smalls   Okay your total will be 10 dollars.   Thank you ma am . Wow ten dollars  thats the deal of a life time. No joke. Where else can you fill up two starving  teenage boys for ten dollars  And not just fill us up. We re good for two meals after eating this one. Go to Taco Deli and your meal will be twenty bucks at least.              So after waiting a century for our meal. We drive off. Halfway to our eating destination we bring out the tacos.  There are 2 bean and cheese tacos and 3 tacos al pastor. Awesome. They messed up our order.                Why would anyone want to go back to such a poorly-run rodent-infested bathroom-less dilapidated establishment  The damn tacos. They are awesome. Just awesome. The way the pork acts like a sponge and soaks up the pineapple sauce is unbeatable. And wow  the grilled tortillas accent the meat so well it leaves you salivating after the last bite. Your first thought when you finish your last bite is when will I be back again  No one can just follow directions and create this masterpiece. Although it might sound clich   these tacos are made with love. The tacos are worth the biscuit buying  the pest infestation  and the incapable taco counter. The tacos are worth the wait. Not everyone is a fan.          True  almost everything about El Taccorido is awful. But  almost  is the key word. El Taccorido proves that the success of the restaurant  what encourages customer loyalty  is not the decor  not the service  not the location  but quite simply  the quality of the food. Some restaurants can give you all these things  but good old Austin lets a restaurant like this survive  viva El Taccorido 
El Tacorrido,152,1st and last time. Ordered chicken quesadilla.  Specifically asked for just chicken and cheese. No vegetables. It had a lot of grilled onions and bell pepper and barely any chicken  I don t know what kind of cheese they use but I didn t like it it was thick and gooey and stuck in the roof of my mouth and gums also there was a hair on my plate. Also ordered a carnitas taco it was pretty bland and dry. My boyfriend also ordered a chicken taco and asked for no onions and received a lot of onion and bell pepper and barely any chicken. Pretty disappointed because most of the reviews seemed good.
El Tacorrido,153,Seriously my number one taco spot. I ve been coming here for years and I still go here. Doesn t matter when my taco cravings hit  THIS IS THE SPOT 
El Tacorrido,154,Lovely little place  great service and delicious breakfast tacos. It s very cheap  but the quality is upscale pretty much.
El Tacorrido,155,All the tacoas. So Bomb. Breakfast tacos slam with an iced horchata with espresso. Pretty fast  people are nice. Man its good.  2 tacos cant beat that. In fact...I want it right now...
El Tacorrido,156,My favorite quick taco spot.  Not to mention  the price is unbeatable.  Only problem is that sometimes the line takes a little while.  Besides that  the tacos are great.
El Tacorrido,157,Brought two out of town coworkers here for a late night bite to eat.  Excellent street tacos.  Damn good food at a great price.
El Tacorrido,158,Food is descent.  The service however is terrible. I waited for an order that they took wrong longer than when it first came out. Evening crew is smug and not friendly. Lunch crew is a lot nicer.
El Tacorrido,159,This is my favorite place to get tacos in Austin.  They have this amazing avocado salsa that they make fresh every day  along with this spicy salsa that will rock your world.  The carnitas  pastor and barbacoa are to die for and are only  1.50 each   I don t think you can find a better taco stand in Austin than El Tacorrido.  This place is always packed  but they get your food out quickly.  I highly recommend checking it out if you re a fan of real mexican tacos.
El Tacorrido,160,it s open late  2  dollars a pop  tastes pretty good  what can I say 
El Tacorrido,161,Al pastor on corn tortillas yummmmm. This place is the best when it comes to late night tacos in Austin.
El Tacorrido,162,I m conflicted between wanting to keep this fine establishment a yelp-free zone  and to publicly declare how much I love this place.  This is not your  white  mama s taco....but it is so good that I would take my mama there  and so should youthat is  provided that your mama would dig some seriously fabulous fire in your mouth and melt-in-your mouth meats   barbacoa  pollo  pastor  carnitas  chiccarrons.  I ve had them all  and loved them all   and I want more  and at  1.50 each I can eat a lot.  Don t forget your mexican coke because when you douse your tacos with any of their awesome salsas  you ll need it.
El Tacorrido,163,Incompetence. I ordered breakfast tacos and they gave me pork. I DON T  UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES  EAT PORK. Upon calling  they refused to give a refund and wanted me to drive 15 minutes there and back at 1am to receive the right order. Incompetence and bad customer service 
El Tacorrido,164,Cash Only   and if you forget the staff will kindly point to the ATM thats in the same parking lot. Ive had the beef torta and tacos. AOK Good. Go for it. Do it.
El Tacorrido,165,Very nice people  even with the language barrier they try to make sure you are happy. Food is spectacular  Bistec tacos are my favorite 
El Tacorrido,166,Holy yum.  Dear Carnitas on corn tortilla with creamy green sauce  how I love thee.
El Tacorrido,167,Your breakfast tacos  and especially the green sauce  were delicious today  so I will forgive you just this once for the 15 minute wait in the drive-through.  Seriously  having the rear end of my car hanging out as traffic on Oltorf whizzed by really made it hard to want to stay.
El Tacorrido,168,What you want is the taco revuelta  a tripartite pig confection composed of carnitas  cuerita   slow-cooked pork skin    and buche   slow-cooked pork stomach    which yields a toothsome combination of flavors  savory  salty  earthy  and textures  tender  rubbery  crispy . It s easily one of the best tacos in town.
El Tacorrido,169,Best Mexican tacos. I come here at least once a week. Always busy but very fast prompt service. This is one place you must come and visit if your in Austin. Try it and trust me you will love it
El Tacorrido,170,The food is always great and the service has always been with a smile  it s a great place to eat at after a party if ur in the mood for some real Mexican food.
El Tacorrido,171,I m normally not crazy about tacos but these were so good  The meat was so tender and flavorful. The green sauce burned my tongue  Cheap and delicious     
El Tacorrido,172,Breakfast tacos all day  and they are good   Very reasonable prices   1.75 for most .We tried different meats on both flour and corn tortillas just to taste test.  Next time we are going to order their option for the meal  1 lb of meat  tortillas  onion  cilantro  lime etc - menu says enough for 10-12 tacos and for  14 that makes it a much better value .  Not the best area late at night but we aren t out late anyways so it s never been an issue.
El Tacorrido,173,The best in Austin  Love this place. Carne Asada is my taco of choice. I ve seen the amount of food that comes out of this place and it all looks and smells amazing  All of the great reviews are well deserved. I will be going back to eat here and I will do another review soon.. I go at least twice a week and more when my husband works late. They have great hours and great customer service. When you see this place stop by  trust me you will not be disappointed 
El Tacorrido,174,My husband got three tacos and told them we did NOT want anything spicy and they failed to notify us that the chicharron was spicy. I ordered a torta and it was okay nothing special but EXTREAMLY SMALL. For  5.50 I expected a bigger torta. We will not come back         
El Tacorrido,175,visiting from out of town....these tacos are amazeballs    cheap and delicious. excellent for a quick eat or to stuff your face.
El Tacorrido,176,Got two tacos here for less than one at Torchy s  and they were almost as good. Bistec isn t the  pretty  fajita meat  it s a little crumbly but still good. Probably wouldn t drive out of my way to get here  but I was not disappointed.
El Tacorrido,177,Had a carnitas w onion and cilantro and it rocked my world. Their sauces are tasty with a nice kick to it. I wished I lived in Austin to have access to this place. Yum 
El Tacorrido,178,Oh my  All I can say yummmm   I had the carnitas tacos on corn...wow  My hubby had the chicken fajitas and he ordered more to go after we ate our first order. We need a place like this in Cedar Park...STAT 
El Tacorrido,179,Nice addition to South Central Austin.  We really needed a taco drive thru.  I went a few times but two out of three I found the tacos needed just a little more filling in them.  I really liked the fish taco and the veggie taco with the sweet potato was a pleasant surprise.  I hope that for the price they start adding more filling so I can make this a regular stop.
El Tacorrido,180,I ve been on a kick to find the best drive through taco in my neighborhood. Sorry this one wasn t the winner. It was quite an interesting place though. The little cage at the front where you can sit wasn t very inviting. When I drove over to the drive through the window was very high...guess most of the eaters have trucks. The tacos were pretty small. I had the carne guisada  the al pastor and a bean   cheese. They were all just ok. Meat was a little fatty and wasn t fond of the guisada. I did like that they had a variety of salsas. Overall the experience was odd.
El Tacorrido,181,Decent Mexican fast food  chorizo recommended. Relatively inexpensive  but it seems the tacos have gotten smaller--which is fine  just a sign of thinning margins. They have a history of messing up my order  something I don t realize until I m home--because who opens up their tacos to check 
El Tacorrido,182,Al pastor tacos are worth the drive uptown. All three sauces were flavorful and mild to just under spicy. Quick service and friendly. If the guy isn t upfront working the counter  not speaking English can be a slight issue. I ve eaten here 10 times in 6 months and the food is always fresh and consistent. And that s the key  consistency. Highly recommended  but you ll want to grab and go  not a great neighborhood to hand out in.
El Tacorrido,183,I LOVE this place  My boyfriend and I go here at least 2-3 times a week for breakfast  lunch or dinner. Always a friendly staff and a DELICIOUS taco 
El Tacorrido,184,Yep  this is the best place I ve eaten. Period. Not the best Mexican food or the best tacos. The best place I ve ever eaten. Ever. It s flawlessly consistent. Everything they serve is top notch. Buche  Ravuelta  pastor  etc etc... Unreal.
El Tacorrido,185,Great taco stand   I went yesterday afternoon  and it was busy around 1pm  drive thru and small seating area.  If you re looking for really authentic  great tasting bites  this is the place.  The menu is small  but the ingredients are what make the food.  You can choose from tacos  tortas  quesadilla  or gorditas.  There are around 7-8 meats  or inerds if you will.  At the bottom  are breakfast optiosn served all day  egg  ham  bacon  chroizo  cheese  beans  nopales.....  The small stand is open late  and even till 3am on weekends.  When you walk up to the window  they ll ask for your order  on corn  dbl corn tortillas   flour  and if youd like it with cilantro and or onion diced.  There are several sauce pitchers going around as well  the best is the creamy tasting avocado jap like sauce.  You can also get them to go  or do the drive thru.  The carnitas  buche  pork stomach   barbacoa  beef cheek   chicharon  and the pastor are all awesome   For a 1.50 each taco  less for breakfast  and around 3.00 for torta  quesadilla  and gordita  the prices are cheap.  Menudo is offered on the weekends also   Be ready to try and order in spanish  or have someone order for you.  Great tacos  ingredients condiments  mexican sodas and friendly also.  I ll be back  this time to pick up dozens to go  
El Tacorrido,186,I tried them out today and what I had there was really nothing special.  I ordered two tacos  one al pastor and one with chicken.  The al pastor seemed like stewed pork  maybe they gave me the wrong thing   and the chicken taco contained basic strips of chicken  sort of like the bag of fajita chicken from HEB.  The corn tortillas were store bought and had a plain flavor.  Overall the tacos were... meh .
El Tacorrido,187,Gotta be the best late night place to get tacos.  They are all really tasty and a great value for your money.  Cash only and they get pretty slammed after closing time so be prepared for that.  But  totally worth it.
El Tacorrido,188,Simply put  it s delicious  Meat is relatively tender  and very flavorful  and only  1.75 a taco  the size of it makes it perfect. there re 3 different sauces to choose from  simple and good. They only till 3 which makes perfect late night snacks. the only downside is they don t speak English  so that would make customizing the food difficult  but oh well  I ll just stick with the menu and it should go right.
El Tacorrido,189,My partner and I went on a Sunday night for the first time. There were several other people in the small patio with bar stool seating but there was space for us.  I had the barbacoa torta and it was awesome.  I probably could have eaten a larger one but it was plenty of food.  My partner tried three tacos  al pastor  pollo  and bistec  the pollo just being okay but the other two were delicious with the al pastor probably the best.  They weren t serving breakfast tacos for some reason even though it says they do all day so we didn t get to try one of those.  For a torta  3 tacos  and a horchata it was  12.75 which I think was a bargain. They are cash only.
Matt's El Rancho,1,The food was amazing and the service was even better. Vanessa was our server and provided the best service me and my group had ever received at a restaurant. Her diligence  attention to detail  and friendly attitude is second to none.
Matt's El Rancho,2,Food was great and staff was kind and welcoming. It was cool eating at a restaurant founded in Austin and with rich history. I love that the menu was affordable. I loved that they had options for outdoor and indoor seating. They also had plenty of parking spaces.
Matt's El Rancho,3,Have to give a shout out to Manager Israel who took the time to talk to me about take out issues   Service industry is struggling   Matts has always been the best and will always be the most amazing Mexican food in house or take out in Austin Texas    Remember to give them a break    And tip extra when you can  
Matt's El Rancho,4,I love Matt s and since moving out of town have we try to make a stop when in town.  This place gets crazy crowded so go early   They do NOT take reservations and won t seat you until your entire party is there but will put your name on the waitlist to keep you in line.   Best Mexican martini around   Queso is amazing   Service struggles a bit but given the crowds just be patient and know they are doing their best.   This place is Old Austin so skip the hip new places and eat like a local.  Go to Matt s 
Matt's El Rancho,5,After a work trip  I had an extra day to explore. Matt s continued to be a recommendation so I knew I had to go    I started with the frozen skinny margarita. The chips were soooooo fresh with a perfectly spicy salsa. I highly recommend ordering the Bob Armstrong dip and dunking that in salsa. It s the perfect bite as they dip itself isn t spicy at all. Then I had the beef combination lunch special. They didn t add cheese to the taco so I also recommend adding some of the dip on that as well.   This will be a  1 rec for anyone I hear is visiting Austin 
Matt's El Rancho,6,Man what a disappointment   had heard great things about this place  and so was really excited to go check it out.  Upon rolling up  that excitement grew even more because the parking lot is pure chaos  and it was packed  so I m thinking  it had to have been a good restaurant for sure  with this many people swarming about...... don t believe the hype folks  it s fake news    So the pros   1  service from our waiter Juan was amazing  he had a big party and some other tables he was waiting on  but still made sure to check on our party of two  He was great    2  the wait wasn t as long as they first quoted which was 1.5 hrs on a Thursday night  Can t even imagine in a weekend. But we only ended up waiting about 40-45 maybe. So not too bad  and they also text you so you can leave the area if you want to grab a drink nearby or something Ben grab a drink at the bar.   Cons  1  the thing that matters the most....the FOOD was just okay  nothing that stood out or made me want to eagerly return back. We got the  Asadero and Pecan Smoked Brisket tacos  and although the Asadero was good  it wasn t amazing or anything. The Smoked brisket one fell flat for me as well. Didn t have much flavor  and only tasted good once I added some of the salsa too it.   Needless to say I left feeling very underwhelmed by the food. Could ve saved those calories and gone somewhere else.
Matt's El Rancho,7,This is a tough one because this place is an Austin Institution and you can t knock 70 years of success.  That being said.....   Food - 4 Stars.....good   but nothing exceptional  Service - 3 Stars......Food was really slow coming out  never checked back for water refills or other drinks.  Server was OK but not overly friendly  Parking  - 2.5 Stars......Large lot but still difficult to find a Parking spot.  Would definitely eat there again  but only if I was in the neighborhood.  Not a place I would drive an hour to go to.
Matt's El Rancho,8,Not a place you come to for the food as this place is known for their KO Martini  you re given a martini glass  the initial pour and the rest of the shaker  probably another 2.5 pours  Need I say more .  Chips  amp  salsa are complimentary and my go-to dish here is the Ribeye   Enchilada. Servers are always attentive and if the weather is appropriate  sit out in the patio area. Vibes are solid 
Matt's El Rancho,9,Came here on the recommendation of a friend. It did not disappoint.  Atmosphere  The atmosphere is pretty lively. There is a good mix of indoor and outdoor seating and we were able to get an outdoor seat in the shade.  Drinks   We got some of knock out martinis. I like sweeter drinks and I liked these ones. It doesn t taste that strong but they definitely pack a punch.  Chips   Each chip is half a tortilla so they are really big. I found that I actually liked this a lot. I ended up breaking up the chips to my liking and you don t end up with small pieces that can t scoop anything. The salsa is hot and kinda watery. They give you a LOT of queso which is pretty good for the price. I liked the queso but everyone else seemed to love it. The guac was decent but not as worth it as the queso.  Fajitas  The fajitas were great. The waitress said she had never seen someone eat a 1lb before. It s big but if you re a big eater  you should have no problem finishing. The fajitas come with a lot of sides and the 1lb comes with more guac  sour cream and pico than the half pound but the same amount of rice and beans. The fajitas also come with a lot of onions and peppers.  Overall a great dinner. Would definitely come back.
Matt's El Rancho,10,The family and I went for dinner here last night. We were greeted quickly and w a smile by the front gals  Violet walked us to our table to be seated. Our sever was quick and friendly  and the food was soooo good  We got queso and tacos and a fish dish  It was crowded  and loud which are not my favorite things  but our over all experience was GREAT 
Matt's El Rancho,11,The food was definitely some of the better Mexican food I have had. The exception was the tortilla chips. They were not the best. The service was fairly quick and easy. Tons of people there but they were speedy. The queso was superb 
Matt's El Rancho,12,Matt s is world famous for a reason. I ve come here for years for family gatherings  birthdays  anniversaries  etc. I always order the same thing - the beef Chile relleno with ranchera sauce. Matt s makes it special - with raisins and pecans to give it a sweet and savory zip. The poblano pepper is always just the right amount of heat  and can be eaten down to the tip and I do  Today  I walked over after a haircut and decided to ask the waiter for nonalcoholic options besides soda. As a sober person in Austin  I usually make do with soda  but didn t want to today. To my great pleasure  he smiled and said he can do a virgin frozen margarita  daiquiri or even pina colada  He was attentive and charming and checked on periodically while the drink was being made. It took a few minutes  but I wasn t bothered. I sat outside today and enjoyed watching the fish in their fountain and feeling the breeze in the break between storms.   How amazing  time was Matt s didn t have these options. I ordered a virgin frozen Margarita and got to enjoy my delicious relleno with a sober adult beverage. No tequila  it had just the right mix of sweet and sour and melted delightfully so I finished as I enjoyed my lunch.  Matt s food is legendary  but I know they also cater to sobernauts in Austin  and what a thrill that is for me. You can feel marooned here if you don t drink  but today they showed me they love their sober customers as much as their others  and I am so happy. Here at Matt s you are treated like family  and I am so thrilled they are an Austin legend. I can t wait to go back  get my incredible relleno  and sample the other sober cocktails.
Matt's El Rancho,13,I LOVE IT HERE. The prickly pear margarita is the best margarita I ve ever had. The enchiladas are the best in Austin. I love the decor and the design of the restaurant. Outside they have a nice set up with tables and string lights. Depending on the waiter you get  they can be good or great 
Matt's El Rancho,14,My favorite go-to Tex-Mex restaurant which I ve frequented since 1979. Back then they were a mom-and-pop located on East 1st St. at the southbound feeder of IH35  where they d been open since the 50 s. Today they are much enlarged on S. Lamar but still have the same great food and outstanding service. Other restaurants could definitely take lessons from them on how to handle and move patrons with efficiency and a smile.   Their menu is not as extensive as some others  but it doesn t need to be. They believe in offering dishes that they do well  and that approach hasn t failed them for 70 years.  My favorites continue to be the crispy beef taco  the open style   their quesos  cheese enchiladas with Tex-Mex sauce  and the ground beef chile rellenos  served as they should be with ranchero sauce  cheese  sour cream  raisins and pecans. Don t argue with me on this--just try it   Also  they make their own corn tortillas  which they fry fresh to warmly accompany their tomato jalape o salsa whose heat depends on the jalape os. My favorite chips and salsa in town  They do have a full bar  and margaritas of all styles  including those made with fresh lime juice. Hint  if you ask for a fresh praline at the end of your meal  it used to be on the menu   they will bring you one free-of-charge  with more available for sale at the front resister.   This is a must for anyone seeking the real  unadulterated Austin experience.
Matt's El Rancho,15,The overall rating does not do this place justice. This food was sooooo good. Best Tex Mex I ve ever had. I had the chili rellenos and their signature queso. It was awesome. They kept bringing more chips  and with it being packed  we had our drinks refilled quickly without having to ask. I want to go back now 
Matt's El Rancho,16,Honestly  I am shocked this isn t rated higher.  We were recommended this place well visiting  and when we got there it was very busy. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We got the chicken and steak fajitas  and brisket tacos  and they were amazing. My husband said the brisket tacos were some of the best he s ever had  and the fajitas were flavored and cooked perfectly. We saw a sign that said the king up Mexican food and joked that we would be the judge of that. They definitely did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this place. Two days later and we are still talking about how goodl the food was 
Matt's El Rancho,17,Taking suggestions from people for Austin eats and Matt s El Rancho came up multiple times.  I asked the waiter what he recommended I order if I am from out of town and new to the restaurant - he indicated the Bob Armstrong Dip and Tacos Al Carbon and so I ordered both.  The Bob Armstrong Dip is something that doesn t look like it will be good  but it is.  It is addictingly good - it was like queso with a taco meat dollop.  Hard to explain imagine but trust me  order this.  The Tacos Al Carbon were tortillas with melted cheese topped with peppers and steak.  The meat was so tender and delicious and the cheese was to die for.  My mouth is literally watering reminiciing this dish.  Excellent job Matt s 
Matt's El Rancho,18,Heads up  for large groups they do not take reservations and they will only seat you if the entire party is there. They have both indoor and outdoor seating available - plus it s a large restaurant so plenty of seating.   We had our team lunch here and we made sure we all had to try the queso  We got a couple of the Chile Con Queso  Bob Armstrong Dip  and Guacamole. All were so so good  but make sure to eat them ASAP before they get cold and super thick. For my entree  I got the beef fajita plate and I would rate it a 4 5. The portion of the beef was 85  and fajitas was 15  so wish there was a bit more fajitas. Otherwise  I really enjoyed mixing in the lettuce  pico de gallo  and sour cream with the beef fajitas. The beans and rice were okay and I skipped on using the tortilla wraps. Definitely would come back just for the appetizer cheese dishes - yum 
Matt's El Rancho,19,HUGE restaurant that was recommended to me by a local. This restaurant has been in Business for over 70 years     We came for a Sunday dinner with no reservation around 6 15pm. It was PACKED. The hostess said the wait would be about 30 min  but it ended up being only 15. Their most famous drink is their Mexican martini  the knockout   which was literally 4 drinks in 1. It tasted like a very good skinny Margarita  served in a martini glass and with olives as a garnish.  Their bob armstring queso was amazing. The menu is huge  but their asaderos tacos were listed as the  best tasting 120 taco you will ever have   so I tried it. You get two tacos and a side of pinto beans. The beef is so thick that they give you two corn tortillas per taco  It s topped with onions and peppers and has baked cheese as a base. I will admit that I m not a huge steak taco person  so I didn t love the tacos. I felt that they were too chewy for my liking. But  if you like steak tacos  then these were great.  Absolutely stuffed  we finished with their tres leches cake  my personal fave   and it was very light but so good. I can see why this is a staple restaurant here 
Matt's El Rancho,20,A legend amongst the Austin area. I highly recommend going with 2 friends. Each order crispy tacos.   One person get beef.  One chicken.  One shrimp.   Then everyone do the ol switcheroo and try one of each.   And oh yea. Margaritas     
Matt's El Rancho,21,I have found my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin  TX  HANDS DOWN  From the service to the ambiance  and then especially the food  this establishment is a MUST VISIT  I visited a few times before leaving this review to make sure that the experience was consistent. And now I will put my name on this  saying this is one you will enjoy. It is a very crowded place  but for good reason. The chips and salsa are delectable and the entr es are superb. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food  I highly recommend that you give this place a try. We are certainly glad that we did.
Matt's El Rancho,22,I have always heard mixed reviews about this place  with the needle pointing more towards the negative  so despite living in Austin on off since 2008 I had never dined here. I finally decided to see what the hype was wasn t and I was very surprised at how much I liked it  We arrived on a Wednesday around 7 30 to a packed restaurant  We wanted to dine outside and the wait was only 30 minutes. The patio is large and very cute. As soon as we were seated  we received chips and their salsa  which was fire  The queso  minus the meat  was good as was the guacamole. For our mains  we chose the veggie and shrimp enchiladas and the asadero tacos and all dishes were very good. The drinks are damn strong  but delicious  I will definitely come back 
Matt's El Rancho,23,Overall good place for their chips and the table seemed to enjoy their drinks.   Otherwise food was too salty and would not return. At the table we had their queso  guacamole  taco salad  tacos  steak plate.   They are quite large and busy so understandably service is very slow. Food came out at varying random times.   Very large parking lot in the back so you never have to worry about parking.
Matt's El Rancho,24,Bustling popular landmark spot that was crazy crowded when I went for dinner recently on a Friday night. Walked in at 7 30 pm and was told that there would be an hour wait for a table but seeing how well an oil machine was in place figured it would be sooner and so went to their tiny bar for a margarita  strawberry  that was excellent.  Within a half an hour was called to my table outside. Table was a little uncomfortable since it was outside table furniture and chairs but regardless ordered a second margarita  which was not so good this time . Had chips and salsa which were amongst the best I ever had. Since I love Mexican food and it s so lousy in South Florida decided to go overboard. Had the cheese enchiladas which was somewhat disappointing and served cold in the middle.  I would rate that 3 out of 5 for someone that is addicted to them. Then had their Old Fashioned beef tacos that were  to die for .  All in all I would rate this place 3.5 stars out of 5 and would like to try other Mexican restaurants here in Austin before returning but still this place was  kinda  good.
Matt's El Rancho,25,LOVE LOVELOVED it dining at Matt s El Rancho    The BEST Mexican  NOT TEX MEX    that I have had in Austin  imo   sorry but when I want Mexican food this is what I crave  sorry Texas     We started with the Burnt Orange Margarita   tasty however it could have been served colder  a few ice cubes fixed that  and the guacamole   was delicious and the chips were nice  thin  amp  served warm YUMMMMMO      Our first time here we order what we ALWAYS order figuring if this is good the next visit we would explore the different options on the menu. Classic combination plate crispy beef taco  still making my mouth  water  plus cheese enchilada rice  amp  beans. Both plates were cleaned like we hadn t eaten in days      Matt s is a huge restaurant and very nicely decorated  amp  laid out. Our server  Grace was lovely allowing tine for us to order then enjoy our cocktails chips  amp  guac 
Matt's El Rancho,26,I have been to Matts El Rancho  more than any other restaurant in Austin. I think that speaks for itself. It s my go-to place for dinner. The food never disappoints. The service is always consistent. Always be aware that there will always be a wait no matter what. But the wait is always worth it. My favorite things on the menu are their Flautas  queso  taco salad with beed fajita meat  and fajitas. Matts El Rancho...I love you    Pros  food  service  price  drinks  atmosphere   Cons  long wait  they honestly need to open a second location for how long the wait is and how popular it is 
Matt's El Rancho,27,Came with a few friends from Los Angeles  Best queso I ve ever had  Great service and reasonable prices. Glad we got to try some great Tex Mex   I liked the Deluxe Dinner--delicious and I got to try a little of everything
Matt's El Rancho,28,Had this the other day and wasn t very impressed. We got the asadero tacos that were getting a lot of hype  quesadillas  and the queso.  The taco fell a bit flat for me. The fried cheese didn t really add much and the meat was a bit tough and chewy.  Did enjoy the queso but probably won t be eating here again.
Matt's El Rancho,29,Food  5 5  Service  4 5  Environment  4 5
Matt's El Rancho,30,Puh-lease  This place is GREAT. I go all the time so this is the first review of many. This place is a great vibe. Go with friends and family and you will have a blast. It s typically pretty packed in the evenings and they do not take reservations so just be prepared. We usually get a drink at the bar and chill as we wait. This is a MUST TRY if you are a true Austinite   My recommendations   - If you go it is required that you get a Bob dip for the table. It s heaven on earth.  - I also suggest the fajitas they are phenomenal.  - For those of age  try a Knockout Martini. It s a Matt s classic.
Matt's El Rancho,31,The reviews told me what to expect  a loud place with some hit or miss food and great drinks. That s about right. Others complained about the wait but at 7 pm on a Monday night they told us 20 minutes and it was 5.  I ordered Victoria beer in a bottle which you can t get anywhere but Texas and Mexico. I was really happy to see it on the menu along with Sol. People were definitely getting their drink on here. Trays of shots for dudes in their 30 s were coming out regularly.   Server brought the oversized chips and salsa and we ordered the Queso dip without the meat and guacamole. Queso is as others described--processed cheez whiz. It wasn t think though which would have helped.   My companion ordered the asadero tacos and I had the Matt s special. I didn t eat the refried beans or rice  but the enchiladas were good. What the server brought as a taco was more of a tostada  on top of hard shell  and covered in iceberg lettuce. I didn t find it appetizing. The  guacamole salad that came with my companion s meal also looked unappetizing. Plating really makes a difference  although she was very happy with her tacos.  Service was attentive  unlike other reviews  although I was surprised when he told me they didn t take Amx. No signs anywhere. Good thing I had another card   This place did not fulfill my desire for good Tex-Mex food  but I m guessing people who go there wouldn t really know the difference because it seemed like most were concentrating on drinking and not the food experience. Not a criticism  just an observation.
Matt's El Rancho,32,In the area for short vacation trip  to catch up with friends and looking for lunch on this day.. Matt s was in the prime location. Walked in and was greeted promptly.   Ordered with Jorge and waited while it was made fresh. The order was delivered in a timely manner and all flavors were delicious. The combo cheese dip was decadent    The lobby was clean as were the restrooms. The cost was reasonable and the food was piping hot. I had a chicken tacos platter - it hit the spot....Its a pretty good location and I will return when in the area. Thank you team  amp    Jorge   for being patient as I scrolled the menu multiple time before deciding and for getting the kids plate out first.. the chips and salsa - so TASTY     Team should be commended  Respectfully  Bryan OKC We need a Matt s in our area     Justsayin 
Matt's El Rancho,33,Who doesn t love Matt s   I can t think of a single person. It s the place everyone always wants to go for Tex Mex in Austin. It s the place that accommodates large parties and the place to celebrate the good things in life. We recently got together with some family and of course met at Matt s. The drinks were flowing and the chips and queso were disappearing. I personally love the Prickly Pair Margarita. This visit I ordered the Chile Relleno stuffed with cheese  I love a good Chile Relleno. It s like comfort food. I haven t had a bad thing on the menu here. There is usually a wait but it goes quick. The one thing that is hard for here at times is the noise level. It gets super loud in the restaurant and is hard to hear across tables. Even with that said Matt s is always a blast and a place the locals and visitors love 
Matt's El Rancho,34,The good  Ample parking Pleasing atmosphere.  Lots of light. Helpful friendly staff Spinach poblanitas were good  The not so good  Parking spaces are very very narrow. Be skinny and flexible to get out of your car  Chips were terrible. No taste. Thick. The taco was actually a tostada on same  chip  Paper Menu item description very tiny font. Be under 40 or use the online menu Matt s special was just okay House margarita in small wine glass over  9  General impression- Okay food with one entree good and one middlin to average. Nice people. Clean place. No hard feelings. No need to visit again
Matt's El Rancho,35,Guys  try the chicken fried steak here. It was surprisingly AWESOME. The chips and salsa was also great.
Matt's El Rancho,36,SOO GOOD    Flavors and vibe really being this place together. It s definitely on the  spicy  end but I am weak so who know  Staff was so nice and very easy to work with. All of our food was on time and tastes so good. My biggest issue was the portions. All of the apps and entrees fell short for sure and the price is on the higher end. This place is a must try in Austin   
Matt's El Rancho,37,I used to live off of Lamar and Bluebonnet back in 2005  right around the Marias Taco Express v Walgreens fiasco. I remember thinking about Matt s as we pondered how many more our beloved institutions would get torn down and replaced by condos or some other useless business.  After all  Matt s was in their 50s and I wondered if they d survive the ever-changing world around them and Lamar. Heck  how much longer would I last in the town I d grown to call home  I wondered.   Well  fast forward to 2022. Both Matt s and I are older  grayer and much more set in our ways. They re in their 70s now and I m comfortably entering my mid-40s.   The property is immaculate  as always. That in itself is a sight to be experienced and appreciated. I can t stress that enough.  The margaritas were pretty good  no complaints there and our server was exceptional. Even though we seemed to be sitting at the back of the outside patio  almost beyond the wall  she managed to keep checking on us with decent regularity. The number of humans needed to make this operation work effectively  day in and day out  would make your head explode. You have to appreciate that.  Listen  I know I m a Mexican food snob and I sometimes find Tex-Mex to be of lesser standing but when you know what you re in for  you have to grade it on that curve. As such  the carne guisada was good  as were my wive s asadero tacos.   Now here s where they get four stars. I can t stress this enough  the tortillas are crucial people. You can t skimp on that. The corn tortillas were paper thin  flavorless and overall just bland. Had they been the nice and thick variety  homemade as those at Casa Gs or other places that appreciate the value of a tortilla you can be proud of  they would ve received a healthy five stars. But alas  I can t  in good faith  do that.  That said  while a little pricey for the offering  I understand you gotta pay maintain that staff of 60  and that beautiful property  I still recommend Matt s. It s an Austin institution and a worthwhile experience.
Matt's El Rancho,38,Was told the wait would be an hour and 1 2 then I got a text saying the table was ready so I told the hostess and she said  I told you an hour and a half it s only been 57 minutes  which was sassy and then I got another text 5 min later saying it was still ready so I asked a different girly and she lead us to the table. Deff get the knock out martini it will do the trick. For enchiladas ask for both squares and mix them
Matt's El Rancho,39,Your traditional Tex Mex.   Stopped in midweek without a reservation and was glad to get a table without a wait. The parking lot was packed by the time we left  so anticipate a wait on the weekend.   The queso was the best part is the meal but the chips were over fried. The burrito was average as well.
Matt's El Rancho,40,As a Californian trying tex mex for the first time I had really high hopes  After hearing a lot about Matt s El Rancho  we decided to give it a try. Here s what we got   El Rancho Skinny Margarita - really good  All the margs here are good and definitely worth it  Bob Armstrong Dip  no meat  - basically queso with beans and guac  it was good but basically just tasted like chunky queso. Couldn t really taste the guac because they put like a really tiny amount in a big bowl of queso. I will say though that I really liked the chips  They were thin and crispy and they kept them refilled through the duration of our meal.  Spinach Poblanitas Enchiladas - I decided to go with the vegetarian enchiladas. I wasn t a fan of these. Though the filling tasted really good  the outer tortilla was really tough and the suiza sauce was bland. It basically tasted like just sour cream on the outside and I wasn t a fan. I would recommend going verde instead if you decide to get these and ask for them extra hot. My assumption is the tortilla was tough because they just weren t warm enough.   Overall  this place was ok. For apps and drinks it s pretty good but the entrees are pretty average and overpriced.
Matt's El Rancho,41,Honestly pleasantly surprised  Can t wait to come back and try their fajitas    Chicken fajitas quesadillas were so good    The chicken had so much flavor and was so tender. And it had veggies which was a plus      Tamales were on the drier side  so pass on that.
Matt's El Rancho,42,My favorite tex mex restaurant. They grind their own corn and great chips from that. Everything good after 2 00pm. The enchilada sauce is cloudy prior to 2 00pm and it makes a huge difference in taste. Great tex mex spot and an icon in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,43,We went here for lunch and we loved it  Tons of seating and a great outdoor vibe. The service was great and the food was delicious. The margaritas were also delicious. The menu has a nice variety of dishes. Would definitely recommend if you re looking for a more casual meal in Austin. Great for bigger groups or families as well.
Matt's El Rancho,44,A wedding party of around 25 people visited Matt s El Rancho for dinner on a Saturday night around 6 30pm. To me  that was a big mistake  but Matt s agreed to seat us.   We were told they could accommodate us in 2-2.5 hours  so we drank at the bar until closer to the time. As it got closer  we had multiple rounds of the hostess telling us table s  were available  us trying to round up the group and then it becoming unavailable. By the time 9pm rolled around  they sat half of us and 10 minutes later sat the other half in another room. I think they tried to get us altogether  but the hostess was not friendly and it was just a sh-t show.   The knockout martini is a good price for what you get. We shared the Bob Armstrong dip  and I ordered the fish tacos and subbed for redfish. Food was decent  but nothing absolutely different than elsewhere I d say. I think this restaurant is overhyped  but it was definitely affordable so I would still recommend coming as a casual Tex-Mexican restaurant.   Wish I could rate 3.5 stars  but I am putting 3 instead of 4.
Matt's El Rancho,45,I mean if it s on the 120 tacos to eat before you die list I have to try it. Great tacos  great taco shells  and super service. Our waiter was so nice it was like talking to someone I ve known for a while  The margs were cold  refreshing  and strong. Queso was good served with warm halved tortillas. What a fun place for drinks and food 
Matt's El Rancho,46,Very good fajitas  the beef and cheese and guacamole dip was very good. Huge amounts of seating. Good service
Matt's El Rancho,47,Absolutely loved our meal at Matt s El Rancho. Ordered the asadero tacos and Bob Armstrong dip  both of which were excellent. It was nice to sit outside and watch birds bathe in the fountain to cool off. Be careful  The margs are strong and can definitely sneak up on you. 10 10
Matt's El Rancho,48,I don t care how long you have to wait to get a table  or that they don t take reservations. I fucking love this place. And it s not even somewhere you HAVE TO TRY - the food isn t even particularly unique. Matt s just has inexplicably good vibes. There s a sense of camaraderie among everyone who s dining here together. Everyone s at least one knock out martini deep  not a single care in the world. And it s lovely.  TL DR... if you get it you get it
Matt's El Rancho,49,Don t get me wrong  I LOVE Matt s El Rancho but it is just so hard to get a table at any normal dining time so I m knocking down my rating based on that. The restaurant is an Austin staple so  despite the fact that the restaurant is busy  it is always packed. If you re down to power through the wait  be sure to grab a margarita to make the time go by a bit faster. My favorite is the frozen prickly pear margarita. Once you re seated  you re missing out if you don t order the Bob Armstrong Dip  it s definitely high on the list for queso in Austin in my opinion.   COVID Precautions  Minimal due to lowering case numbers.
Matt's El Rancho,50,The food was absolutely delicious  their frozen marg was quite tasty as well. But the best part of this experience was the service  I have never had better service before coming here  our waitress Vanessa was so attentive and friendly  I was blown away  10 10 recommend for an awesome time 
Matt's El Rancho,51,The food is solid. Great lunch menu and definitely near the front of the pack in a crowded field overall. The service can be spotty though  especially at the bar. It s 11 40am on a Wednesday as I write this and it s taken 20 minutes for the bartender to bring me chips and salsa. I don t expect to be doted on  and it does get busy here  but it s empty right now and it s not that much to ask for chips and salsa.  My food came out quick  and it s damn good  but the bartender never checked in to confirm that fact. I ll definitely be back because it s close  but this gal isn t getting more than 10 .
Matt's El Rancho,52,Matt s is it   Yup it s just where you go for good food and a great atmosphere. Love this austin staple
Matt's El Rancho,53,We are from L.A  wanted to try a Tex- Mex Food and we were recommended to this spot because of their famous Chile relleno   I can say their food was delicious  servers very courteous  place was overall pleasant. My daughter looked outside and realized there was a water fountain so we stepped outside and saw the nice outdoor area  too bad we weren t sit out in that area.
Matt's El Rancho,54,There are several quality Tex Mex establishments in and all around Austin.  The line of people waiting for a table was so long on a Friday night that we made it a point to return the following night earlier   5 00 pm  when the wait was manageable.  Was told the wait would be 45 minutes but ended up being closer to 30 minutes.  Our party of 9 enjoyed each and every entree we ordered.  From the tortilla chips  salsa  margaritas  and the various menu choices  this establishment will not disappoint you.  Our server Ed was top notch.  My carnitas entree was most flavorful and delicious. If you have a group of 4-10 or more I highly recommend this restaurant.
Matt's El Rancho,55,I am updating and removing a star.   I will continue to come here but my disappointment grows.   I have mainly done pick up due to How busy they are and covid. More times than not they are on time but it is hit or miss.   This go around when i ordered queso  the container was barely filled. And other items were sloppily put together. Honestly it was just a big let down.   I still think the food is very good. But the quality within delivery continues to fall short.
Matt's El Rancho,56,Matts El Ranch is an Austin staple.   When someone comes to town and wants to know where to eat good tex mex this is where I send them.   The food is great  the drinks are great. The service is great.   I love that some of the meals come with complimentary pecan pralines.   My favorite thing here is the Bob Armstrong Dip  its basically a queso compuesto but theres just something about their cheese  that makes it extra special.   They also have to die for Mexican Martinis and hella good margaritas.   I m giving them an easy two thumbs up. Make the trip to Matts you wont regret it.
Matt's El Rancho,57,This place is a hoot and a half. Feels like a Mexican resort and is huuuuuuge  Room after room after room. Came here with a party of 10-12 and the service was incredible  10 10.  The food is pretty good  not insane. But the atmosphere is so fun. It can get pretty loud here so would avoid for a date.
Matt's El Rancho,58,Well  I don t know who Bob Armstrong is was. But his namesake dip is FANTASTIC    As was Christina  our waitress.   Great first experience here. Not a local  but will definitely return 
Matt's El Rancho,59,Food is amazing. I m from out of town and can honestly say this place rocks.  I will be back   
Matt's El Rancho,60,This is a big restaurant with several dining areas and a wonderful Patio. The service was prompt and excellent. The food is very good and the menu extensive. There is also a very good bar.  Matt s is an Austin restaurant that should be visited by all when visiting in town or living here 
Matt's El Rancho,61,Bob Armstrong Dip was worth it and also a perfect starter for our dinner. Our dinner would have not been possible without the hostess Riley  she was the sweetest  most professional and incredibly helpful person at the restaurant. On a busy Sunday she found a great spot and was super professional  RILEY SHOULD GET A RAISE  
Matt's El Rancho,62,Make sure to get there early to put your name on the waitlist.  Good service. Great tacos  Spicy Marg was just alright. But the fish tacos were delicious just out of sliced avocado.
Matt's El Rancho,63,FINALLY ... found great Mexican Food in Austin.  Everything about Matt s is  Always Good .  Their Mexican Martinis were on point.  The vibe is great 
Matt's El Rancho,64,A really big Tex mex restaurant. The space at Matt s El Rancho is probably one of the biggest restaurants I ve experienced in Austin.   We got a table for 2 on a busy Saturday night. There was a 30 min wait  and we were eventually seated outside by the koi pond. The service was slow and the restaurant seemed understaffed.   It took a while for my drinks to come  and even longer before the waiter could come back around to put in our food order. The dip came quickly  but the food did not.   The food was good. It s tex mex  so it s hard to dislike haha. But I don t think I will be coming back because I think there are other tex mex restaurants in Austin with faster service
Matt's El Rancho,65,Had take out here at least 6 times over the last two years. Came here in person for the first time in a while today. Had to wait five minutes to get a menu. Hostess should give menus out when they seat you. Silly to have to wait 
Matt's El Rancho,66,A rip-off. They screw you on sizes ... and charge     . Terrible service. Don t recommend this restaurant at ALL.
Matt's El Rancho,67,Before Austin skewered the weird label by making it a slogan.  Before Austin was really weird  but didn t  know it.  There was Matt s.  Still good.  Still reliable.  Just more crowded and pricey  for Tex Mex  at least.  Great drinks.  Great atmosphere.  Great service.  The standard fair is  we ll ... standard.  Good by Austin Tex Mex standards but not uncommon.  The standouts   the Bob Armstrong dip  tacos al carbon  and  asadero tacos.   Always happy to drop into Matt s  if the wait does not exceed my appetite.
Matt's El Rancho,68,had dinner here other night with wife and son and girlfriend...very busy..seems like every night..food was very good..prices very reasonable..restaurant workers were very helpful and professional..thanks for a great meal
Matt's El Rancho,69,It s Matt s El Rancho  A staple in Austin for decades  Matt s is a solid spot for Tex-Mex. It s not the best  it s not the worst  it is dependable. Great margs and queso. Awesome service. Good for groups. Plenty of parking.
Matt's El Rancho,70,Wow  Matt s El Rancho has the second worst Tex Mex I ve ever had  following a place in literally Connecticut. The salsa to start with was abysmal  with no flavor and a tiny bit of spice. The tortilla chips were each the size of my hand and unsalted  so I had to break each one to a reasonable size to eat. I ordered the veggie enchiladas and my partner ordered the carne asada. I took one bite of the enchiladas and was instantly disappointed by the lack of flavor. The beans and rice did not make up for it either. My partner said the carne asada was alright  but wildly overpriced. As an Austin establishment  you would hope at least the queso was good -- NOPE  I had to add some of the miserable salsa to it for it to have any flavor. My partner did say his paloma was good and strong - I guess drinks are the main reason people visit Matt s because I simply cannot find another reason. It is SO BAD  I want to give it a zero  but that s not possible  so I ll give it a one. Will not be returning and will not be recommending. If you like flavor  spend your money elsewhere 
Matt's El Rancho,71,Passed by on a Thursday night with at least 50 people waiting outside so decided must be great lets try  Since ive gone vegetarian  Mexican restaurants are not my favorite to go to due to VERY limited options and this place was no exception. I got a spinach mushroom enchilada which i forced myself to eat. It wasnt really bad but it wasnt good either. The tortillas not my favorite. Our server was extremely lovely and even offered and changed my food for me. Plenty of space  outdoor too which is nice for friends to go maybe for margaritas or something. Overall i wouldnt recommend it for vegetarians but dont have a comment for others.
Matt's El Rancho,72,great cheese dip and great service. Jackson with the mustache was an amazing server that helped all of us pick food  courteous of dietary restrictions   We come back every time we are in Austin 
Matt's El Rancho,73,Matt s El Rancho gets a lot of hype which I can see why. Sitting on the back patio is an atmosphere unlike any other  however  the countless flies made for a unique experience. The steak fajitas were a hit  the flies would say so too
Matt's El Rancho,74,Amazing service and food. Good for large parties and they have a kids menu  The margaritas are the best  Great patio seating if you like eating outside 
Matt's El Rancho,75,Welllll  they certainly build up the expectation with their signage.... I ordered the special Asadero taco they glorified on the menu. Hubby had the brisket tacos.  I was sadly disappointed by the experience. The patio is amazing and I will pump that wholeheartedly - great outdoor seating   And I will say the nachos were fabulous- think they were homemade   But what they charge and how much they build up their   award winning  specialty taco  was extremely disappointing. The meat was chewy and had SO Little flavor  . The beans that come with it were flavorless. Except for the chewy meat that I literally spat out gross but true  the ingredients were of good quality. And I just think if someone had paid attention  the meat would have eventually been tender.  The staff was plentiful but just didn t provide the service you would have expected for some many staff to be present. The brisket in my hubby s taco was tasty and the size was good. Both dishes were fairly costly. I d def pay what he did for hubby s but I wouldn t pay  5 for what I was served. It s a great location  great outdoor seating and I wish I good do more for a better review but I can t sadly.
Matt's El Rancho,76,Matt s has been around a very long time. It s popularity is obvious from the crowds. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I have not had a bad meal here. I don t really have a favorite. The patio is very nice  the interior can be a bit noisy. I recommend giving it a try.
Matt's El Rancho,77,Go for the patio and location  not the food. Many people swear by this restaurant but I have never been impressed. The Bob queso congeals within minutes  and tastes terrible once cold. The chips are novel for how big they are  but otherwise unremarkable. Mostly when people say they want to go to Matt s it s because they want to get drunk on the Mexican martinis. So for that  sure  otherwise  no. The parking lot has enough parking  but the spaces are ill designed and people drive dangerously throughout. It s also a pain trying to exit directly onto S. Lamar  particularly right on that bend in the road. Inside it gets packed and incredibly loud with people waiting to be seated or crammed together at the bar. Not covid cautious by any means. With all the offerings in Austin you could do a lot better than Matt s.
Matt's El Rancho,78,Oh my gosh this was the best Mexican food I ve had in a long time.   The service was great. Our waitress was wonderful.   The chips and salsa are to die for. I could have just had that for my meal.   I had beef Al carbon with rice and a cheese puff. It was so good I had the lunch portion and I couldn t even finish it. The plates are well portioned. We had plenty to take home for the next day.   I would recommend sitting outside. It was so nice. I loved the patio atmosphere. The weather was perfect.
Matt's El Rancho,79,Paul  I found a photo of your sign. On Saturday there was a half dozen or more people standing at the hostess station - which blocked your sign. One of your hostess could have pointed to the sign when we initially checked in but instead they told us 6 people needed to be present. I m not going to continue to go back and forth but if your sign is so important  display it in front of the hostess stand. I am sure my family and me not returning to Matt s will be no loss to your business.
Matt's El Rancho,80,From the time we walked into this place  we knew that we were in for a treat. The restaurant itself is stunningly gorgeous as are the friendly staff and the utterly delicious food and drinks. Their queso is without any doubt the best ever. Their salsa is fresh and spicy  and their house made chips are sturdy enough for both.  Without question  this is definitely our new favorite for Tex-Mex.
Matt's El Rancho,81,Somehow walked right on in on a Sunday late afternoon...score  First time here and will come back - mainly because our service was wonderful. Very attentive. My chips and salsa were never empty  food came out quickly  drinks were always filled  etc. The food was good  Not the best mexican food I have ever had but yummy for sure  Will come back 
Matt's El Rancho,82,So annoying they do not do split checks so if you have a big birthday or any big party it leaves everyone to calculate at the end. It was so bothersome and way more work for customers paying Money and Servers   Won t be coming back anytime soon.   Did not use to be that way 
Matt's El Rancho,83,It was very crowded  We sat at the bar and the bartender was great. I don t understand why the bragging about the queso  it was pretty terrible. Better if you mix it with the guacamole or salsa. Check out the picture- it s basically velvetta. Chips were ok  nothing to rave about and lots were too small to dip. The guacamole was delicious and had lots of big chunks of avocado  that apparently is a negative for some but I liked it  .
Matt's El Rancho,84,Very good food but wait times are crazy long  We actually left to go to a bar down the road while we waited for an hour and a half  The Asadero tacos were excellent  
Matt's El Rancho,85,This place was so disappointing. Our group was recommended this place through the grapevine so we figured it was time to give it a try. We went in a group of 4 and got some drinks  apps  and dinner. The asadero tacos are listed as  a taco you have to try before you die  and let me tell you... local food trucks have better and you could probably make tastier ones in your own kitchen. The deluxe dinner was just as tasteless and really just refried beans. Bob Armstrong dip was actually decent.
Matt's El Rancho,86,What s not to like  Been coming to Matt s since childhood. Old school  no compromises Tex-Mex. It s just as good now as it was then. Not hip  not trendy  decidedly Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,87,I love Matt s. Always the best service  managers  staff  food and drinks      Highly recommend 
Matt's El Rancho,88,We love Matt s   Wonderful flavors  scenery  and staff  My husband and I love their margaritas and queso and I m a huge fan of their enchiladas  Even though it always looks super crowded  we ve never had to wait too long as the restaurant is so big 
Matt's El Rancho,89,Finally made it here   Matt s is a  must try  if you re going to be an Austinite. I ve lived here since  92  and finally made it. Great atmosphere- this place has been here a long time  since 1952 . You can feel the nostalgia in the architecture and the decor. I love a place with a rich history. It was packed for lunch with a 1 2 hour wait the day I went. I d recommend an early lunch or dinner to get ahead of the crowd.  The chips are fresh and the salsa is flavorful without being too hot. The menu has lots of great food and drink options. My  go to  Mexican dish is usually verde chicken enchiladas  but I tried the el pastor tacos at Matt s. They were  okay -maybe too much seasoning for my liking. My date and I shared a Matt s Mexican Martini which was perfect  not something I would recommend if you ve got a Zoom call right after drinking .  All in all  Matt s is an experience- I m all about the  experience  of dining out. It has to hit all the right buttons- service  atmosphere  good food and drink  and clean. I ll be back to try my  go to  dish. I hope you ll give this iconic place a try too.
Matt's El Rancho,90,Honestly Matt s handled our large group like a bunch of champs  I m fully aware that having a group of 20ish people can be overwhelming but they did such a good job. The Bob Armstrong dip was killer as always and the fajitas absolutely slapped. There s a reason why I always have to come here every time I m in Austin     Major shoutout to Matt s   
Matt's El Rancho,91,Really good food. Great drinks. Our waiter was very attentive and brought everything we needed quickly on such a busy night. The outdoor patio is pretty and has an enormous fountain that is really lovely to sit near. I recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good food  good service  and pretty scenery.
Matt's El Rancho,92,I called to place a carry out order and was told I am only able to order carry out online. I then explained that online I was unable to do any substitutions and was asked cut off and asked rudely my name and phone number to begin a carry out order. When I wanted to substitute fries for rice with my cheese enchilada dinner I was told  the manager said we aren t able to do substitutions because of the price difference . Which I am aware of and have paid. I ve literally ordered this exact meal in the restaurant several times and there are pictures on Yelp of cheese enchiladas with fries. It s sad that such a small request was rudely declined. There are much better places that are more accommodating in Austin  don t waste your time.
Matt's El Rancho,93,I always love coming to Matt s el rancho. The service  amp  food is great. Always consistent 
Matt's El Rancho,94,Around 6 00p  it was a 20minute wait so we got a margarita - it was good  but  a bit too tart sweet. Food was good and we didn t take a long time to come out  but I think it may be a one and done for us.
Matt's El Rancho,95,Really disappointing experience. Had never been here and always heard amazing things. Found myself right next door so I ducked in for a very late lunch.  I was seated in the back corner - a table between the employee computer system and the bussing station. I never complain but there were a ton of other tables open in the room so I politely asked if I could move to a table near the window or in the open area. The host mumbled something about how this was the only table and I just went along not wanting to make trouble. My server was nice and efficient. Bob Armstrong dip delicious. Soon I was the only table in the area  but since the employee ticket station was literally a few feet in front of my against the wall and everyone was wrapping up their lunch tickets  there were tons of servers and bussers milling around discussing their shifts waiting for the machine right in front of me. It was so awkward and just a really unpleasant experience. A man walked by and asked if all was OK and I politely mentioned that the table was really not the best and I had asked to be seated elsewhere. He said  yes this table is terrible. They do that since they have sections. Next time ask for a manager.  I explained that I understood sections but didn t want to make an ordeal calling over a manager before being seated. The whole experience was incredibly disappointing  and I m never one to complain at restaurants. On top of all this the fish tacos were 95  tortilla with just a few tiny pieces of fish. I left  50 later feeling like I just got scammed but it was my fault for being too polite about it.
Matt's El Rancho,96,Waiter forgot to tell me the fajitas plate was hot. Very similar to how my ex wife forgot to tell me she was sleeping with my dad. Anyways the beef was great  but the Dr. Pepper was better
Matt's El Rancho,97,Kinda disappointed with the hostesses and the food. The hostesses were  choosy  who they should sit first and not friendly. If you re looking for a good Mexican food eats  it s sub par and not the place for it. Taco meats are dry and bland. Although  the chips were great. Our server was good and food came out timely.
Matt's El Rancho,98,Ordinarily  I try and go somewhere twice before reviewing  but I m only in town a week for a work conference and won t be back. To be honest  probably wouldn t go back anyway.   Came here with a large group of coworkers attending the conference. For a large party  we were seated faster than we expected  which was nice.   I ordered the chicken fajitas  because I heard they were known for their fajitas. I ll be honest  there was some  sticker shock  when I first saw the price  but I immediately figured that meant the portion must be HUGE.   BOY. WAS. I. WRONG.   What came to the table was no where near worth the price. No way. And  the fajitas weren t any better than any I ve had anywhere else. Disappointing. I left still hungry.   The only thing I appreciated was the service. Boy our server was FANTASTIC  especially considering the large group.   Apparently  this place is a big deal  but it wasn t for me. Do yourself a favor  if you do go here  pass on the fajitas.
Matt's El Rancho,99,No wait  excellent service  great food and drinks.  Had the chicken flautas and Carne guisada. Both were great.  Rancho margs were perfect.  Parking was a nightmare but they try.
Matt's El Rancho,100,I usually love Matt s. I ordered to go while dining in. I was instructed to order my to go order from the host stand. I did . The manager told the Hostess to give me a big chips and salsa to go since I was dining in. I went to get my   20  to go burrito and there was one 2 oz. salsa and no chips . I asked for the chips and was told it only comes with the 2 oz. I reminded her I was told I could get more chips since i dined in. She then left and came back  and was given chips and another salsa . When I got home I realized there was no ranchero sauce on the side as specified and listed on the receipt and the burrito was rather pathetic looking. Highly disappointed considering how much I go to Matt s and typically enjoy the food and service.
Matt's El Rancho,101,Had such a good time with my husband here  Waited at the bar for 5 star margaritas and then enjoyed wonderful cuisine  Would recommend 
Matt's El Rancho,102,Matt s is a good dependable go-to spot for Tex Mex  drinks  and a little ambiance. Every dish on the menu is pretty what you d expect  no frills here. Matt s is all about size. Size of the menu and size of the restaurant. Just about anything you have a hankering for will be on the menu. And you re practically guaranteed minimal wait for the size of their restaurant. We were able to sit on the patio and have a nice dinner next to the fountain. Really enjoyed the ambiance of that patio. We got a pot of queso which was pretty solid. I went with the Matt s special to sample a couple things and enjoyed. Again  nothing I can necessarily bad about this place. But nothing I m going to rave about. Really good service. Worth going to if you want a casual Tex mex meal
Matt's El Rancho,103,Really good food and ambiance.   We put our name in for a 50 minute wait  so decided to run across the street for a quick drink and got a call that our table was ready within 8 minutes  so we had to chug and get back quickly which was kind of annoying.   But once we were seated  five stars  The Bob Armstrong queso was amazing and the chips were hot and yummy. The Knockout Margarita truly will knock you out  so beware  worth it  .
Matt's El Rancho,104,An Austin classic  Gotta always have the Bob s Armstrong dip....in fact it s perfectly acceptable if you come here only for the dip and margs. I had their fish tacos for my main dish  I liked how they grilled the Mahi Mahi. Actually I wish I can just order a dish of their grilled fish and rice. Their tortillas are good  I just wish I can customize them to be crispy. Staff are always nice here  and the place can get busy. Interior is super clean and their aesthetic is perfect for tex mex.
Matt's El Rancho,105,Worth the hype.  Lives up to the hype.  Certain dishes are better then others but boy is this just a staple and go to for anyone who loves Tex Mex.   And if you don t like Tex mex  Matt s will convert you    Disclaimer  if you don t like a Tex Mex and you need conversion in that case see a psychiatrist first because who does that seriously. Even Ted bundy liked Tex mex.    Don t know if that s true but I m sure if you handed him a plate or fajitas or tacos he ll murder it in one sitting.   There s a reason why there s always a gaggle of people waiting outside for their tables and  a reason why the  parking lot is bigger than Lady Bird lake and a reason why it s packed   Here s some reasons    Margaritas  Service is amazing  Festive atmosphere  Plenty of parking  Quality food  Timeless menu  Amazing Bob Armstrong dip  Crispy beef tacos are like crack  All meats are perfection  Fajitas and enchiladas are heaven   This is just a fun  delicious  dope spot for all occasions   Cmon   Just go here man.  - Joe Biden
Matt's El Rancho,106,General Manager is a totally unprofessional  disrespectful to customers  shouts at his staff in front of customers. He used a shoo motion with his hands right in my face  and legit told me while shouting at a staff to take  them  to some table. He was very close to smacking me white his hand in my face and never once ever looked at me. I ve never experienced this in my life.  I m sitting at my table so incredibly upset at this experience and I m reviewing this right now. I spoke to several waiters and apparently this man is verbally abusive to staff and anyone who upsets him in any way.   Matt s needs a new genera manager. Someone doesn t disrespect customers.
Matt's El Rancho,107,Matt s El Rancho is an Austin classic and one of the busiest restaurants in the city for a reason. It s delicious  consistent  and the service is stellar.   Food  The Bob Armstrong dip wins the title of  best queso  in the city in my book. And I ve lived here for over 25 years. Order it. Love it. You won t regret it.   My personal favorite item is the shrimp a la Matt OR the flautas generally  any variety .   Shrimp a la Matt  grilled shrimp served with flautas. Sounds simple enough  but the shrimp are perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned. And the flautas are the perfect accompaniment for the shrimp. One of my all time favorite tex mex dishes. I order it almost every time.   Flautas  They griddle the flautas rather than fry them and cover them with sauce  much like enchiladas but with more texture form the crisping. Highly recommend.   My husband s favorite dish is the old fashioned brisket tacos  which are brisket tacos crisped on the flat top served with onions and cilantro. Delicious and classic Mexican food with that beloved Texas twist of smoked brisket.   Drinks  Matt s has some of the best margaritas in the city. Fresh lime and great balance of tequila and sweetness. Can t go wrong with a Matt s margarita. I frequently get the sangria swirl variety  and it never disappoints.   Ambience  To be quite honest I hate sitting inside. It s incredibly loud and busy. The patio  however  is one of my favorite dining experiences in the city. Casual  lively  and refreshing for an evening of margs and Tex mex.   There s not much I don t like about this place. Except that it s so busy  I suppose  good luck getting a table on a Texas football game day  .   They don t take reservations  so expect to wait around. But head to the bar and order a margarita while you wait for your table 
Matt's El Rancho,108,Have eaten here a dozen times and had a great meal. The chips salsa and Bob Armstrong dip always get the meal started. Quesadillas  green chicken enchiladas  chile rellenos  fajitas  carne guisada -- all are good. Plus margaritas  It s worth the trip from Houston
Matt's El Rancho,109,Matt s is a go to for ambiance and good Tex Mex.  If you have a big group or want cheese goodness... I m this is the right spot for any hour of the day.   They are closed on a certain day and have high wait times  come prepared.
Matt's El Rancho,110,My roomate and I wanted to treat ourselves but are sitting here in shock by how bad this is. It is a popular place somehow  I don t understand how this is still in buisness.  11 queso- 1 3rd full of velvetta.  9 tres leches  tasted like water- like unsweetened cotton. lastly the enchiladas were so dry with no flavor. very upset   
Matt's El Rancho,111,Worst Mexican food in Texas. Hard pass. Take my advice DO NOT waste your money here. Definitely a place for senior citizens who can t taste their food.  How the hell these guys are in business for 70 years is astonishing. I won t be surprised when this place closes down. Told the staff I didn t want to eat my food and they just said sorry and brought me a check. It seems that everyone is writing reviews based on atmosphere so do not be mislead. No taste very bland never again. Adios Matt 
Matt's El Rancho,112,Unbelievably RUDE. I was literally e-mailing some guy Paul about placing a large order  he tells me I have to call the restaurant to place the order. HE said I can t place this order online  when I call to place the order he has a sassy little attitude and tells me I need to place the order online. Maybe he has memory loss  We talked about this not even a week ago. Hopefully his life gets better and won t continue to be a sour puss. I will support a different local restaurant to place my large order. Thanks for letting me know ahead of time before I spent my money here.   
Matt's El Rancho,113,Chips were really hard but Matt s Queso was good.  Enchiladas were not that good and they gave us little bit of fajitas in the fajita plate. Tortillas were great and the margaritas were really good too but I wouldn t come here again.
Matt's El Rancho,114,It was my second choice  but oh was it good    Stared with fantastic homemade corn chips. The crunch and taste were great either salsa  Then a small portion of guacamole and... the Bob Armstrong cheese dip. Lord it was good. I asked who Bob Armstrong was  the story I was told was a land developer and this restaurant was his favorite  so they named it after him  They ve been here a long time   Then for the main event. Two items jumped out  of course good fajitas and Asadero tacos.  I asked if the fajitas were actually marinated and he said they were and they were great. But I did get one of the tacos and they give you some roasted garlic to put in them in the side  Oh utter heaven   While it might of been my second choice because the other was closed. When I m in Austin  I ll be back   
Matt's El Rancho,115,Listen to me right now..... get the Queso      Just do it   Put a little bit of the salsa in the queso   Soooo good   Everything is good 
Matt's El Rancho,116,We returned during a home game and sat in the bar  ask for that -you get seated sooner .  Vanessa was our waitperson and she couldn t have been more professional and friendly.  Ask for her - she is great.  We enjoyed meeting her and she hid a fabulous job 
Matt's El Rancho,117,I m not a huge fan of Tex Mex.  However I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the food and experience at Matt s El Rancho.  When we walked in  it was clean and the quality of the decor and furniture was at a standard above what I was expecting.  They have a huge private parking lot.  There was no wait time for Sunday lunch.    The waitress was friendly and got our order quickly.  We ordered Bob Armstrong queso as our appetizer.  They gave complementary salsa and chips.  The chips were not greasy and the salsa was spicy.  The queso was thick and gooey with sausage and guacamole.  It was very good.  Great complement to the salsa.  For lunch  I got the Asadero tacos and my husband got the green enchiladas.  We were served guacamole on the side.    The asadero tacos were the best   It s like a fajita but with more flavor from the beef and big chunk of cheese.  It s very filling.  I highly recommend it.  The green enchilada was good.  I suggested requesting extra green sauce.  They used chicken breast which is healthy but can be dry.  The sauce helps.  Overall we recommend this place.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests to try Tex Mex.
Matt's El Rancho,118,Absolutely best TexMex in Austin. Prob best in Texas and beyond. Superb salsa and chips  queso  and best chili con carne anywhere.
Matt's El Rancho,119, Covid-19 Review  We decided to head to Matt s for an early dinner. We had both missed lunch so decided that 430 would be a good time-miss the crowd. We made the right choice    The sidewalk was marked every six feet so people could stand while waiting in line- which luckily we didn t have to use since we were hitting the place early  The two young girls greeted us from behind a plexiglass divider and escorted us through to the patio.   We ended up with a perfect table for two right next to the pond   See photo  There were fans  a mister  and a nice breeze  There were no kids running around the patio which is always one of the things I disliked about sitting out there in the past.   We each ordered a Mexican Martini and a small Bob s Armstrong dip. I mean come on....you have to right      side note - years ago on that same patio I was with a girlfriend enjoying a Bob dip when an adorable older gentleman came along and said   I see you have the Bob Armstrong dip. I m Bob Armstrong    He told us all about how it came to be etc. I think we got a photo. I m not sure.  He then made his way around to all of the tables on the patio telling his same tale. He was darling. He has since passed away but I think of that story every time I m there    We ordered Asadero Beef  tenderloin  Tacos and Grilled Fish Tacos. Each dish came with a guacamole salad which is always a nice touch -just a little bit of greens before you stuff your face with more cheese and goodness    The waitstaff all wore masks and were very attentive and polite. It s tough working in the service industry as it is...I can t imagine on a hot Texas day with a mask  Thank you   By the time we left  the line was forming around the building. I m glad we got there early.   I love supporting a local business and Matt s is doing a great job considering all of the changes due to Covid-19. Wear your  mask  
Matt's El Rancho,120,Not impressed. The only thing I would say was a hit was the salsa. We ordered the queso  cheese quesadilla  what was suppose to be a burrito and some enchiladas. None of the dishes looked presentable or had any love put into them.This place seems good for large parties since it has plenty of room but sadly for our party of 5 it just didn t hit the spot.
Matt's El Rancho,121,This will forever be my favorite restaurant in Austin. I come once a week and always enjoy the same things  because when something is so perfect  why mess it up   Knockout Martini   Large Bob   amp  Beef Fajitas.   During COVID  they ve been doing an exceptional job social distancing  keeping to state guidelines  ensuring everyone wears masks  etc.  Also  best of all  they re now open on Tuesday s   Wooo
Matt's El Rancho,122,Always a great time at Matt s  The Bob  Mexican martinis  and asadero tacos are incredible. It s very loud in the restaurant  but if you can get out on the patio  it s peaceful and better for conversation.
Matt's El Rancho,123,If you re new to Matt s El Rancho  and you re currently doing your due diligence by reading through the Yelp reviews  this clearly won t have been the first mention of the stupidly awesome Bob Armstrong dip that you ve read  but trust me when I say that all of that hype is very well-earned  Man  is it good  Queso  ground beef  and guac in one bowl for dipping  Why in the heck not  right    Beyond that  Matt s has my favorite cheese enchiladas of ALL time  Pro Tip  Choose verde for your sauce and order a side of sour cream  The balance is superb    The hubby is a massive fan of the Asadero tacos and the brisket tacos    But the Bob  y all  Run. Don t walk. That is all.
Matt's El Rancho,124,My fiance and I ate here recently and we were very happy with their COVID precautions. Everyone working there kept masks on  tables were nicely spread out  and they were doing everything they could to maintain social distancing while people waited for their table.   Our waiter  so sorry I forget his name   was super friendly and helpful when we asked for suggestions on what to order. When we arrived he brought chips and salsa. Salsa was flavorful with a little bit of spice.  We got the Bob Armstrong queso and it was AMAZING. MUST TRY. I ordered chicken and steak fajitas and there was so much food. The meat was in a seasoning sauce that made them a little unique and I really enjoyed it. My fiance got the asadero tacos  which he enjoyed. Very simple but flavorful.  This is a perfect place to go with friends  have some drinks  eat a lot of food  and not spend a crazy amount of money. It s a good value. Also  LOTS of parking 
Matt's El Rancho,125,7 2020 update   Unfortunately  my experience with pick-up at Matt s has seriously decreased in quality. As an avid supporter of all things local and especially Tex Mex  it disheartens me to say that until COVID is no longer an issue  I will not be ordering takeout or dining in at Matt s. Here s why  1. My food was COLD when I brought it home. I live within one mile of Matt s and picked up exactly on time. It must have been sitting there waiting for me long before I was told it was ready. With so many other pick up options these days  this is inexcusable.  2. My chips were STALE. I LOVE Matt s queso but every last chip in my bag was stale... thankfully I had my own chips at home but imagine how sad I would be if I hadn t.  3. The line out the door is massive and not a single person is being asked to where a mask while out front... Seems very risky at a time like this.   Sorry Matt s El Rancho  maybe I ll dine in once it s safe again but my pick-up orders will be filled elsewhere.
Matt's El Rancho,126,First off I absolutely LOVE this place. My family has been going here for over 20 years. But honestly the to go prices are way off.  Food wise fine  but for to go alcohol drinks.... ridiculous. Paid 14 bucks for the Knockout Martini which we ve gotten there dozens of times but the cup I got was smaller than a kids cup drink. Like it s honestly not even an 8 oz drink. Had I known that the  14 drink I was getting to go was going to be so so small  I wouldn t have bothered.  On their website it does not say how big the drink is. So for perspective I ve added a photo. Honestly it s smaller than the to go margs at Taco Cabana....disappointing that I spent that much for something so small.  OVERALL THEIR FOOD AND RESTAURANT IS AMAZING To go drinks are just ridiculously overpriced for the size you receive. I d have been happy to pay  14 if it was the actual size of the drink I get when I dine in.  Just buy and make your own drinks...don t bother.
Matt's El Rancho,127,Been going to El Rancho for my entire life and it s still amazing. It s classic Tex mex and it s great.   Love them so much they catered both my wedding and my brothers wedding.   Asadero tacos are my favorite.  Always recommend. An Austin staple.
Matt's El Rancho,128,This place was packed and really hopping with customers.  I tried the Shrimp Chile Relleno  and thought it was fine  while not caring for the raisins or nuts too much.  The Deluxe dish wasn t anything to be desired.  They have a very nice fountain patio area if you don t get stuck around the back corner  definitely should remove at least 4 tables   The soppapillas were a nice light dessert.
Matt's El Rancho,129,The food is amazing and the Mexican martinis are chef s kiss   Every time my family comes to town  this is where they want to go first 
Matt's El Rancho,130,Last night was UTTER chaos in Austin  The UT Bama game has stretched the service industry. We waited 3 hours for a table with a large party. You might think I m complaining... but I m not. We KNEW it would be hard but our group wanted to be together and we wanted to be at Matt s. The staff busted their butts all night. I never saw a cross word and they remained calm though the crowds were oppressive and the heat relentless. Our waiter was fabulous getting us fed and taken care of late in the evening when I know he had to be worn out. Thank you Matt s  We made some great memories.  Oh and Love the dip     Roll Tide 
Matt's El Rancho,131,This place is one of the last beacons of old Austin. The day Matt s closes their doors is the day Austin is truly dead.   Wife and I came for dinner after having moved to Cedar Park a few years ago  yay Austin real estate  . It had been easily 3 or 4 years since our last meal at this classic Tex-Mex spot. The chips were just as crunchy as I remember  they are lil thicker than the others   the salsa had the same heat  and the Grilled Old Fashioned Tacos were still on the menu.   Happy to be back  sorry it took so long.
Matt's El Rancho,132,ATX classic   This restaurant has a great outdoor area and really good Tex mex like their amazing brisket tacos BUT... The salsa is spicy and the restaurant can get very busy to the point that we weren t served refills and our food came out cold.  Worth going at-least once and seeing if it s worth the hype. I m optimistic and I ll be back again to see if it redeems itself 
Matt's El Rancho,133,Matt s El Rancho is a definite find  I have heard good things about this place and had to find out for myself... well  I m just going to say the food was amazing  There is just something about walking into a restaurant and being able to see who and how your food is being prepared   The homemade chips and salsa was a great start with guacamole and the the beef enchiladas was perfectly seasoned   It s been around since 1952... and they are waiting on you... get there already 
Matt's El Rancho,134,Have been a regular at Matt s for well over 20 years.   For classic Tex-Mex  Matt s is the top spot in Austin. Traditional Tex-Mex dishes do not disappoint. Amazing iced tea  margaritas  chips  salsa  chili con queso  guacamole  and that tomato vinaigrette    fajitas  enchiladas  nachos  tacos  and Mexican rice and beans.  The staff is all wonderful and hard working and truly care about your dining experience.   They ve done great during the challenges of the COVID-19 era  and are to be commended.   Always leave full  satisfied and happy in the tummy 
Matt's El Rancho,135,For being Tex Mex it was alright. I got my order to go so maybe I missed out on some flavors along the process but it did not amaze me. I was recommended to try the Bob Armstrong Dip and again maybe perhaps I got it to go I did not get the full experience but it wasn t that good. I may give it another try in the future but I wasn t quite impressed.
Matt's El Rancho,136,Okay  I first came here in the 70s when the place was on 1st street with my dad.  Then migrated to S Lamar.  My step mom just passed  and she met us here so many times  so we had to come again for her.  We got a great table in the bar.  Felicia was a wonderful waiter.  It was packed and the bar had several rows of standing people by 7 00.  we had several margaritas which were very good and potent.  Bob Armstrong dip good.  Chips are awful.  Thick heavy huge fried tortillas.  Chips for queso and salsa need to be light.   Place was packed so took extra time to get food.  Used to get Guacamole enchiladas but not offered anymore.  Have not been here in several years.  Menu really scaled back.  And now instead of getting a scoop of sherbet or a praline after your meal  you have to order and they charge.  I guess that the place is still in business with all the changes in Austin is a plus.   Sigh.......
Matt's El Rancho,137,I love this place and have grown up going here. The drinks and food are amazing but the wait time is no joke. I personally think they should go on a reservation system so that people are not waiting 2  hours for a table and things would be much more organized. Overall a cool atmosphere but not the vibe if you are actually hungry.
Matt's El Rancho,138,We went here for lunch and this place feels like a huge cafeteria. I definitely would not bring a date here or do any special occasion here. It s massive  the food is inexpensive  but it s just OK. My steak  amp  cheese tacos were good though.
Matt's El Rancho,139,Matt s El Rancho  the slogan say  Always good  but I disagree with that. It should say  Always great . We are from Fort Worth and this is our favorite Tex Mex place in Texas. Food is awesome. Atmosphere is amazing. The drinks are done well here also  There is long wait on Friday night but we ll worth it.
Matt's El Rancho,140,This place had great reviews a lot of character. It was also packed out the door on the Sunday that we attended. And overall it was good. Our service was good our margaritas were tasty  and we had a good time. I think the Bob Armstrong that is overrated. It s just chile con queso with guacamole  and I actually didn t like it. It gave off kind of a weird smell. I probably would have been more satisfied with regular queso. They were really nice  and they let us get chicken and shrimp fajitas combined even though that s not on the menu normally. They were good fajitas  but not the best I ve ever had. You can see in my pictures that they are pretty greasy. There is an amount of grease that is going to happen automatically but the vegetables seemed like they were swimming  and we had lean meat. Overall it wasn t bad  but not worth the hype To me.
Matt's El Rancho,141,Although this isn t my favorite Tex-Mex in Austin  I keep coming back for two menu items  which pair perfectly with each other  in particular   1  Bob Armstrong 2  Matt s Knockout Martini  The Bob is one of the best queso concoctions I have ever had. I don t know what it is in the secret recipe that makes it so unique and addictive  but it has forced me into breaking every diet I ve ever attempted in all the years that I ve lived in Austin. Add in a Knockout Martini or two  or several  to the mix  and I could hang out at this establishment all day. I have finished entire Bobs by myself and had to take the rest of my dinner to-go on several occasions  without regret .  Combine this with the extraordinary wait staff and hostesses  many of which have been there for over a decade  and this is without a doubt a five star establishment.
Matt's El Rancho,142,Matt s El Rancho has lots of reviews and has been around for many years but I m not sure what the hype is about  honestly. The food was pretty good but more expensive than I had expected. The queso was good but there are places in Austin with better queso. The margaritas are premixed and watery. My beef chile relleno had a unique take with the raisins and pecans. It was something to check off my list  but I probably won t be back.
Matt's El Rancho,143,Solid ranch style food  great chips. Busy  amp  loud  a family place...
Matt's El Rancho,144,I ve been going to Matt s for 30 years  and it s great every time. Austin now has so many trendy  hot-spots  and shiny new places to eat  which are fine as well  but Matt s is an old Austin original which more than holds its own.
Matt's El Rancho,145,It was a Tuesday night and my friend wanted to take me to his favorite Mexican restaurant  insert Matt s El Rancho  We came here around 8PM and the place was absolutely packed. This large establishment has a ton of seating and thanks to that we were still seated right away and our server was just fantastic throughout the night. The menu here has just about every single thing a Mexican restaurant should have on it and from what I ve experienced  they do it all pretty well. For me  I ended up ordering the Tex-Mex burrito and let me tell you  it was a dang good burrito  The Tex-Mex burrito consisted of beef  chile con carne  cheese  and it was served with some rice and beans  what else would it be served with  . The burrito itself was delicious and I really cant think of a single bad thing about it  and the same can be said for the rice and beans  ultimately making it a perfect burrito.   Overall  Matt s El Rancho is a top notch establishment was delicious food   friendly staff  and a great restaurant to enjoy if all on. Come check this place out 
Matt's El Rancho,146,We placed our order to-go since we were staying at the KOA East in Austin and were tired after our long day  Thankful we did because the line was out the door  This must be a popular stop in Austin. This is true Tex-mex stop and not what us Arkansas folks are accustomed to. The lady on  the phone was kind with helping us order. I will Say the meal was good  but not what we were expecting. The salsa was spicy  too spicy for a few in our crew  but it was good. We had plenty of chips... 3 bags  The guacamole was chunky and had good flavor. The cheese dip was ok  we are accustomed to white queso and have learned through our Texas travels that yellow queso is not our favorite  it was still good though and we are happy we tried it. I ordered a frozen margarita to-go and they packed it up securely.... thank you  I was so nervous it would spill In the car  My family said the meat was well seasoned on the Assad taco  wish this was a gfree dish  We would recommend the place to a family looking for an authentic Austin Tex-mex location. Who knows  we might try dine in if we ever come back to Austin 
Matt's El Rancho,147,DANGGGGGG THIS REVIEW WAS 5 STARS  but it turns out you don t take AMERICAN EXPRESS.   IN AMERICA...  I haven t been leaving many reviews lately  and obviously I ve been to Matt s before  but... this is the time for a review.  I went to Maudies recently  like 3 weeks ago  and I ve made a vow not to leave bad reviews for businesses since Corona... I know these local businesses are going through enough as is  so I ve been holding my tongue.  It s been a while since I ve been to Matt s  but I gotta say  if I were the owner of Maudie s I d sell to Matt ASAP.  GET OUT FROM UNDER THAT BUSINESS. Sell it to Matt. He needs the extra space to seat his customers on the weekends anyways.  Matt s probably looking at this going   Ha  dumbbbbbb    Why would I open a second location a rock throw away   Well Matt  how many people leave on the weekends because they don t want to wait for a table  and you re not on opentable so they can t make a rezzie  --me    Exactly...   The aforementioned impatient customers could drive across the street to your extra seating.   Great meal  great service  and this  15 drink was worth it.   But seriously... no American Express... I d understand if you were a food truck. Despicable.
Matt's El Rancho,148,Heard a lot about this place but my experience was disappointing. Their queso is definitely legit but everything else was pretty bland and not as flavorful as what I would have expected.
Matt's El Rancho,149,Lyft driver suggested this restaurant on our way to our first choice for dinner. He sold us  27f  30f  and 35f  and we changed locations mid-trip.  When we arrived  Wednesday evening 730pm  there was a 50minute wait. The bar area was packed but thankfully there was lots of space in the entry for folks to wait. Our table was called after 30min.   Drinks were good. Nothing special  but good. Food was good -  with the exception of the Spanish rice that was on the salty side. It may have just been a bad batch  but I can t believe no one else had complained and they were still serving it.   It was a friends bday and they gave options for a free dessert  flan  tres leche  something else . It came out with a candle and 3 spoons. It was very really going. Moist without being mushy  and flavorful without being unnecessarily sweet.  It wasn t my favorite place for Mexican food while I visited Austin  but it was good.
Matt's El Rancho,150,Dined in on a weekend evening and seeing the parking lot full made us think we d have a long wait so pleasantly surprised when seated immediate upon requesting a table. Wow    Plenty of indoor dining and a wonderful patio with ample seating.    Great place  delicious food  prompt service  attentive staff  tasty drinks and great pricing.  Will definitely be back.
Matt's El Rancho,151,It s not the most delicious food but it is incredibly satisfying. Solid meal - got the chicken burrito which came with rice and beans. We got chips and salsa as soon as we were seated and then we already guacamole in addition. Left feeling full 
Matt's El Rancho,152,Matt s is the quintessential happy hour spot for south Austin. Been coming here for over ten years and it just keeps getting better. Bob Armstrong dip  beef fajitas  knock out Mexican martini. Done. Happy camper 
Matt's El Rancho,153,Returned to Matt s El Rancho after a long hiatus and it just wasn t the same...service was good but food was meh. I recommend the guacamole and the lunch specials are well priced. But I miss the  olden days.  Not sure if it s new management  new recipes  or just my palate  but this legendary spot has lost its place in my heart.
Matt's El Rancho,154,Excellent Tex-Mex spot  Came strictly for the Bob Armstrong Queso dip and it did not disappoint - best queso EVER  couldn t stop eating it  We got a small for 2 people  but wished we had gotten the large  it was so good. My husband had the Crenshaw Steak and I did the Green Enchiladas with chicken and topped with sour cream. All of it was delicious and flavorful - the steak was cooked to perfection and portions were generous.  Great house margaritas too  Will be back for more.
Matt's El Rancho,155,First timer in Austin  TX and this place came highly recommended and totally held up to its standards. Cary was our waitress and she was extremely attentive and friendly  Just an FYI they do not accept American Express. 10 10 recommend.
Matt's El Rancho,156,Thank you Paul for responding.  Don t spare the chili powder and the garlic.     We will definitely try your restaurant again and ask for spicy.
Matt's El Rancho,157,This a review after two separate visits. My first visit was on a Saturday and I got the chicken enchiladas. They were pretty good as was the salsa and chips. The second trip was for lunch on a weekday and it was very underwhelming. Enchiladas had no flavor  chips were all small pieces with maybe 5 chips. Not sure if I d make a return trip at this point with so many options in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,158,The food here is so fabulous   We had a family group here for our son s Baptism lunch and it was absolutely perfect. From start to finish the service and food were10 10. Thank you to our server Jackson and all of the staff for an absolutely perfect experience. I wish every restaurant was like Matt s El Rancho 
Matt's El Rancho,159,Another Austin classic  Many memories from childhood going here  Can t go wrong with El Rancho  Love their chips  amp  salsa  and fajitas  Oh  and their margaritas are delightful    
Matt's El Rancho,160,So good   You have to try this place. Their chips and salsa are fresh and the fajita meat is so tender.
Matt's El Rancho,161,For Starters Haves Thomas as your server  hands down best service  Secondly  my lovely wife  mother in law  and I had the pleasure of dining in here today  and we ve been in Austin for a very long time  this is the gem of Tex-Mex in Austin Tx.    From the service to the food  the cheese enchiladas to the rice  beans  and tortilla chips perfect flavor consistency combo  This is our new spot for the foreseeable future    Amazing job guys my hats off to you   
Matt's El Rancho,162,OMG this place is a vibe    Aside from great Tex Amex food  this place has an energy that s just so fun.  We dined on a slow night which means the wait was 30 mins but the place was just jumping.   From couples to girls  nights to big groups of gussied up young people headed to formals the crowd was diverse and respectful.  The food was excellent  too.  The chips  queso  marg s  enchiladas   Holy cats I shall remember this place and plan a return visit when we come back to the area.  So fun 
Matt's El Rancho,163,came to celebrate my birthday and was treated horrible. my friend forgot her Id and was clearly older then 21 but the staff would not serve her. come key ruined my experience and I will not be back.
Matt's El Rancho,164,is matt s el rancho fancy  no. but are you guaranteed delicious food and a good time  yes  please go there for the drinks  their margaritas were strong and tasty. oh and definitely get the quac  food portions are large and reasonably priced. our waitress was super friendly. i definitely would visit again.
Matt's El Rancho,165,Excellent food and service. Daniel was our server  and we followed his suggestions. I got the chili relleno with beef  it was cooked to perfection and unique as it had pecans and raisins on it.   I hear the wait is normally quite long  so plan ahead.
Matt's El Rancho,166,Matt s El Rancho is an institution in Austin. It doesn t mean you should dine here. Saturday dinner  7 30pm on  has the place heaving with people  including families with children of all ages.   Food  Beef and chicken fajitas for two was meant to be a pound of meat  but it was more green red pepper and onions than meet. It was served with a bowl of shredded lettuce  pico de gallo  sour cream  and cheese. There was a side plate of dry beans and dry Spanish rice  certainly not enough for two people to share. We were charged an additional  3.95 for a side of rice and beans. The flour tortillas were the best thing about that meal. Chile relleno with shrimp and sour cream sauce was inedible. The sauce had broken  shrimp was overcooked and tasted rubbery  and for whatever reason  it was served with a hefty sprinkling of raisins and chopped walnuts. Same dry beans and rice came with this meal. The best thing we had was the complementary tortilla chips  and the Bob Armstrong. Frozen margaritas were so-so.   Service  The ladies working the check-in desk could really care less about customer service. It was a busy Saturday night  but our party of four was seated after a 5-minute wait. We managed to order reasonably quickly  but service was incredibly slow. Waters did not get refilled. We had to keep asking for water and tortilla chip refills.   Cost  A shrimp chile relleno  caldo de res  soup   1lb fajita plate for two  side of rice and beans  a bob armstrong  and four margaritas ran us  115 after tax.   Overall  Hard pass. Yes  this place has been here forever  and it s family owned  etc. but whatever charm it may once have had is long gone. It s large and expansive inside  with the ability to hold hundreds of people  and it certainly does on a weekend night. But when food is mass produced on that sort of scale  it s hard to get it right for everyone. Self park or  6 valet. Takes cards.
Matt's El Rancho,167,The good was great and my server was very nice. But it s just like every other TexMex restaurant I ve been to.
Matt's El Rancho,168,An Austin classic. Service is good  food is good. Would prefer a spicier queso or thinner chips. But cant complain.
Matt's El Rancho,169,Dont get catfished by the asadero tacos they are not  one of the 120 tacos you should try before you die  go to bucees you will get more flavors from a taco. Not impressed. I was starving I had to eat. I was let down. Seemed like it was cooked lazy. But that was my opinion. They seemed busy but can t use that as an excuse. Please someone post a better review of these tacos. Let me know.
Matt's El Rancho,170,Great food and great service  can t ask for much more  We started off with 2 delicious Mango Margaritas and their world famous Bob Armstrong Dip. The chips are great  amp  the dip is everything you would want it to be.   For the main course  the wife had the Green cheese enchiladas  amp  I had the Asadero Tacos. Big portions and the food was delicious. We ll be back the next time we are in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,171,Great food awesome server very polite and friendly and made good recommendations. Nice outdoor sitting by coy fish.
Matt's El Rancho,172,    yes - 10 of 5 stars   Matt s is my favorite TexMex of all time  and that is saying a lot since I ve been eating TexMex for 45  years. Everything here is fantastic. There s nothing more to add -  1 all-time  
Matt's El Rancho,173,Matt s is our go-to for Tex-Mex in Austin. We bring all of our out-of-town guests here and they always walk away full  drunk  and happy. The atmosphere at Matt s is great for everyone  from college students to families with kids. My must-haves are the Bob Armstrong Dip and Mexican Martini  which seems a little pricey but is worth it for how strong it is.
Matt's El Rancho,174,Big Tex mex foodies traveling Austin for the best tacos we could find  amp  we were recommended by our ranch guide THIS place THE place and I am sooo happy he did. I could go swimming in the queso alone. The refried beans and Spanish rice is to die for. The wait staff is so friendly  the hostess attitudes could use a little work  but overall this is some of the best food I ve had while visiting 
Matt's El Rancho,175,We got a fajita platter to share with their queso to start off with the chips. I ve had better food to be completely honest  but I really enjoyed the atmosphere. It s a very lively environment. It was reasonably priced for the quality of food and for the restaurant atmosphere. I would probably only go here for a happy hour with coworkers and such but probably wouldn t pitch it myself.
Matt's El Rancho,176,Five stars are not enough. This place is amazing. From the moment we walked in they took our drink order  brought out chips and salsa  served our drinks and took our food order in less than ten minutes. The place was busy but the service was excellent and refilled our chips and brought us a second round of drinks as if we were the only people in the place. The food was outstanding  Everything was perfectly cooked and tasty. Whenever I am in Austin this will be my spot for Tex Mex. Wow. Loved it.
Matt's El Rancho,177,After all these years  I ve finally gotten the chance to check out Matt s El Rancho  I ve heard great things from people and had to check it out for myself. I got the   - Bob Armstrong Dip  - Asadero Tacos  - Enchiladas Suizas   Let s start with the queso - this was my favorite dish. Thick and creamy cheese with the refreshing taste of avocado and savory ground beef makes for a great combination of flavors that has you coming back for more and more bites.   The Asadero Tacos I was really looking forward to since they re filled with beef tenderloin and I envisioned them being rich in flavor and tender in texture  but ultimately they came out a bit dry and not as much flavor as I d like. Don t get me wrong  they were good  but I expected these to be better given the price tag.  Lastly  the enchiladas suizas were similar in sentiment. Although good  I felt there was more to be desired with the sour cream sauce  as usually these are pretty rich too. All in all  I m glad I came. Remember  I m half Hispanic  so naturally I am more picky with this type of food. With that said  I give Matt s a 3.5 5.
Matt's El Rancho,178,Best vegetarian fajitas I ve had   So flavorful and amazing. Pricey but worth it for the quality. Margaritas were very good - you can tell they are created with quality and excellence in mind  There s several different kinds of margaritas on the menu and we enjoyed the janie  the house margarita  not on the menu  but inexpensive and delicious   and the cactus pryor  pink drink . The cactus was sweet  the Janie was      Marcus was our server and he was on top of it and a cool guy. Restaurant has tons of space so you feel comfortable   covid     Go  And order the Armstrong queso
Matt's El Rancho,179,Best TexMex in Austin ...my  go to  place for great service  relaxed atmosphere  amp  great food. Also  they have  great patio and valet plus  plenty of self parking spaces. Random  If I could turn any structure in Austin into my home  it would hands down be this place .... It s beautiful Mexican hacienda style is stunning  my favorite  and it is on such a beautiful piece of land  Of course  everyone loves the Bob Armstrong dip and the margaritas...but  I also think they make a great hamburger and arguably the best chicken fried steak in town   In fact  I m going there tonight with a friend  an ex-Austinite currently living in CA  in need of a TexMex fix - of course  the first place she suggested was Matt s 
Matt's El Rancho,180,This restaurant is definitely overhyped. Chips and queso were just alright. Same with enchiladas and tacos. Don t waste your time here. Torchy s has better queso and tacos. Margarita was good though.
Matt's El Rancho,181,The queso is amazing   Best queso in the world. The margs are pretty good but small  The enchiladas are tasty and the tacos are large 
Matt's El Rancho,182,This place has completely sold out to the  new Austin  their prices are ridiculous now  amp  the quality has gone down. Not too mention the managers that check on the tables only check on the rich white men sitting around and could care less about the normal people.
Matt's El Rancho,183,Cliffs notes  Food was decent  our waiter was racist...  Was here with 3 other couples this week  my wife and I were the only Asians in our group. After the first round of drinks  the waiter  came and went around the table to ask if they wanted another round. When it came to my wife and I  he skipped us and began to walk away. I politely got his attention and asked if I could get another round also. His response   Sorry I can t serve you   and then walks off.  Our group sat there puzzled and perplexed. I hate race baiting and usually never jump to a conclusion that its race related  but this seemed very sketch. What happened next made me realize it was race based...  When the waiter came back with our food  I asked him why I wasn t able to have another round. His response  with a bit of annoyance and attitude   Well it s NOT because you re Asian    I then asked   what the heck does that mean and then why not   He quickly realized what he had said and backtracked saying there was a two drink minimum and that he thought this was already my second. His excuse made no sense because my wife did not order an alcoholic beverage and he totally skipped her the second time he came around. Also if he really thought this  why were the other members in my party served their second round.  The waiter eventually served me my second round and even had the gall to charge me for it.   Again in this climate I hate to race bait but this waiter was totally out of line.
Matt's El Rancho,184,4 Stars only because no place is Perfect  but I will say Matt s is pretty close to it  Recommend the Bob Armstrong dip  I made up my own plate w  a Chicken fried steak topped w  Cheese enchilada and Chili Con Carne... delicious and our waiter was more than happy to accommodate my choices. I saw this combo on a previous Yelp post  that was no longer on the menu. Outstanding service and great food and atmosphere 
Matt's El Rancho,185,The Asadero Tacos were incredible  Accurately described as one of 120 tacos you must eat before you die. Very juicy and well seasoned meat  fantastic melted asadero cheese and perfectly cooked peppers and onions. Bob Armstrong queso has a good flavor  but is not spicy . This placed is always packed  but truly is great Tex Mex.
Matt's El Rancho,186,I went there for the first time and arrived between 8pm and 9pm. The wait time was short- around 15 to 20 minutes for an outside table. We came before once and they said it would be a 30-40 minute wait. The place was packed for such a large location. We got a Shirley temple and Corona beer at the bar while waiting. The bartender didn t charge us for the Shirley temple because they didn t have big cups  and they ran out of Corona light  so he gave us Corona extra. The beer was not cold enough.  We had chips and salsa. The chips are thick and the salsa is hot. I like spicy food  but I could not enjoy the chips and salsa. I prefer thinner chips with mild salsa.  We got tacos. The tacos were delicious with a healthy serving. The beef was tender and well seasoned. The beans tasted great...Definitely not from a can. The food came hot. The chicken tacos were deep fried  but still delicious. The water did not have a weird aftertaste that some restaurants have. Overall it was a decent experience. Maybe there were some inconsistencies for running such a large place  but I wouldn t mind eating there again. They have a beautiful outside patio with water mists dispersed here and there.
Matt's El Rancho,187,Food was good but definitely different than the Mexican food I m used to in Cali. Service was great and the knockout martini was really good. The slaw and sauce they give with tacos was so so good I could eat a plate of just that. Overall it was good
Matt's El Rancho,188,My friends and I met up for dinner here for the first time since quarantine and we had a great time  The wait wasn t too long for a party of 7  however  your entire party must be there before you can be seated. After we were seated  they came out with chips and salsa  which they generously refilled multiple times during our time there  and I LOVED their salsa  The chips were huge and looked like it was the size of half a tortilla and the salsa was delicious and spicy. I ordered the Chicken Quesadilla and it was a massive plate of food. We were there for about 2 hours  which gave me enough time to finish it  but you ll definitely have some leftovers if you re not catching up with friends until they close. The chicken quesadillas were also delicious and come with guac  pico de gallo and sour cream on the side.   One nice surprise was how much parking they have here. When I think of coming this far south  I always imagine struggling to find parking  so it was one less thing to think about. The service was great here and our waiter was kind and funny. I m definitely looking forward to coming back here 
Matt's El Rancho,189,My wife and I picked this place because of the great reviews it got and it did not disappoint. Starting from the great service to the Amazing food.   I got the steak and chicken fajitas and it was delicious.   The cheese   queso  dip we got was really good as well.    I highly recommend this place.
Matt's El Rancho,190,Super attentive staff  My family visiting me in Austin loved this place  Such an authentic experience. The servers were above and beyond 
Matt's El Rancho,191,Yesterday was our second visit to Matt s El Rancho since the 25  reopening.  We could not me more pleased of Matt s with opening up to their customers and treating us all with food that is always good and margaritas that are always delicious.   Bottom line  we felt more safe and comfortable at Matt s than at HEB.  The tables are at least 10 feet apart  the menus are place mats  the seating station is outside  and the tables are sanitize before AND after each party leaves.  Please don t hesitate to enjoy another visit to Matt s  the sooner the better.
Matt's El Rancho,192,Came here at the recommendation of the hosts of the Circling Back podcast and was not disappointed.   Between the three of us  we got margaritas  a Bob Armstrong dip  asadero tacos  fish tacos  and a chicken quesadilla. All were superb--our server certainly steered us in the right direction.  The atmosphere  patio  string lights  bright dishware  and service were top notch as well. It was a great welcome to Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,193,Unpopular opinion  I don t get the hype. I ve been hearing about Matt s for years in Austin and never had the chance to try until now. The four stars are for excellent customer service and handling COVID fantastically  ex. tables spaced far apart  paper menus  and you saw employees regularly sanitizing  Food wise  Eh. It was just alright  Nothing special. Wasn t blown away. Queso wasn t anything special.    Lots of parking available which is always a big plus in Austin  
Matt's El Rancho,194,Matt s is the first restaurant my husband and I have sat in since the pandemic. We have been following a pretty strict quarantine and I must say we felt excellent about our choice. All of their staff was masked and the distance setup both outside  6ft markers  and inside. The table seperation for big and small groups were fantastic. It was a good balance of feeling like your own private meal but you can still see and occasionally hear other himans you don t live with  which I miss SO much . I saw them do a great job cleaning to turn tables.  As soon as you greet your watier your next words need to be requesting the Bob dip. It s the best queso with ground beef and guacamole I have ever had. The prickly pear margarita is delicious sweet  and the bartender had a great pour. I didn t want to get my usual texmex staples and I m so glad I ventured out. I ordered the salmon with the creamy sauce. BOMB. Cooked perfect and the creamy sauce with cilantro is a combination I m so upset has never crossed my mind. My husband had the popular  top 120 taco tontry before you die and he was very pleased. He loved the grilled cheese in the taco. We ended with a few pralines. They were just ok very few pecans in the 3 I got so I wouldn t order those again.  Overall  this is definitely my favorite Austin restaurant after one visit. We were already planning our next visit before we left the parking lot.
Matt's El Rancho,195,My wife had seen Matt s El Rancho on a television show a few years ago. They were talking about their famous Bob Armstrong dip. I have to admit that did look really good. So while we were planning our trip to Austin  we made a point to make sure we stopped here.  We stopped around 8 00pm on a Friday night. This was as busy of a restaurant as I can remember visiting. For one their parking lot is huge. I ended up parking somewhere in their  back 40 . My wife had got out to get into line while I went to park. By the time I made up to the door  we were going in. We ended up sitting on their patio. It was a cool evening however they had heaters that made it very comfortable.  We had already had dinner so this was just a snack. Service was quick and friendly. Our chips came out with some salsa. The salsa had some real spice to it. Not overly hot  but you knew you were eating salsa. Our dip arrived shortly after we had dug into our chips and salsa. The dip was cheesy  creamy and had that ground beef to fortify it and of course had the guacamole. The dip was good but maybe not as good as we were expecting. There was a lot going on and I think I would have enjoyed the guacamole separate from the cheese. I actually added some salsa with my dip to balance it and give it more flavor. The guacamole flavor kind of gets lost with the cheese. Still it was a tasty dip and we didn t have any trouble finishing our snack. If we get back to Austin I would like to check this place our for a meal as they were packed and more people were arriving when we were on our way out.
Matt's El Rancho,196,Want terrible service  Or maybe you want a 50 min wait  If so  come here. After a lonnnng work day  I went up to the bar and was told   it looks like you had a few  I can t serve you.  I wish I was a  disoriented as you assume  but I m completely sober. I was refused service because I worked 10  hours. This is exhaustion sir. Terrible service. Do not recommend. Stay in the city  and spend your money somewhere you are welcomed and respected.
Matt's El Rancho,197,Absolute BEST taco I have ever had    We ordered  the bob  queso dip. It was okay  but honestly its just hamburger meat in cheese dip. I did think the chips were really good though.   I m so indecisive so I ordered two things to share with someone. First  we ordered the Tacos al Carbon and they were great. The meat was juicy and the guacamole was delicious. But the Asadero Tacos  drool  were AMAZING. The menu says that they are one of Texas Monthly s 120 best tacos and they aren t kidding. This was the most tender meat  the cheese melted in your mouth. I ordered mine with a side of rice and no beans  and the rice was pretty good. 100  would recommend coming back and ordering these.
Matt's El Rancho,198,Great enchiladas   I got the cheese with red sauce. Salsa and chips are some of the best in Austin  Strawberry Margaritas are good and they come with sugar on brim.
Matt's El Rancho,199,Love this place. My father ate here in the 50 z while in law school  I ate here in the late 70s as a UT student  my daughter eats here and now my grandchildren have eaten here. This place is always good and the staff is very friendly. Everything we have ever had has been good. Truly homemade tortilla chips.   Last  night we had the chili RELLENOS. The were as good as always.  Topped with raisins and pecans.  Don t miss the pralines. Our go to Tex mex whil in Austin
Matt's El Rancho,200,Forever the best Mexican food in austin. Never care how long I have to wait-the atmosphere and food are always worth it.
Matt's El Rancho,201,This was a really good restaurant. The salsa and queso were tasty  the margaritas yummy yet over priced  and the hostesses probably the rudest I ve ever ran into. I enjoyed my cheese enchiladas and double rice and Grizelda took really good care of us. Will definitely go back  despite the hostesses.
Matt's El Rancho,202,I just moved to Austin and this is one of the first TexMex joints I ve ventured out to try... and I ve already found a new fave  My bf and I opted to sit outside and we were greeted with a cute little garden area with twinkly lights and a bar. The BEST atmosphere for chips  salsa and margaritas   And ooooh man  those margs were the bomb    Between the two of us  we tried 6 different kinds  amp  had to chill after chowing down for a bit. The fish tacos were bomb  Can t wait to try more here.  . 
Matt's El Rancho,203,I  sadly had to drop my rating to 3 Stars  but due to an excellent waiter  it is a solid 3 to 3 .  There has been a huge menu change  prices are significantly higher and the spice and heat level has dropped tremendously to cater to younger critters and outlanders. That being said it was still pretty good and if we had more time we would have ordered extra jalapeno  to brighten it up.  We had a tea and lemonade  still very good  and ordered a Bob Armstrong. It felt like it had lost a bit of its luster  like the difference between Chorizo and ground beef  and no heat.  I regretted that they no longer had mole   which used to be really good. So  as we were in a bit of a rush  we ordered the Taco Salad  which in my opinion is as Tex Mex as Cincinnati Chili. It was ok  but bland  which was our fault as we did not order extra jalapeno  to add. Other than that  it was pretty good. Our waiter was fantastic and we left a generous tip. However  it just does not hit the spot anymore. This is sad. Years ago it was quite good. But now  since they are not a trailer  they have to cater to their customers who have moved into the area. I wish them the best. Someday we will try again. This may have been just an off-day.
Matt's El Rancho,204,Matt s is iconic and on point. Chips thick and fresh  salsa cool and spicy. Had to chase it down with this refreshing Mexican martini. Wish I had taken pics of my meal. So much food I couldn t finish it. I m from Houston and we have plenty of Mexican food here to appeal to all palettes. I have friends who will drive to Austin for Matt s  and now I can see why.
Matt's El Rancho,205,Ok  every review that you read on here  positive  is right  I trusted yelp s judgment and found a new favorite Tex-mex restaurant in Austin. I had Asadero tacos since I read it s a favorite  and omg  The meat was so tender  So flavorful  I loved it. The cheese dip is a must for an appetizer. Sorry I was too hungry  I didn t pause to take pics  but I m sure you ll understand.
Matt's El Rancho,206,We had the best night   We had a big party and john a. and cameron took great care of us. They were patient  attentive and very hospitable. Wanted to make sure they were recognized  
Matt's El Rancho,207,Chicken fajitas were good and great service with good quantities  worth a visit for big nacho chips and salsa as well
Matt's El Rancho,208,DANIEL is the best waiter ever. Ask for him  He was so on top of his game when it was rush hour super busy. Very personable  and didn t rush us at all  considering we were at the same table for quite some time 
Matt's El Rancho,209,I had been wanting to try this place for a long time   Located on South Lamar  they have a huge parking lot but also offer Valet for  6 if you don t want the hassle.  I recommend ubering so you can enjoy a margarita or 2.  Service  Pretty good  server was friendly  he was really busy and working hard  but long delays for some things.  Also they had no clean small plates causing a mess with the queso and trying to share between the table  queso and salsa was dripping through the holes of the table.  Food Drink Items   Skinny Margarita on the rocks  5 5 stars.   So good   I was really impressed  Table chips  not great  they could upgrade  salsa was very good  hot  .    Queso   4 5 stars  really tasty  highly recommend  Chicken Enchiladas  2.5 stars  came with refried beans and rice  everything was pretty bland  the enchiladas were kind of dry as was the chicken inside.  These are edible.  But you can literally find frozen ones at the grocery store that are better than this.  Very disappointed and hope to have a better entree next time.
Matt's El Rancho,210,Matt s El Rancho is a first-mention when it comes to Texas Tex-Mex joints -- a la El Chico and El Fenix.  My apologies to Ninfa s  which is a Houston institution  but lasted a mere three years beyond H-town confines as a chain.     You ll see reviews for this place that are marginal  and others that are top notch. My guess  the marginal reviews are from younger generations that cannot comprehend the experience. The better reviews are from Tex-Mex connoisseurs  of which I am one.    As a child in the 1970s  Tex-Mex joints were populated with people in their Sunday best. When you walked through the doors  the aroma of corn knocked you over. Chips and salsa were still considered a bonus to the meal ... hot crispy goodness with red spicy goodness. It was Heaven on earth.   Matt s El Rancho still offers that experience.  Sure  you can order the  Bob   which my dinner partner did. I m more old school  chips  salsa and maybe a side order of corn tortillas with butter. On this visit  though  I treated myself to bean  amp  cheese nachos  which were dressed to the nines.   I went overboard with my dinner in an attempt to recapture some magic from a Dallas steakhouse a few years ago  Chicken fried steak topped with two cheese enchiladas and plenty of sauce and cheese.   Nirvana.  I could honestly tell my endocrinologist that I only ate half of it ... but I enjoyed it immensely. It was Texas to the bone. The rice and beans on the side made it feel all that much comfier.    The menu here offers a wide variety. Any Tex-Mex fan is bound to find something appetizing. It s cool to know that these guys are willing to cross that line and satisfy a craving.   Service here is fantastic. The place is clean and it feels like a popular Tex-Mex joint -- plenty of happy people.   Thank you Matt s El Rancho.
Matt's El Rancho,211,As far as what makes up  Austin  Matt s El Rancho is definitely a MUST have when in town. My fiancee and I had looked up items that defined the city  and found they had a queso here that was known all over. Unfortunately.. it turned out to have meat in it- not to fear  the server ended up offering vegetarian version so my fiancee could partake  and we were blown away. The specialty queso hit the spot so much  we put in on everything we ordered  minus drinks of course . I ordered a fajita dish  and she did as well  and we just put the queso on everything. Hopefully we did not overdo it. Largest problem here is that we know we ll be coming back  and continuing not to eat healthy. Make sure this is on your Austin s must haves.
Matt's El Rancho,212,Very disappointed in our last visit  and it was our last time eating here.. waited 25 mins for a table..which is no big deal BUT  after being seated 20 mins goes by and still have no drinks and haven t been visited by a waiter at all. My husband finally got up and told someone and they sent someone over to our table. Fast forward an hour and we still had no food... mind you we watched other tables come in after us and finish eating before we even received our food. The food was not even good either. It over all was a horrible experience. We won t be returning.
Matt's El Rancho,213,Okay so this place lives up to the hype  Upon walking in we were greeted by a friendly staff and the hospitality continued with our amazing waitress  We sat at a table  there are no booths  and loaded up on thick crisp tortilla chips with a decent salsa.   We started with the Bob Armstrong dip. It s a yummy queso with guac and beef mixed in. I ordered the fish tacos with the chipotle ranch sauce and my boyfriend ordered the infamous asadero tacos. I had one of my tacos and one of his. The fish were amazing with the perfect blend of slaw and sauce but nothing could prepare me for the asadero taco. The asadero is listed as Texas Monthly s must try tacos before you die and they weren t lyin   Literally best taco I ve ever had. The meat is perfectly tender and the cheese is like a warm hug.   There was no room for dessert although they looked delicious but I left completely satisfied. This is a must stop place for any Austinite. This will now be added to my list of regular stops 
Matt's El Rancho,214,Doesn t disappoint. Austin staple. Definitely will need to wait on a booming Friday or weekend night. All the margaritas are great and they have your typical Tex mex food options. Enchiladas and carne asada were great  They have both outdoor and indoor seating.
Matt's El Rancho,215,salsa is good also got the chile con queso  amp  what was funny is that i only got a bowl of queso no chile anyways got the tacos al carbon 2nd time getting this plate  amp  2nd time disappointed its good but not for its price like my friends  amp  I would say its some mid  amp  thats a compliment also charro beans are not good   drinks are good forsure
Matt's El Rancho,216,Food is okay. I m embarrassed for them that they charge  49   literally  for only one pound of fajitas. How exorbitant. And out of touch. And disgusting in this economy. But it s always been super-high  so avoid ordering this at all costs. Sucks you have to ask - repeatedly - for flour tortillas because you do not get asked if you would like some with your meal and that should be a given at a Mexican food restaurant. Also  please go to Matt s if you want your car dinged on all sides. Is it because they are too cheap to repaint the lines of their parking spots and still have the straight-line parking instead of at-an-angle parking    This would be so much easier  better  and less damaging to your car - but it looks like cramming as many cars in there as possible is the preferred plan.  Also  2  the check-in area is a mess   People yelling at you to get to the end of the line because they think  that when you are checking in to be seated after they text you that your table is ready  you are cutting them in line is to be expected. They should have a cordoned-off area for people who are getting their tables vs waiting to put their names on the wait list or who are waiting still to be called - but that would make sense... If you still decide to punish yourself and your wallet to go to MER  order the chile relleno  no batter not dipped  and get the a-la-charra beans instead of retried.  Otherwise  do what actual long-time Austinites do and go to Casa Garcia or any of the hole-in-the-wall places like Arandinas  or the BEST drive-thru in Austin - El Tacorrido  
Matt's El Rancho,217,Delicious Tex-Mex  Their tortilla chips are half the size of a tortilla so it was a flying crumb battle which was hysterical lol our service was amazing 
Matt's El Rancho,218,I have been here a few times but not for a long while. My daughter and I decided it was long overdue to get some of their delicious food.  We both ordered the small Tortilla soup. The broth is so delicious and it was served warm. There is plenty of chicken and what we both loved was the fact they put a nice amount of veggies - squash  both green and yellow  and carrots  perfect cut so they did not get soggy. One of the best Tortilla soups in Austin.  We both also ordered a cheese enchilada a la carte.  I ordered mine with Verde sauce  this was a very delicious enchilada  the Verde sauce could have been eaten with a spoon by itself and there was lots of ooey gooey yummy metly yellow cheese rolled in one of their homemade tortillas.  My daughter had the red sauce which she liked  I did not taste that so I cannot comment on it really except....maybe following up on employees in the kitchen who are supposed to be wearing hair nets  her enchilada had hair in it and we had to send it back  took a good while for another to be brought out. The waitress was very nice to take care of it and a bit shocked  well - it does happen but in a place as this  a higher standard is expected.   Overall  we enjoyed our visit here and plan to return.  Thank you.
Matt's El Rancho,219,Over priced and over rated was better when he was on a corner downtown with a cart.  Cheap deep fried taco shells for chips  no happy hour  slow service  high end prices for same old food you can get at any Mexican restaurant nothing special except the name and hype.
Matt's El Rancho,220,My second time coming to Matt s El Rancho  it has probably been 2 years. My first time I was not so impressed after having Matt s Special  but this time I was blown away.  First I started off with Pepe s Margarita  couldn t really test the blood orange but alcohol is always a good opener to a good time and a good meal.  Next I gorged myself on their nachos with the Chile con quest dip. How can anyone resist queso  It was mighty fine. Their nachos are big which I don t mind breaking apart. A bit harder than usual nachos  not sure how I feel about that  neither bad nor good.  For the main course  Asadero tacos. The flavor of the meat was all over my mouth in the first bite. I could also taste the iron of the beef. Yum. It s no wonder that it was named one of the 150 tacos to try before you die.   One thing though  the corn tortillas need to be softer  though I understand the worry of it tearing. When it cools a bit  it requires more chewing strength than desired.  Waitstaff was also very friendly.  After all that  there was no room for dessert  perhaps next time.
Matt's El Rancho,221,The food was okay  nothing special for Mexican food. But the martinis with tequila were so strong  We loved the drinks but not the food so much. Would not recommend the queso.
Matt's El Rancho,222,I have heard lots fr great things about this restaurant and have been looking forward to trying  it  but unfortunately I was very let down. I doubt I will be returning.
Matt's El Rancho,223,Came here with a buddy of mine for dinner when I was visiting town.  I wanted to try some real Texas Tex-Mex  so figured this was a good spot.    Originally was supposed to go on a Tuesday  but didn t realize the restaurant was closed.  For a nice Wednesday evening  this place was packed.  Clearly means something good  right   We waited about 25 minutes for our food  which was somewhat to be expected.  We couldn t get outdoor seating because it was more than a 45 minutes wait  so indoor was fine enough.  We split the chile con queso which tasted pretty damn good.  The chips were solid  although I wished the chips were either warmed up or came in a smaller size.  It looked like Tostitos to me  though I could easily be wrong .  I ordered the cheese enchiladas with verde sauce.  That s normally my go to item to determine if the mexican food is legit.  I was quite impressed with the food.  The combination of the two cheeses and the sauce gave me an extra kick.  The beans  amp  rice were plentiful as well.  At  12  I think it s a solid deal.  This is one of the more solid Tex Mex options in the area if you d like to try it out.
Matt's El Rancho,224,Oh man I don t know what s happened to this place  wonder if they lost their mojo   Had a below average experience at Matt s last Friday night  very disappointing to see on of my favorite go-to places decline in quality and consistency.    Friday night was very busy but we got a seat at the bar and ordered a Bob Armstrong Dip  the   award winning   Asadero tacos  and Chicken Enchiladas.  Yay.    Chips came w  salsa and chips were not warm and fresh as we used to remember.  A bit on the stale side to be honest.  They re free so we didn t say a thing.  Salsa was okay today but did not seem as fresh.    The Asadero Tacos were HORRIBLE.  Just horrid.  2 tacos for  15.50  and they were so very greasy and bland in flavor  see the shiny pic .  We salted and peppered the meat which got some improvement but there s nothing you can do about the copious amounts of grease and  probably  clarified butter w  the veggies.  OMG - it was really bad - could only manage to eat half a taco.  These were not up to par  there was an obvious cooking and execution breakdown  the excess grease was just too much to bear.  Unfortunately we should have said something but opted to let this go and won t ever get these again.  Just horrible.   Chicken Enchiladas were good - everything seemed okay with this dish  no complaints.  The Bob Armstrong Dip was under-filled  they shorted us about 1 ladle of queso  probably because they were going so fast.  The taste was good as usual  no complaints here.    Service was prompt  but bartenders were very busy and it s very loud too.  Never ate at the bar before but don t think we will again - too much going on and seemed like everything they do is rush-rush-rush and when you do that it compromises the quality of your execution and service.    Not the Matt s we re used to  but just skip those over greasy Asadero Tacos.  A very disappointing end to our Friday night.
Matt's El Rancho,225,Went on a Saturday night  the place was incredibly busy. We were told it would be an hour and 45 minutes for a table  we were called in 30 minutes which I guess was good   Food was generally very bland  almost tasteless. The pork tamales were very good.
Matt's El Rancho,226,The world certainly doesn t need another review of Matt s  but I had an epiphany of sorts this week.  I had my every 5 year colonoscopy  which isn t an auspicious way to start a restaurant review  I know.  For Breaking a 36 hour fast after my procedure   My choice was Matt s.  No one even came close.  A restaurant is typically to me a collection of 2-3 go to dishes I don t stray far from.  For Matt s it s old fashioned grilled ground beef tacos  steak Crenshaw  cheese nachos and Bob Armstrong dip  the later of which most certainly plugged any holes in my.... well.  I ll avoid being too graphic.  Sadly  COVID took its most excellent Caldo de Res off the menu  and they no longer offer a pretty tasty New  Mexican red enchilada that snuck into the menu with the old Agujas dish.
Matt's El Rancho,227,Love love love the enchiladas. I had the skinny girl margarita and I really enjoyed it. Our server was awesome and didn t miss a thing even with our large party of 10  I regret not catching his name.
Matt's El Rancho,228,Loved it all   Margaritas were great   Made with real lime juice and not a mix.  Meal was hot and delicious.  Good portions and served sizzling  Will definitely be going back.
Matt's El Rancho,229,My go to Mexican food spot it Austin when I m in town. Love their Chile Rellenos. It s always busy on game day.
Matt's El Rancho,230,Crowded  Of course  And also fantastic  It s easy to join the far-and-wide fan base that keeps this South Lamar tradition humming. Simply start by lounging on the patio and then select your favorite dish  mine is the light GF version of the chicken chile relleno with verde sauce   place your order with any one of the excellent waitstaff  sip on a signature skinny margarita while enjoying complimentary chips and salsa  savor your expertly prepared entree  and finish with a shared order of flan. There s a reason this longtime family dining establishment is truly beloved and  not surprisingly  still remains one of the coolest places in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,231,Awesome ambiance  extremely mediocre food at best. As a San Antonio native  it s such a bummer. I had the fajitas which were dry  flavorless and puny. My friend had the relleno which she was underwhelmed by.
Matt's El Rancho,232,To Go...is a No GO  We decided to order take-out after not being in the restaurant since the pandemic started.  First of all  you cannot customize any of the online orders outside of whether you want corn or flour tortillas.  The fajitas were buried under a pile of onions  typical  with barely enough meat to make 2 fajitas.  Even harder to make multiple fajitas when the sour cream  cheese  guacamole  etc. fixings are only about 2 tablespoons a piece.  The portions we so tiny we thought they were omitted from the order.  We also ordered the Bob Armstrong queso which only gets you a 1 2 bag of tortilla chips.   Ours were burnt.  I now know where the reject chips go.  I understand many restaurants are compensating to-go container costs with smaller portions  but not when you are paying dine in prices.  We ll stick with Maudie s whose prices  quality  and quantity are exceedingly better.
Matt's El Rancho,233,For all the awesome reviews  I had better food.  The place has a lot of history and was probably at some point a fantastic place to eat. My group was about 7 people so many dishes were ordered. I tasted their Guacamole  perhaps they best all of the dishes I tried.  Portion was small for the price  so we have to order more. The  Queso Fundido   not sure if that is the exact name they called it  was good and I liked it.   I ordered  Chile Relleno .  It was extremely greasy and the chile part was almost none existent and it was filled with cheddar cheese instead of the usual Mexican white cheese  so I was disappointed. Overall  I had better mexican food. It you want to go for the ambiance and drinks  this is a good place  but for Mexican or Tex-Mex food  this is not the place.
Matt's El Rancho,234,This is by far the best Tex Mex restaurant throughout the entire state of Texas  My parents have been eating here since the 70 s and I ve been eating here since I was born in 1988  so I grew up eating at this place. They have the best fajitas and Margaritas. I ve never had a bad experience here  it s been nothing but positive experiences and great service. I come here as frequent as I can  to get a Knockout Martini  A large Bob and some beef fajitas. I m glad they have been able to stay open during Covid. Love you guys  I ll be coming here for my 33rd birthday this summer. Can t wait to have a few knockouts  A large Bob and some fajitas  Haha
Matt's El Rancho,235,Delicious food  great service and definitely worth the wait. Highly recommend the Bob Armstrong queso.
Matt's El Rancho,236,Nothing says  Mexican food  like Matt s   I opted for the queso and chips along with Tacos Al Carpone. Sooo good. The meat was so tender and the perfect flavor.   Try their Prickly Pear margaritas. They are addicting   Great place for Mole as well.   Beautiful establishment and really swell waitstaff.
Matt's El Rancho,237,The best ................                            Matt is always good. That s their motto. It s worth the wait  I hope that Matt continues to keep doing what they re doing  providing the best Mexican food and service at a fair price.
Matt's El Rancho,238,Ate here on a Saturday evening about 6 30. Food was good  hot  served quickly. The place was packed with people - they take no reservations. There is insufficient parking. Had to park on the street about three blocks away.
Matt's El Rancho,239,Thank You Corinne for being an awesome waitress     You took excellent care of Mrs. Texas and I  and we truly appreciate it     This was my fourth time here  but Mrs. Texas  first. She very much enjoyed the chips n salsa  and her chicken flautas. I went for the blackened redfish with grilled zucchini and grilled squash  Slap Yo Momma Good . It also comes with rice and a side salad  with cilantro dressing  delicious dressing . You get plenty of food and we both left with to go containers. The place is clean  the staff is friendly  and the atmosphere is AUSTIN      Dine indoors or outdoors. They have a great menu selection and lunch specials during the week. They also offer a variety of adult beverages. Worthy of a bookmark and a try if you re passing through  or if you live or work nearby. Ask for Corinne. You won t be disappointed with her service  I guarantee it     
Matt's El Rancho,240,So this was my first time at the famed Matt s El Rancho. In all the six years that I lived in Austin  I never once gave it a try. It took me moving thousands of miles away to finally see what the hype was about.   My thoughts  meh.   Don t get me wrong. The Bob Armstrong dip is a thing of beauty. It s probably one of the most classic bowls of queso I ve had. And the portion was big enough to make two people feel incredibly full. So much so that me and a friend had to change our dinner plans. One dip and margarita in  we were too full to even order a proper entree. However  I wasn t that sad about that fact because    Meh Item  1  The food is pretty pricey here. Like  too pricey. Austin is filled to the brim with yummy Tex Mex joints  with many being more authentic in flavor than Matt s. I ll pay less for more flavor elsewhere any day.   Meh Item  2   The happy hour wasn t that great.  1-2 off their house margarita. That s it   Cheap  delicious frozen margs are the Texas happy hour drink of choice. I was expecting more...  This place isn t bad. It s just not memorable. But when I m back in my home state and looking for some delicious Tex Mex in Austin  Matt s won t instantly come up in my head as the place for that.
Matt's El Rancho,241,When you look at Matt s yelp rating you might think that this is a polarizing establishment but honestly you would be wrong.  There are many things they do that are average when it comes to Mexican food in general but especially in Austin. HOWEVER when it comes to their staples and by that I mean their fajitas  their queso  and their alcoholic drink selection  there is absolutely no true competition. If your favorite Mexican food is enchiladas or a quesadilla  you may be a bit underwhelmed. But if you re into the staples I mentioned above  Matt will set the bar for the rest of your Mexican food career.   Don t stray from the classics here and you ll be just fine 
Matt's El Rancho,242,We LOVE Matt s and come here at least once a week. Great food and drinks and awesome staff  Unfortunately tonight  we had an entire tray of drinks spilled on us including broken plates. My hair was wet  entire back soaked down through my jeans down to my shoes. I understand accidents happen. The manager brought me a shirt to change into. When the check came  nothing was comped which was rather disappointing after sitting though our entire meal in wet pants. When I reminded our awesome server of what had happened  they comped my  11 meal on the total bill of  95. I m not sure what s right here  but leaving the restaurant still wet with that just didn t feel right.
Matt's El Rancho,243,LEGIT. Austin institution since 1952. This is O.G. Austin y all. It s not fancy  it s keeping it real. Great place to have margaritas with a large Bob  queso . The Mexican pizza is overlooked. The brisket tacos are great. Fajitas are tex-mexcellent. If you go and don t like it  go back and have one more margarita than you had the time before. Repeat until it is your favorite restaurant. You too will agree that Matt s is  always good...   78704FTW
Matt's El Rancho,244,Food is actually quite decent and their drinks will have you knocked out  definitely try it
Matt's El Rancho,245,If I was able to go back 10 years ago and tell myself  you re going to eat a lot more Matt s El Rancho than you ever thought you would   my historical self would have slapped my present tense self.  But here we are.  It s a straight shot for us to pick up dinner from Matt s as we re driving our daughter to dance. With COVID  the question is who can do pick up   Looks like Matt s has a pretty good plan.   While they don t have an online ordering platform  that would help the fifth star come up   ordering over the phone wasn t difficult.  The menu on their website is short of the full menu  or I didn t surf around to find everything else.  My wife found a full menu on her phone.  They quoted 35 minutes.  I showed up about at that time and the bag was at the car a minute or two after I called from the curbside space. The bag was well packed.  Cold things together in one bag  hot things isolated in another.  All of it tied up in a bigger bag.  I liked seeing the checklist and stickers on our containers.  Nothing was missing.  Their to-go containers are well sealed.  I m curious what kind of plastic it is and still won t use them in the microwave.  They are surely better than stryofoam clamshells.  No spillage on the way home means no disappointment. The cheese enchiladas hit every note I wanted them to.  The chili con carne sauce is fantastic and classic.  The plain queso was the right consistency  everyone has been watery lately  and my wife couldn t take a bite of guac without adding  man  that s good guac  every time.  Our daughter was less impressed with the grilled old fashioned tacos.  A little greasy for her taste. I was shocked at how many people were standing outside waiting to get in.  I did the curbside pick up  so I don t know how many folks were inside.  The parking lot was still pretty full.  Since we ve been regularly going for the past two years  I can say it wasn t quite as busy as usual  but not by much.  Still more people than I want to share space with. One reason why I know I didn t like going to Matt s in the past was the price.  It is not cheap Mexican food.  I was in San Antonio recently and paid half for three people what we paid at Matt s last night.  It was good enough  I can overlook the bill now.
Matt's El Rancho,246,Go somewhere else. You can make this stuff at home heb refried beans plus mi tienda rice gets you halfway there
Matt's El Rancho,247,I have ALWAYS been a big fan of Matt s El Rancho  Go to Mexican place  especially when we have out of town guests. We LOVE Melvin and Jenna  they are invaluable to this organization.   I can t believe I did not have a review already  BUT happy to review now during this pandemic. Matt s has done such an excellent job with their to-go orders  as well as reopening their in person dining. Their food to-go is so well packaged and still warm when arriving home. Regarding reopening I have found their process smooth and safe  sitting on the patio is warm but still a great option. Indoors is also well done  with enough distance between the tables.   My favorite entrees are the redfish tacos  asadero tacos  and the blackened redfish. Portions are HUGE. Favorite drinks are frozen sangria margarita and the knockout.  CHECK THEM OUT  all while continuing to be safe during this crazy time 
Matt's El Rancho,248,Worst restaurant. Service was awful. They don t split checks either  Because they were  too busy .
Matt's El Rancho,249,Tonight I have to give shout out to our waitress Brenda. We called to ask about reservations for a party of 12  but we were told that they do not take reservations but to come before 6pm and it wouldn t be a problem. We arrived at about 545pm and we were seated in 10 minutes and Brenda introduced herself as our waitress. She was spot on even tho she was the only one assigned to our table. She took 12 different orders with drinks and the orders were correct and timely. The food as always was good and the prices were great for an evening meal.  By the time we left the place was packed  so go early or be prepared to wait but if you have to wait it will be worth the effort.
Matt's El Rancho,250,David B is awesome. The place was super busy Andrew loud and he really took time to take care of our table. He has a lot of energy and great hair. Also the food was good.
Matt's El Rancho,251,Decided to give Matt s El Rancho another try after having not been in years and I was still terribly disappointed in the food.  The Bob Armstrong queso seems like melted Velveeta with greasy hamburger inside so much so you get to see the grease from the meat floating in the cheese. Ordered the 1 lb fajitas and there is something truly strange about the sauce they put on the fajitas chicken and the veggies.  It s just not the right flavor for fajitas at all.  In addition the sides that come with these 29.99 fajitas are pitiful.  I would say there was enough cheese for maybe half of a tortilla  the rice and beans was a pitiful amount also seeing as these fajitas are nowhere near cheap but the sides are a very cheap portion.  To top off the meal I was handed a filthy plate to eat my fajitas off of which was very appetizing.  50.00 dollars for absolutely bad food  very disappointing.  A general manager who attacks patrons personally is very professional.  A general manager who doesn t bother to read the reviews is also impressive.  Thanks for the info about the beef when the review clearly says I had chicken.  Thanks for the acknowledgement of the filthy plates  I am sure those are prime Angus dirty plates as well.  I have read many responses from this manager and it s excuses and belittling the patrons  sorry this is not how you respond to feedback.
Matt's El Rancho,252,omg - loved it  Not perfect but we still loved it. The salsa is made daily and tonight it was really over-the-top spicy. Apparently  it s made fresh daily and you are at the mercy of this person s taste buds. The too-hot salsa was a bummer because they only make one batch a day. Take it or leave it. Our waitress was absolutely adorable and she alone is enough to recommend this place.  Cocktails were yummy. Beers were cold. Fresh chips. Homemade salsa. Hubby loved his chicken fajitas. I had pork and pineapple soft tacos and they were wonderful. We would definitely dine here again.
Matt's El Rancho,253,Solid 3.5 stars and classic Tex Mex  Come early especially on the weekends because this place gets PACKED and super noisy   Boyfriend and I got a small Bob Armstrong dip  queso  ground beef  guac  to share and he got the deluxe dinner and I got the green chicken enchiladas topped with queso.   Bob Armstrong dip was solid  would get this again  Cheese was nice and hot  flavors were all there. Not the best queso I ve had in town but good enough to order again and a great pairing with the salsa. Chips were HUGE   I really enjoyed my chicken enchiladas  didn t care for the guac salad that came beforehand though -- sad looking pile of lettuce with a small scoop of avocado on top. The salsa verde on the enchiladas was amazing though  and the cheese was just perfect -- this was even good heated up the next day  so that should tell you something. Average rice and beans  which is usually how I determine the quality of a Tex-Mex place  but definitely not bad. Huge portion   Boyfriend didn t really enjoy his dish and the beef tamale he had was so dry it looked sad and limp. We ve been spoiled by Delia s in the RGV do standards are high between the two of us -- he said he d order something else next time because it was subpar.   Service was ok -- server we had seemed rushed and didn t hear us when we ordered our margarita so we never got it  but mistakes happen -- no biggie. Everything else was great though  waters and chips were always refilled immediately and we were checked on by a manager.  Overall  we d come back  A little touristy but it s a fun date night environment 
Matt's El Rancho,254,The 2 hour long waits make much more sense after eating here. This spot had theee best steak fajitas I ve had. The staff is super friendly and you will not leave hungry. Well worth the wait 
Matt's El Rancho,255,I have been trying to find a good Mexican restaurant in Texas since I have moved here. I have tried a lot of different places and I was told that Matt s El Rancho was the best around. Well  I went there for lunch and was highly disappointed once again. My meal wasn t great and I found part of a plastic bag in my food. The guacamole and the service was fantastic but that was about it. I still have not found a good Mexican restaurant in Texas.
Matt's El Rancho,256,Asadero tacos were FANTASTIC. Texas Monthly was right  I needed to try these before I die  Delicious.
Matt's El Rancho,257,First  the food was good  we all had fajitas and the fixings. The cheese dip was above average. Our server was friendly  personable  and worked hard at all her tables.   Here comes the downer- the flies were obnoxiously everywhere. We were seated neat a window  late afternoon  mud June  so that contributed to the pests  but this was another level. One kamikazied into my margarita  the server replaced it with no problem . There must have been 250 of them around us. Not exaggerating.  I ll be surprised if it dampens their patronage  it is an institution.
Matt's El Rancho,258,Very good Tex-Mex. We got the Bob Armstrong queso  a chile relleno with shrimp and ranchero  and green enchiladas with cheese. Everything was very good  and my wife absolutely loved the queso in particular.  I m not the biggest Tex-Mex fan in general  but I m glad we came and had the experience.
Matt's El Rancho,259,Just ate here for the first time  since moving to austin food was pretty good had the chicken enchiladas verde nice wait staff
Matt's El Rancho,260,Atmosphere was very busy  lively  but we were seated immediately outside. Table was a cute two top right next to the little koi fish pond. As far as the ambiance  it was great  Super inviting.  I feel bad forgetting the name of our waitress but she was great   I m pretty sure the hostess said we were going to table 217   Anyway  she was friendly  funny  and accommodating.   Drinks were delicious--bf got a martini and I got the raspberry frozen margarita. As far as the food goes--meh  mediocre. Nothing special and nothing I will remember. He had one of the house specials and I had the chicken flautas. Everything was just generally bland  which is so opposite of what Mexican food should be  I get that this is Tex-Mex  so it s pretty average compared to others when you place it in that field  but I guess I just expected a little more after reading all the reviews.  This place is more of the  overall experience  rather than a focus on the food itself.
Matt's El Rancho,261,Cheese enchiladas with chile con carne are my all time favorite -- when they are made well  that is -- and when I try a Tex-Mex restaurant for the first time I always start with those to gauge how I feel about a place. And these cheese enchiladas made me say  THAT S what I have been craving  after the first bite. It s a particular taste that had surprisingly proven itself to be pretty elusive since I moved to Austin. I think it s tougher to truly master the basics in a memorable way than it is to whip up something fancy and unique. After all  cheese enchiladas are everywhere. THESE cheese enchiladas are memorable  not in that they are different  but in that the recipe and execution are exactly as they should be -- to a degree that would make me trust absolutely anything on the menu. And I look forward to trying it all -- that is  if I can bring myself to order something other than enchiladas. Shout out to to the very friendly service too  See you again very soon.
Matt's El Rancho,262,ONE of Austin s must.  The food is consistently good and the service is always great. The portions are sized right for the hungry patron. The large Bob is a must for sure. The chips are uniquely thiers  thick half tortillas basically.
Matt's El Rancho,263,I went to el Rancho on a Sunday afternoon. We didn t have to wait and sat outside. There were so many birds very close to us because a table outside remained uncleaned. We ended up switching to a table inside. We ordered the bob Armstrong queso and it was so good. However  it was the only good thing there. I ordered the smoked chicken enchilada and it took forever to get it. It was very bland and the rice seemed over cooked. I only took 2 bites and left the rest. Probably won t come back.
Matt's El Rancho,264,Had lunch at Matt s El Rancho on Monday afternoon. A Tex-Mex spot that feels a lot like a chain restaurant. They have some solid dishes  but many that don t take the needed risks to be great.  Quality  Matt s El Rancho kept coming up as a classic Tex-Mex spot in Austin  so we made our way over for lunch. Our meal started with Frozen Margaritas and a Small Bob Armstrong Dip. The Margaritas were perfect  I went with some mango flavor and was very happy with the result. The Bob Armstrong does not live up to its hype  but was still a solid dip to go along with the spicy salsa. The Certified Angus Beef Fajita Quesadillas were stuffed with meat and peppers  but could have used a bit more cheese. Matt s Footlong Enchilada was good  but I was not crazy about the sauce. Quantity  Everything was huge. The Footlong Enchilada is in fact a foot  but every dish is too much for one person to finish on their own. Value   10 for a Frozen Margarita.  7 for a Small Bob Armstrong Dip.  14 for the Certified Angus Beef Fajita Quesadillas.  11 for Matt s Footlong Enchilada.  Ambiance  Matt s El Rancho is located south of Downtown Austin. The restaurant looks and acts much like a chain. From the decor to the paper place mats  it has that style. The restaurant itself is huge with a large outdoor patio and an even bigger indoor dining area  complete with full sized bar. We were placed in a smaller room with televisions on the wall and easy access to the bar. The music switched back and forth from Spanish classics to old-school country. Crowd  A small crowd for late weekday lunch. Service  Our waiter was fantastic. Extremely enthusiastic with tons of Texas charm.  Parking  Huge private parking lot.
Matt's El Rancho,265,I ve always loved Matt s.  It s an Austin institution.  Consistently delicious and home town proud.  We decided  after an emotional funeral today  to celebrate the life of a family friend by dining at Matt s.  A few margs  a lot of memories  and Bob Armstrong dip were enjoyed.  Kameron was our waiter and did an absolutely exemplary job.  A true pro.  Another great night at one of our favorites.
Matt's El Rancho,266,Update- corona edition   First time out since quarantine so of course we hit our favorite spot  Matt s was the PERFECT place to go as our first night out in months.   They handled this entire situation pretty well   Every employee i saw had masks and gloves. You couldnt order margs on the rock because that includes touching the rim  so most margs were frozen only. They gave limes on the side of coronas  menus were paper to throw them out after and silverware was wrapped in paper. Tables were over six feet apart. Indoors and out.   Professional and well done. I felt safe.   Food perfect as always.  Job well done and have never had a bad meal. Always impressed.
Matt's El Rancho,267,Excellent. Would recommend to anyone coming into town. It s super busy  but the food was awesome and the service was great. You can t go wrong with the enchiladas and everything else on the menu is definitely worth giving a shot to see what you like.
Matt's El Rancho,268,Tried this place for the first time. The asadero tacos were good and the verde margarita was strong enough . The shrimp enchilada were a little salty for us but maybe ok for others. Sopapillas were ok. The sherber was really good. Beef enchiladas were also good.
Matt's El Rancho,269,When travelling to Austin for work  some local co-workers mentioned this as one of the best Tex-Mex places to try.  Boy were they right.  This place is quite large so getting a table on a weeknight wasn t that hard despite how busy they were.  The chips and salsa they brought out at the start of the meal was perfect and the salsa had quite a bite to it  which is a plus in my book.   I ended up trying the brisket tacos and they were some of the best tacos I ve had.  The rice and beans along with the pico was a perfect pairing to the dish.  Matt s El Rancho is definitely somewhere I ll be coming back to anytime I end up in Austin.  Oh and one thing to note is that they do close on Tuesday s so plan accordingly.
Matt's El Rancho,270,The food here is definitely hyped up and IT 100  lives up to the hype. I ate here alone on a work trip and the staff were so nice as I had my 3 course meal for 1. Every thing was delicious and the drinks are so unique and worth having  I can t wait to move to Austin and make this my regular spot
Matt's El Rancho,271,Austin staple  Food and atmosphere is great  Love their Mexican Martini s. You have to get the Bob Queso Dip 
Matt's El Rancho,272,Exceent Fish tacos and beef enchiladas  rice  amp  beans.  Great service.  Chips homemade as was salsa.
Matt's El Rancho,273,This place has best fish tacos in Austin. Not even on the list why i stopped yelping.  grilled redfish with cilantro vinaigrette da best     Take out is fast and easy. The people of austin could not wait to get back into this place. Gone back to regularly closing on tuesdays.
Matt's El Rancho,274,First visit to Matt s El Rancho.  There is plenty of parking on a lot of real estate on South Lamar in Austin Texas.   The grounds are attractive as is the building with a beautiful vine covered rock walls exterior where patrons line up for group photos .  The inside of the restaurant is tastefully ornated in earth tone pastels.  The tables are large and generous.  The seating areas are roomy and comfortable.  The floors  walls and in general the space provides an atmosphere of cleanliness and good maintenance practices. It feels like dining in someone s home.  The menu is well organized and easy to read.  I decided on Matt s special  my lady a cheese and a beef enchilada  with texmex sauce.    Matt s beef is flavorful.  The green sauce on the special is very tasty.   The rice is superb in texture and very nice in flavor.  The refried beans are very good.  The tex mex sauce was reported fantastic by the picky eater who says Matt s is the new favorite best Mexican food she ever had   The tostada first course of the special is absolutely amazing.  The attentive and knowledgeable waitress Charmaine explained that the secret to the tostada is tomato vinaigrette.  You gotta  have a tostada or get the tostatda meal.  The chips are very good - thick half sliced fried tortillas.  The salsa is very good - close to the spicy end of the scale.  I am normally a sauce guy and will have everything swimming in the salsa.  Not tonight.  All of the items stood very well on their own  thank you   Matt s is epic.   We will be back soon.
Matt's El Rancho,275,My GO TO Mexican place in Austin. Their queso  get the bob  is unbeatable and they are one of the few places that have skinny frozen margs.   Other favorites are the the Asadero Tacos  kind of expensive   the beef fajitas  and some of the dinner plates.   A MUST GO for anyone wanting to try Tex mex and a austin local favorite. Only thing is they don t take reservations but the longest I have ever waited  even in quarantine  is 20 min Bc the place is so big 
Matt's El Rancho,276,They did a good job social distancing. Our waiter was pretty slow getting things out and when we asked for items we got a very small amount. This might be just protocall for right now but it was annoying. 4 people asked for salt and we got 2 small packets. They ran out of chips. The fajitas were pretty standard and the queso was very bland. Not great service or food.
Matt's El Rancho,277,First time here  Big parking lot  Friendly staff  15 minute wait for a table on Saturday night at 5 pm  Ordering Chicken Fried Steak dinner  AC is working  Somewhat noisy
Matt's El Rancho,278,I placed an online order and arrived at the scheduled pickup time. They had given my order to someone else since they had asked for it by name. It all the orders are sitting there with names clearly printed on them. So it s easy for someone to scam. Yet - I got questioned and they take no responsibility. DO NOT order pickup from this place.  In response to the managements comments. The gift card was only offered after I complained and asked for my tip  placed online when ordering  back  since I was having to wait an additional 20 minutes.  When I pointed out that I live out of town and a giftcard want helpful since I wouldn t be back  he shrugged. So  I paid full price  tipped for bad service  and my wife had to sit in the car with two very hungry and very grumpy young children while the manager got me the food I paid for  but I guess that qualifies as good service for this restaurant.
Matt's El Rancho,279,Worth the wait  Ahhh  loved their food and the ambiance is happening. We are from houston and this place reminds me of a brighter  well lit el tiempo  They have great vegetarian options and the restaurant is huge  Be ready for a crazy wait on the weekends 
Matt's El Rancho,280,I felt safe dining here as the staff took extra safety precautions. Everyone was wearing a mask. Great service  drinks  and food  I look forward coming back and trying other items from their menu. The Matt s special and chicken enchiladas were good. I m not a fan of queso but my friends enjoyed it. The only thing I didn t really like were their complimentary chips. They were a little hard and stale.
Matt's El Rancho,281,Classic austin. Food is great - love the asadero tacos. The knockout martini is a must.
Matt's El Rancho,282,Unfortunately this restaurant has chosen not to be smart about doing business.   On good Friday we tried to eat there. An hour wait for lunch at 2 00   Went inside - the patio was empty. Both the front and the back dining rooms were empty. But they had people waiting an hour 1 why   To look busy   Or just poor scheduling management  Save your time and go to Maudie s.
Matt's El Rancho,283,One of the best spots for Mexican food in austin  the queso will blow your mind  so will the Mexican martinis  and get the fajitas you won t be sorry. Also don t plan on going out after  plan on rolling home to the couch for a nice movie and a beer to top off your martini binge  Enjoy
Matt's El Rancho,284,We had a fantastic time at this place. The food is great. Drinks are even better but the 4 star rating is fit their desserts. We ordered a flan and it was really small.  The dirty martini  was really good though 
Matt's El Rancho,285,We needed a place for an important business lunch and I suggested Matt s Famous El Rancho. It is a place with great Tex-Mex and capable to handle large groups.    Located right on South Lamar in middle of other excellent food options in the area.  A reservation was setup and I arrived early with plenty of parking available.  Some attendees were already in the lobby and waited until most showed up before seating.  We were seated a big room with other few people in it. Chips and salsa quickly appeared on the table and drink orders taken.  We had a very nice server who made sure we had everything we needed.  After our final guests arrived each person ordered an item from the menu.    The salsa was a hit with our out of town guests. Some orders had a pre course where for me was a crispy taco.  It was very tasty. Soon our main meal arrived and all were served at the same time.  Everyone enjoyed their food  and my plate had one tamale and enchilada along with rice and beans.  Every was satisfactory and good.  If it was not for business then would have ordered a margarita where in the the past all the ones I had were very good.  Everyone had an excellent lunch and thanks to the staff for making sure everyone had a great experience 
Matt's El Rancho,286,Just FYI - Matt s has instituted a 3 margarita limit per person and a 2 martini limit per person.
Matt's El Rancho,287,Been living in Austin almost 20 years and I d never been to Matt s until yesterday. Finally made it to this long standing Mexican food institution. Was with a group of about 8 work peeps  we sat out on their expansive patio. Their beautiful fountain provided a soothing backdrop to our lunch. Only complaints. about sitting on the patio  we sometimes felt a bit forgotten by our server and we almost got dive bombed a few times by the massive pigeons that were hanging out waiting for leftovers.  Sampled some of their famous Bob Armstrong dip. It was definitely everything my coworker explained to be. It would be real easy to make a meal out of that. Also their chips which they make onsite are phenomenal. A great compliment to the dip. Knockout Martini was my drink of choice  a well made  very smooth Mexican Martini. Carne Guisada lunch special-- it was merely ok. It was underseasoned for my taste. If I return I would definitely try another dish. Matt Jr s Potatoes--very hard to describe but it worked well. Spicy  salty  all of the above. I enjoyed my visit to Matt s. Good folks and great service. I definitely see why they ve been in business as long as they have.
Matt's El Rancho,288,Best Mexican restaurant in Austin    It s so good  we bring all our guests here. Our favorites include the margaritas  cheese  amp  shrimp quesadillas  cheese dip and burritos. It s nice that they have outside and inside seating to offer.   The only thing is they don t take reservations and it can get quite busy. If you have to wait for a table  I suggest heading over to Bouldin Acres and getting a drink while you wait.
Matt's El Rancho,289,The food is good specially their fajitas and their drinks. Only giving three stars because their service is horrible. The hostess are rude and speak about you in spanish  I know because i m fluent in spanish and they didn t realize  and both times I have been our waiters have been the least attentive.
Matt's El Rancho,290,Still the best Tex Mex anywhere in my experience  and I have a lot of experience.  The gold standard by which all other Tex mex establishments are held.  The OG of Tex Mex.  Go for any classic item  or most especially their famous tenderloin tacos  pair it with a Margy  or iced tea if you are going dry  and enjoy.
Matt's El Rancho,291,Our first meal getting to Austin and it was great  Everything we ordered we loved  I got the taco salad with angus beef and it was delicious  so much flavor  so fresh  really delicious  also had several dressings for me to choose from  but did not even really need it  My sister got the spinach poblanitas enchiladas and really liked it  thought it was something different and really good  Dad got a chicken burrito that came with sides and ate the whole thing without stopping  could not stop raving about it  Mom also got a salad  the combo salad with chicken and loved it   Our server was great  so friendly and offered several suggestions about drinks and food  As well  the chips and salsa came quickly when we got there  so delicious and they get refilling whenever it was empty 
Matt's El Rancho,292,For real the best Mexican food ever  The patio is one of my favorites. I feel like I am in Mexico when I am here it s so authentic. The salsa is some of the best you can find anywhere. Eat here 
Matt's El Rancho,293,Matt s is absolutely amazing   We loooove the patio  it is so relaxing and such a great vibe. Our girls love to watch the Koi fish while we dine.  They have amazing fajitas and fresh tortillas. The Knockout Martini is so good  their prickly pear margarita is pretty darn good too. Their lunch menu during the week has huge portions for a great price.  This place gets seems to get busier as the day goes on. But  it s always worth the wait 
Matt's El Rancho,294,I am not local to Austin but this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the entire country.  It was love at first bite and I look forward to visiting Austin because of this spot.  There is usually a decent wait so be prepared to order a margarita and wait. The prickly pear margarita is a staple if you ve never had it. It s a good mix between sweet and sour and the magenta color is just plain cool.  Bob Armstrong Dip - get a large order of this the second you sit down.  it s my favorite thing about Matt s and I could probably order this for my entree if it was socially acceptable to eat an entire basket of chips with queso Matt s Special - The beef taco will come before the meal so be ready to eat when you order this.  The main dish of chicken enchiladas with green sauce with queso  refried beans  and rice all on the same plate is the perfect recipe to get a bite of everything at once. Smoked Brisket Tacos - another staple at Matt s  I will always compare every Mexican restaurant to Matt s because I love it so much.  I m pretty sure there isn t another Mexican place that will ever measure up to Matt s.
Matt's El Rancho,295,You gotta have the Bob Armstrong dip  A very special queso  with the bowl almost as big as the entire state of Texas. It comes out warm and just the slightest bit of cheese film on the top  which means it s gonna taste good.  Beyond the Bob Armstrong  Matt s also has wide variety of margaritas. Sweet  tart and fruity  they all have just enough alcohol for a little hair o  the dog. A few of those helped nurse me back to health on a Sunday morning.   Beyond the apps and drinks  Matt s has a nice outdoor patio with a fish pond. Kids love it  You just have to keep an eye on them so they don t fall over the edge and into the water. I doubt it happens too often  but I bet lots of little ones have gotten very close.
Matt's El Rancho,296,I finally went here for the first time last weekend. I am on a very strict diet  and I decided to use this as my 1st cheat day in 30 days  So I knew it better be worth it   My husband was worried. I m from west Texas so I am very picky about my Tex Mex- this interior Mexican crap around here is not my game.   Anyhoo  I ordered the fajitas and the Mexican Martini. Wow  I ate every morsel of the fajitas they were so good  And I love that they aren t stingy with tortillas and you can ask for more    At less than 1 cent a piece to make  I have never understood why restaurants are so stingy with them. Anyhoo  my carb-starved self probably freaked out the table behind me with my sounds of delight over the tortillas.   And the Mexican martini  Dang  I was outta there  That sucker was strong AND delicious    I would tell you how my husband s food was  but I was too tipsy and self-involved with my own food to worry about him- but he didn t complain- so I m assuming he was happy as well  lol.   The service was phenomenal as well- I wish I could remember the older gentleman s name who waited on us  but...Mexican Martini.
Matt's El Rancho,297,A friend and I decided to eat here. I have been here before a few years back and had an amazing time. Unfortunately  this time was a bit different. The seating staff sat us in an area there were a group full of college students. They were very loud and annoying. We were surrounded by them and we couldn t  even hear ourselves or have a conversation. However  the food was really good and for that I get them 2 stars. I will be back and hopefully the next experience is different.
Matt's El Rancho,298,An Austin institution worthy of all of the praise it receives. This is a place that keeps my local Austin friends happy and where I can also bring out-of-towners for a quintessential Austin experience.   That s what Matt s is all about - the experience. Coming here on a Friday or Saturday night is my favorite time to come here. Yes  it s packed and you should prepare to wait  but it s exciting and lively. The margaritas are excellent and time goes by fast when I m waiting at the bar having a few.   The patio is large and pretty. It s the perfect setting to overeat and drink. The chips here are home made and huge. The salsa is addictive. But what really stands out is the Bob Armstrong dip. Queso with all the fixins. It s absolute perfection. I usually get the veggie version that subs black beans for ground beef. And I always get a large no matter how many people I m with. Getting a small would be a rookie mistake.   The main dishes are pretty great too. My only minor complaint is that the fajitas need improvement.   Awesome spot all around. Great for everything from a birthday or special event to a casual night out.
Matt's El Rancho,299,Very disappointing when you can t make a to go order because the answering machine thinks it s Tuesday and that they are closed. Unprofessional.
Matt's El Rancho,300,Started off fine but then food was wrong  then food was cold.  A manager never stopped by and then our server never stopped by.  Went to pay  nothing was comped even with wrong and then cold food  not that I expected it to be  and they no longer take Amex.  Then waited for the server for 15 mins to come back by to pick up payment.  Clearing plates from empty tables was more of a priority than attending to tables with people.
Matt's El Rancho,301,This place is delicious.  From the salsa that comes out with the chips to what you decide to order. Customer service is great. From when you walk in to be seated to paying the bill. Customer services is on point. I have been here a few times and everytime the food has been delicious. The menu prices are very reasonable. This place is worth checking out.
Matt's El Rancho,302,DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE    I want to start this review by saying this is TERRIBLY overrated. I waited for 45 minutes in my car for a 2 person table  and if the food had been good  I wouldn t have complained.   I lived in Austin for 4 years 2012-2016  when I went to Matt s during THAT time  it was great. That being said  it is no longer great. The vibes are fine  but that s the extent of the good part. It is now way overcrowded to the point that the staff can t keep up. The food no longer has any flavor  and I no longer enjoy this place.   I really just want to help those of you that are looking for a  good Austin Tex Mex restaurant . If that is you  this is NOT the place to go. Please do not waste your night in Austin like we did. It is a fantastic city  there are so many better places to go while you are here 
Matt's El Rancho,303,Solid traditional TexMex food in a building with style to match. Sprawling parking lot can get full. Filling lunch plates  good traditional selections. Steak fajitas had a nice marinade and weren t fatty or gristly. Medium salsa is chunky. Very good rice and charro beans but no guacamole served on the lunch plate. Good homemade tortillas. Generous portions.
Matt's El Rancho,304,Popped in here on a sunny turned rainy Saturday afternoon for an early dinner of Mexican margaritas and Tex-Mex burritos. Had the pleasure of being served by Jamie  who is absolutely fantastic. Always attentive  kept our drinks flowing and was great to chat to. Can t recommend Matt s or Jamie enough   Thankyou for the great service  Update  Paul  glad talking to Jamie today this feedback loop worked. Have a great day  
Matt's El Rancho,305,Always packed whenever I visit. Long wait. Parking is very crammed but if you order pick up there s designated parking at the front and they will bring it out to you. Last time I went inside it s super packed  Sunday evening  and 99  of the people weren t wearing masks or distancing. Surprised to see people so dressed up to go eat Mexican food lol  but I guess it s a place to be seen. Food is good  but overpriced. I guess it s on par with dining in downtown Austin. Building is beautiful  historical spanish architecture.
Matt's El Rancho,306,Jerry  amp  Kat  on my birthday. Went to Matt s at 5 30  perfect service by Maria Ramos  best ever. And I ve been going to Matt s for 50 years. Wonderful TexMex and superb service. Very COVID-19 safe.
Matt's El Rancho,307,AWFUL SERVICE. We showed up with a group of 8 and was told we can be sat if the entire party arrived within 10 minutes. We all walked in with 10 minutes before they closed and they said we could not be sat. The manager came out and said no as well. All employees didn t know what to say because they weren t even closed. This has happened more than once for us.
Matt's El Rancho,308,It takes a lot for me to give low ratings  but this time ugh. We had an hour wait for a table  no biggie really. But when our table was ready they almost didn t sit us because our whole party wasn t there. We explained that they were trying to find a parking spot and eventually they lead us to our table.  Service was subpar and slow. The only good thing were their drinks. The food was okay  but definitely have had better.  And then when we got the check they didn t separate it  and when asked they said no they can t do it because it takes too long.  IF we do come back it will only be for the drinks.
Matt's El Rancho,309,Charging for  package  materials is sus. What s next  A table cleaning fee  Cash grabs are not ok. Not stating it with any receipt is even worse. I expect better from them.
Matt's El Rancho,310,Again not disappointed it is as close to my Moms cooking as possible. The food is spiced just right the retried beans are the best in Austin.  Yes I will be back cause it just good. Food and good drinks Hot Diggity
Matt's El Rancho,311,3.5. I ve lived in Austin almost 20 years but just went to Matt s El Rancho this weekend    We went with a group of 7 Plus toddler and they accommodated us right away on the patio under the awning. It was a great location to enjoy the weather but not have to beat the sun.   Table wasn t cleaned when we sat down and I had to ask the hostess to clean it for us.   The chips and salsa are so good  I think they make the chips in house as they were crunchy  not too greasy and large. The salsa was smooth and just the right amount of spice and flavor.   I wasn t in the mood to eat a traditional dish  so I had the breakfast plate which had two eggs  over easy at my request   bacon  sausage and potatoes. This dish hit the spot  Bacon was crunchy and delish  The sausage was well prepared and the potatoes were mixed in with some peppers to give it color and texture.   Overall  the service was good  my dish was great  and I ll be back.
Matt's El Rancho,312,I started coming to Matt s El Rancho in August of 1992 when I arrived in Austin for grad school. Back then it was a treat we saved up for and it never disappointed. Now  27 years later it is still a treat that I enjoy with the same grad school friends. For the past 24 years I have been vegetarian. The staff at Matt s is always willing to accommodate any special requests and has not once made me feel like it was a burden. Matt s has been - and will continue to be - my favorite comfort food in  Austin. Bring on the spicy salsa   Note to the vegetarians out there  even the main entrees like the El Rancho Salad and the  1 Dinner are simple to make vegetarian. Sub out the beef taco for the whole beans. However  the Spinach Poblanitas really are a standout.
Matt's El Rancho,313,First time try this place after my friend recommended us to check this out. Foods are good. We re happy what we had. I had my chicken quesadilla and I cant finish whole thing.   Parking lot was full that it took us awhile to find empty to park.   More than that  i would recommend anyone to check this place out    
Matt's El Rancho,314,Food was on point. We had the grilled redfish and the chicken tortilla soup. I never order fish at a Mexican restaurant but decided to here and I m glad I did. The fish was cooked perfectly - it was tender  flavorful  and flaky  The chicken tortilla soup was also packed with flavor and a really big portion. Great service. We sat under the covered patio which was empty when we arrived. As we were leaving  we had to walk through the inside of the restaurant and were shocked to see so many people packed inside during Covid. Crazy to see this with cases so high. We felt safe on the patio which was good.
Matt's El Rancho,315,Blah.....  4 decades of patronizing Matt s and after the last 2 visits I might skip a decade.  The last time 6 months ago was a disaster. Salsa with no chips  fajita nachos with salad type multi-colored thick cut peppers  spinach enchiladas sans spinach  on and on and on. We vowed to not come back for a long time.  But we did  6 months later. Today  floor covered in food and trash we had to insist to be cleaned. Numerous flies landing on our food and us the entire meal. It was not as bad as last time and the servers seemed to be trying harder but....the steak tampiquena had those salad peppers all over it. I asked for chiles and received some authentic Serranos. The cheese in the enchiladas is unmeltable like plastic. I sent it back to be reheated and nothing changed. It was hot and unmelted.  At this point I think I am done with Matt s for a long time. This is sad especially since it is walking distance from my house.  Chips  salsa  Bob Armstrong  margaritas  everything else at your own risk 
Matt's El Rancho,316,Have dined in many times and the food and service is always good. Just ordered food online for curbside pick up and was impressed by the checklist to ensure all food was in the bag. Will definitely order online for curbside again 
Matt's El Rancho,317,Been coming to this place for years and have never been disappointed   I ve sent everyone here and no complaints   Love the brisket tacos-savory  moist and full of flavor also came with charro beans but I prefer refried- taste authentic  Bob Armstrong Dip- has queso  ground beef and quac.. Total yumness   I usually take pics of my plate   1 2 done  amp  realized it  Sorry  But I did get the menu   Oh my Frozen Strawberry Margarita.. always delicious on hot day  
Matt's El Rancho,318,Great food  great service.  Highly recommend the Chile rellenos  Bob queso dip and El Ranchorita   Both of our sons love the asadero tacos. We ve been coming here for over 30 years and love it 
Matt's El Rancho,319,Food was amazing. Never had Mexican food in Austin before. I am also picky when it comes to flan. Their flan was full of flavor and was creamy. Sooooo good. Would come here again. Our server was Abby and she was the best.
Matt's El Rancho,320,Tonight was our first time at Matt s since moving to Austin from Houston almost two years ago. The restaurant itself is nice and the ambience is great  especially for families with little ones. We were seated quickly and accommodated with high chairs. Chips and salsa were out quickly- chips were large and thicker than most  facilitating my large salsa scoops  mildly spicy  pretty good flavor .  Unfortunately  things went downhill after the pleasantries. Frozen margs were watered down  to the point we could barely taste the lime  which is a shocker at  10 a pop for a flute. The waitress said they re known for their fajitas  so we ordered for the table. Tried a piece of beef plain and was shocked at how unseasoned it was  compared to Lupe s and El Tiempo at least . The condiment bowl had barely anything in it  again a disappointment relative to Tex-Mex peers.  Needless to say  we don t plan on coming back- I d rather sit in the Friday s-like atmosphere of Lupe s or brave the crowds at Chuy s.
Matt's El Rancho,321,I ve been coming here since I was too small to see in their kitchen window. I love this place  I have to say that both Micah and Zayra are incredible and totally deserve a free shift meal  Thanks for always being a great spot.
Matt's El Rancho,322,This is a huge place  which may be offputting to some  but when a restaurant s been around since the 50 s and people keep flocking to eat there  it takes alot of room to feed them all. Beware the very narrow parking spaces  but inside  even big groups can comfortably spread out. We started off with the Bob Armstrong queso. And  based on and insider tip from a regular  we asked for it with brisket. Then we loaded up our plates with chips and drizzled the queso con brisket all over instead of dipping. Best way to eat. Pairs perfectly with house margaritas  frozen or on the rocks. Follow up with Chicken enchiladas verdes topped with a dollop of sour cream  comes with a scoop of guacamole on the side  and you won t be disappointed. Rice and refried beans round out the plate. So right  So good  This is real Tex-Mex 
Matt's El Rancho,323,I give Matts 5 stars bc what would you give YOUR church    It s not perfect. I have learned this over many years of much trial and error. But  I have worked my way through the menu so that you may all REJOICE   -knockout  Mexican martini - add a splash of strawberry if you can t hang w the tang  -bob  add extra beef      -asadero tacos  PROTIP  add grilled garlic and jalape os    -grilled tacos w brisket  -cheese enchiladas -tres leches cake  trust me - better than the basic af sopaipilla    I wish they d change their chips. But you know what  When you sit down at Matts - inside or out - with a knockout and a BOB  and the mariachi band strolls by - you know that you are HOME.   Closed on Tuesdays which on some Tuesdays you will soon learn is THE most devastating news you ve ever heard.
Matt's El Rancho,324,Great food the time in  amp  out was good but the food is the best.  Enjoyed the atmosphere  amp  seeing old friends thanks so much.  The margaritas were as good as always. I loved the chips best because I love chips  amp  butter
Matt's El Rancho,325,Nicely decorated  food was mediocre. I asked our waiter for tobacco sauce and he stated that it would take him 10 minutes to find it  how rude AND I never received it  . I at least thought the food would have been more tasteful. I will not be returning.
Matt's El Rancho,326,i m three margs deep writing but overall lovely food. only complaint was the weak burrito  looks way more like a single enchilada. although our waters were not refilled a single time despite all 4 being empty. my friends and I got the brisket tacos and fish tacos and loved it. menu looked like it gave a wide variety and some items sounded very enticing. would love to come again and try some other stuff. my tastebuds are wet af. we got the veggie queso and that shiiii was a 11 10. first time here and the spicy margs alone will make me return.
Matt's El Rancho,327,Ay carumba  Me gustan margaritas  Met the parents in Austin late Friday night and knew that we were all hungry. Lucky for us our Air bnb was right next to this hot ticket of a place  So many people were raving about this place and we were just lucky enough to be a walk away  Walked on in on a busy Friday night and had a wait of about 15-20 minutes...not so bad for a Friday  We sat down and although it was quite loud were able to have some good conversation. We ordered chips  amazing queso  and salsa of course  How did we all wash it down you ask  We ordered margaritas  I went with the sangria margarita and didn t have a single regret. Food orders around the table were chicken enchiladas  a chicken burrito  and chicken fajitas. Looks like we all like chicken huh  Smiles also went around the table because the food was so good  Portion size was great  which left no room for dessert. The waiter was very friendly and very efficient. Overall the experience was great and I think this might have been the best Mexican meal I ve had while I ve been in Texas  big shoes to fill I know  
Matt's El Rancho,328,Pretty tasty Tex-Mex. I had to wait like 30 minutes to be seated  which is longer than I like to wait  but the food was good and the service was good. I d definitely go back 
Matt's El Rancho,329,The most impressive parts of Matt s El Rancho are how they can attend to so many customers with quick service and friendly attitudes. The food  however  was below average. I wasn t expecting greatness and yet was still feeling  meh  with the quality of the food. It just feels so strange to hit up a place like Matt s and not feel that you can at least get average out of the food. However  the crowds still show up and the place is always packed. So take it all with a grain of sea salt.
Matt's El Rancho,330,This place is well worth the visit for any Tex-Mex lover. They serve with giant tortilla chips the size of your hand  which seem to be made in house. Grab a chip  break a piece  and dip into their medium spicy salsa  and chat away with a friend of the assortment of menu options to choose from. I ended up ordering a beef quesadilla and my friend got the beef fajitas. Our food arrived in under 15 minutes and looked very appetizing. I we had giant versions of any Tex-Mex food you get outside of those walls. I could  only finish half of my quesadilla plate. My friend did not want to deal with leftovers and ate his entire plate despite the large portion.  The only downside  a small downside  was our lack of enthusiasm from our waiter  but sometimes people may have those kinds of days. Overall  we were very pleased and will be coming back after one of our greenbelt climbing sessions.
Matt's El Rancho,331,I m still not quite sure why this is considered a staple restaurant of Austin. I ve been here a few times now  and every single time I ve been slightly disappointed. The food is just not that good  There s always a long wait and it always seems a bit chaotic inside. Our waitress this time was great  so I was really happy with that. However   I don t think I ve ever had such terrible carne guisada... The drinks are mediocre  the rice  beans  and tortillas are mediocre...I just don t understand why I keep getting dragged here lol
Matt's El Rancho,332,If I could give zero stars I would.   I ve never started a review by saying that. I m still in shock quite frankly.   We met on a Monday night with some friends who s sibling and significant other were in town from out of state visiting.   Everyone ordered food besides us  we had already eatin. It was a table of 8.   We  me and my boyfriend  ordered 2 shots each  and 3 margaritas each. A total of 4 shots and 6 margaritas.  I expected the bill to be something around  75-90  Wait for it...    233  What the actual             We ordered shots of Avion silver  which when you google it says it s  40 a bottle. I m beyond upset. Never in my life have I experienced anything like this. I ll be calling the manager in the morning.   It said market price... like what  Is this lobster  Halibut  No it s tequila and if you plan on charging  30 per ounce you need to make sure your customers are aware of this.    UPDATE    I spoke with a manger Blaine who was very nice and professional. He spoke with the waitress about it and concluded it was a mistake. He s going to refund  100 which is appreciated. However  we were still charged the 18  included gratuity because we were a party of 8 and were still left with a grand total of  130 for 4 shots and 6 margaritas. I usually tip 20  minimum but this was a big mistake and she still gets 18 . Something is better than nothing. I MIGHT go here again for drinks during happy hour Only and to try their food.
Matt's El Rancho,333,Ok so I ve eaten a lot of Mexican food in Austin over the past 5 years. My personal favorite is Matt s El Rancho. Everything from their fantastic lunch specials and entrees that are meant for sharing. This place deserves 5 stars  The house margaritas are muy delicioso and strong like how I like it.   Pros  Great food  and drinks. Free parking and plenty of it.  Cons   The only con that isn t a con is that I wish there was one that was closer to downtown Austin. I don t think that is something I can change though. Overall  this place is great 
Matt's El Rancho,334,Came here last week for hubby s birthday. It was a Tuesday night and we got there pretty early so no wait but only because we agreed to sit outside. It s August in Texas so you know what that meant. We have been here a few times and always get the same thing. The fajitas here are excellent  We got the queso to start and it was terrible. Concession stand queso. It was either leftover and warmed up when we ordered it or just a bad batch. So I don t recommend that. We always ask for garlic with our fajitas and they neber skimp on that it s so good   We did the chicken and steak fajitas with flour tortillas and it s so flavorful and delicious. The only thing i will say is there was barely any shredded cheese. And our server never came back so we could ask for more. Not sure if it s a COVID-19 thing but they have no draft beers. So we didn t end up drinking at all. I would love to come back and sit on the patio when it isn t sweltering outside because they have a really cute patio.
Matt's El Rancho,335,Overall experience was nice food was yummy. Waitress had a crappy attitude and was about as accommodating as a rock.  Left a 10 pct tip.  I always leave at least 20.
Matt's El Rancho,336,I first ate at this place in 1995 and have been coming back since then.  Over that time  the local feel and grand Texas history  that appealed to me  has faded. Taking its place is mediocre service  warm  not hot  food and institutional quality. This isn t about  a visit . Today was just the day my wife and I said  Matt s has changed. Time to move on .
Matt's El Rancho,337,We are in town from Houston and was looking for more authentic restaurant. The reviews was good so we checked this place out. They were taking all safety precautions. The food was sooooo good. The salsa had a kick to it with deep fried tortillla chips. I got the chicken quesadilla that was different from what I m use to and I loved it. My husband got the enchiladas and was very pleased with his meal. We also got the Bob Armstrong...just get it is all I can say. We had one strong martini too. You can t get more than two is all I can say.
Matt's El Rancho,338,Great tex mex. They have pretty good service  massive portions and that nice homemade feel to their food. Highly recommend if you re in the mood.  Bob Armstrong dip is the way to go for appetizers. Their chips are fresh  thick and crunchy and go well with the salsa or the meaty queso. Love how its served in a stone bowl to keep it warm for a bit. Salsa has just the right amount of kick to keep your taste buds interested.  They have a lot of lunch specials and settled on chicken fajita with flour tortillas. They have very good  fresh homemade flour tortillas - thicker  with a pleasant chew which stands well to the filling. The chicken is well flavored though could be a bit juicier  but nothing some sour cream and pico can t fix. The refried beans and rice round out the meal. They give you a lot of tortillas with your order  so you ll definitely have some leftover. Portioning it out right you ll easily make 5 tacos so leftovers to go. Can only fathom what the dinner portion is like.  Huge venue too  so if you got a large group Matt s El Rancho makes the perfect el party-o.
Matt's El Rancho,339,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE THAT RESULTED IN INJURY.  The man serving our food reached over the table and tipped sizzling fajita juice on one member of our parties leg. This resulted in burns on her legs. As a result we got a manager that brought us burn cream  and a response saying  things happen  and our fajitas covered but no other food or drinks covered or compensation.  If the burn gets any worse we will have to go to the doctor  and will be pressing charges.  Teach your staff how to carry fajitas and learn how to compensate massive mistakes properly. RIDICULOUS and extremely UNPROFESSIONAL.  Don t go unless you want hot fajita juice spilled on you and employees and managers who don t care.
Matt's El Rancho,340,Their recommendations for drinks were awesome   12 for one of the strongest I ve had and my date and I ended up just eating a large chips and queso for our dinner. Super nice server and massive amounts of parking around.
Matt's El Rancho,341,I ve been coming here lately and getting their soup and salad combo that they have for lunch. The chicken tortilla soup is absolutely delicious  and perfect for a cold day. The side salad is wonderful and a good portion. It s not boring  it comes with bell pepper  avocado and cabbage  among the usual stuff. If there s one improvement  I think it would be with the child and salsa. The chips are those too thick kind. And the salsa is a chunky  spicy thing. Anyway  this is becoming a regular spot for me.
Matt's El Rancho,342,Five of us had dinner here Saturday January 30th. Everything was so delicious   In my opinion  people should ignore every questionable review and go for your self. Not only was the food great but so were the drinks and service.
Matt's El Rancho,343,The Asadero tacos are  one of the 120 tacos you must eat before you die .  They were so good  I could die now  but I still have 119 left. Seriously good stuff  Also  wash it down with a Mexican martini. Great service  also 
Matt's El Rancho,344,Had a fabulous dinner here on a Friday night and this place is pumpin  with a 45 minute wait. The parking was horrendous  hence the 4 stars  I ended up moving a traffic cone to park in the valley area and the guys were accommodating and did t give me any issues and waived the valet fee. Atmosphere  food and drinks were great. I ordered the Tex mex dinner  the taco reminded me more of a loaded tostada without beans- bending it in half to eat was likely to break the shell but none the less it had plenty of flavor and the green enchiladas  tomatillo sauce  were superb. I would recommend taking your Pepcid before hand
Matt's El Rancho,345,I ordered Carne Guisada. Nothing to write home about  but  worth writing about here. The service was actually really great. And others at my table loved their chicken al carbon. The queso was also something they really liked. I didn t have the queso myself  so that is second hand knowledge.   Honestly though  my serving size was small for the price  so were the other portions ordered. It was a regular carne guisade  it hadn t stewed long enough  so the beef wasn t very tender and the flavor wasn t developed. The tortillas were great  Could definitely tell they were fresh and they tasted great because of it.  Didn t really get much worth the entree  no rice or beans  so it really was lacking and one note.   All in all  I wouldn t recommend this place based on my food.
Matt's El Rancho,346,Underwhelmed for sure. Food network recommended disappointment  server had no knowledge of the difference between a martini and a margarita. Ordered a margarita  got a martini...I hate vermouth. Cheese dip tasted like it came from a can. Chips hard. Ordered fajitas...Tortillas hard   Ate across the street the night before at Gourdough s Public House. It s a million times better. Save your money.
Matt's El Rancho,347,Okay. If you are in Austin  you need to go to Matt s El Rancho. We had the best dinner Friday night with a group of 7.   It is everything you want and need in a Tex Mex spot. Great outdoor seating  great service  the best queso  get the one with black beans    Texas Martinis  and delicious fajitas  with fresh tortillas     For sure make a reservation if you are coming on the weekends.   Can t wait to go back next time I am in town 
Matt's El Rancho,348,Wow  This has been the best Mexican food I have had in a long time. My husband and I both enjoyed our meals and I can t wait to go back and try more things.
Matt's El Rancho,349,My favorite place to take when family or friends come into town  or a good date night. The food  drinks  and service is great. My favorite is the shrimp quesadilla. Parking lot is huge too so never an issue.
Matt's El Rancho,350,Heather as a waitress is unparalleled service. A queen by every standard. If she doesn t get a raise after the service  food  entertainment she provided then the establishment is doing her wrong. Best waitress I ve ever had and I hope management sees this 
Matt's El Rancho,351,I ve seen reviews that this is the top Tex-Mex spot in Austin.  Maybe 20 years ago  but not any more.  What you ll get is assembly line Mexican food served by overworked waiters.  I can remember the original Matt s on I-35 and it really was great. Even for the first few years in the current location  it was very good.  Now  its just a tourist destination with expensive  generic Tex Mex.  Austin has so many better choices.
Matt's El Rancho,352,Horrible experience there tonight  The manager threw us out after his hostess was terribly rude to us. My 80 year old mother that can t see hardly I was escorting in because it was starting to rain  amp  was getting very cold outside standing in line. My daughter who lives in Austin told us to go inside while she puts our name in. When we entered the hostess was extremely rude saying   u need to pull your mask up  I said oh sure I m sorry .  my elderly mom sat down  amp  I had my arm wrapped in hers...so I sat down beside her the hostess said y all need to go back outside  amp  wait. My mother said I m cold  amp  it s raining can I sit here until my daughter comes in here  She said No you need to go outside  I said my mother is tired  amp  80 yrs old she can t see good  amp  so can we wait here  there is no one else in here. All the seats were empty. She again wouldn t leave us alone  amp  said you have to go back outside    So I said do you really have to be such a bitch  My daughter is about to come inside here. The manager came over  amp  yelled for us to leave his restaurant. He wouldn t listen to anything we had to say. He said if you called my hostess a bitch u leave now. We had driven 30 minutes to get there    amp  was excited to be in Austin visiting my daughter. We had circled around trying to find a parking place for a while  amp  My mom 80 yrs old was tired  amp  cold. It was raining  amp  he threw us 3 women out . No apology  amp  didn t ask our version of the story. He was so rude. We just went home sick in disbelief. We absolutely had our night ruined. Never will we ever be back there. The worst customer service I ve ever seen. We own a business  amp  believe the customer comes first. At list listen to what happened.  Whoever the hostess was on tonight April 15th  at-around  6 00 pm  amp  the big guy manager are awful.
Matt's El Rancho,353,I always judge a mexican restaurant by the quality of the tortillas and Margaritas and they have amazing food and drinks  I love their Brisket tacos and Chile Relleno. My husband s name is Matt so we always love coming here. They have been located on S Lamar for so long and never disappoint.
Matt's El Rancho,354,very old place with cool scene..queso was outstanding..food was fine...lots go there...
Matt's El Rancho,355,First of all  let me say that I m not a fan of Tex Mex  but was told by a local that this was the place to go for Tex Mex...so  I decided to be open-minded and see how good Tex Mex can be.  Spoiler alert  not very  based on this place.   Second  this place is apparently super popular and gets really busy. Get here early  no wait at 5 30 on a Saturday  but it was starting to be busy for sure . Note that they don t seat you until the whole party is present  and they don t split checks.  The waiter recommended Tacos Al Carbon   14.95   so I went with that  beef tenderloin tacos in flour tortillas  with some sides . The meat was decent  but I was less than impressed...it was not memorable  and I would not recommend this place.  If you re a fan of Tex Mex maybe you d like it more than me  but I honestly couldn t distinguish this place from a Chevy s.  My friends did say that the queso was good  but I m not a fan of queso. 
Matt's El Rancho,356,Best Tex-Mex in Austin  hands down. Great house margaritas. The chips are freshly fried tortillas and the beef fajitas are a must.  Their Bob s quest is great.  Always busy - expect a wait  well worth it.
Matt's El Rancho,357,Nope.  Can t figure out why people go here.   Want a good taco  Go to Papalote Taco House just down Lamar.  3 types of salsa they make themselves.  Now that s good Mexican food 
Matt's El Rancho,358,Horrible horrible service.  Meh food.  Went there with three friends last night  and service and wait times were aweful. Waiter could never be found  food took forever  and to top it off the only hot sauce they had was tobacco.  Really    
Matt's El Rancho,359,Great Tex-Mex spot  Started off with the Bob Armstrong queso which was absolutely delicious- very creamy and not salty. There was a mix of their black beans with guacamole which worked well. I ended up getting combo platter with a chicken taco  enchiladas and spanish rice and refried beans. I m not a fan of enchiladas but this was absolutely delicious...very flavorful  cheesy  with tender chicken pieces. The rice wasn t overcooked and  seasoned well. The refried beans were good too.   We didn t eat beef and specified to the waiter but twice our dishes had beef in it. Once pointed out it was quickly rectified.
Matt's El Rancho,360,I am normally crazy excited to go and eat and drink at Matt s  been going there since I was 15 years old.   I have to say  i am dissapointed that every other restaurant that has a bar has opened all of their bar seating  except Matt s.   I normally eat alone  so it does not make sense for me to get a table or take someone who needs the table away.    City of Austin has not restrictions on allowing bar seating.   Que paso      
Matt's El Rancho,361,Lixy was a waitress today 7-28-19 around 4 30. She didn t stagger our food. We received cold food .  Received gristle meat in  meat with the tacos that were cold. Got our drinks same time too  Like really should of been out earlier    Queso was cold    She had a attitude  omg this staff  and the  ugh I m tired  the manager came over.  The manager gave us only free queso to help with this crappy service. Oh and lixy rushes us out. We were still eating and she gave us the cheek. Um what if we wanted desert   Yeah thanks for the free cold queso.  Watered down drinks too   Update  we told the manager. All we got to make up for the crappy service was free queso.  The manager  was well aware of what was going on and just gave free queso to make up for it.  It was cold queso.  Yeah great way making up crappy service. I will spreading this around to all social media since you the general manager do not care how customers are treated.
Matt's El Rancho,362,Don t believe the hype from negative reviews I come from Manhattan where there s plenty of Mexican food to compare and this place beats most of if not all of those. Outstanding enchiladas and fajitas. All around authentic and again it s all about the food  excellent. Similar to the Carnegie deli of Mexican food. Great staff and customer service. A must when in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,363,Got to the restaurant and although they had a private parking lot  it was packed.  Circled a few times and finally found a spot.   The wait for a table was very long so we sat that the outside bar in the back.  Started with the Bob Armstrong Dip which probably the best part of the meal.  I ordered the shrimp alla Matt Martinez although shrimps were large they were a bit over cooked and the flautas were too oily.   The bartender was attentive so made up for the average meal.
Matt's El Rancho,364,I came in with my coworkers for a Friday lunch- it was great  I started off with the sangria margarita and it was tasty. It s served frozen and I was happy that it didn t have that syrupy  overly sweet taste that some frozen margaritas have. We also ordered the queso and I have to admit  it might be the best queso I ve tried in Austin so far. It was thick  slightly spicy  and tasted homemade. The tortilla chips were good too    For my meal  I tried the asadora tacos and the serving size was big and very filling. The beef tenderloin was a bit chewy but it was well seasoned.  Overall  I enjoyed my time here and I ll be back for more drinks and queso  
Matt's El Rancho,365,One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. The downside is you cannot make reservations and typically the hour is about an hour but worth it and you can order drinks while you wait. They have lots of options  food is yummy and affordable. They do have self parking and valet options.
Matt's El Rancho,366,I absolutely love this restaurant  but unfortunately the one star review sticks with our experience last night. This is probably the 50th time we ve been and I have never been treated the way we were last night.   I ordered the beef quesadillas as my entree. Our server  I don t remember his name sadly  was incredibly kind. It was busy as usual but he was still great.  The food runner was so  so incredibly rude. I don t know his name but he has shoulder length brunette hair that is all slicked back with gel or something similar.   He came to our table with only one plate. And simply said  Beef . I thought oh that s probably my dish  and if not we can switch it. He sets it down and it was beef nachos  not beef quesadillas. So I say  Oh I ordered the beef quesadillas.  The food runner goes  Oh.  Gives me a dirty look and immediately goes to grab the plate. I felt bad  so I said  I didn t touch it though   Thinking maybe if anything someone else could eat it.   He said  It doesn t matter I have to throw it away now.    I was shocked and wasn t even able to respond before he turned to our server who was at the next table and said  very loudly   She ordered the nachos but NOW she wants quesadillas.    He made me sound like this stuck up brat who simply changed her mind when she saw the plate. Which by the way  is not what happened AT ALL. The server came back and apologized profusely for entering the wrong entree in. It didn t bother me at all  literally was not upset or mad or anything even close. I was a server for years  I know what it s like. I honestly would have even just eaten the nachos too  if he wasn t such a jerk and walked away before I could respond.   As I said  our server was so great on the patio  I really wish I remember his name. I plan on returning to speak with management about this behavior.   Food was amazing as always  all other service was fantastic  We love it here 
Matt's El Rancho,367,It s really not great.  There is always a wait on weekends. Go early    Good luck getting in here during one of Austin s many event nights. This place gets packed fast and sometimes getting to the bar for a drink while waiting can be a tricky experience.   Service is a highlight here  even when it s packed they are very nice and attentive and the food is served lighting fast. Can t complain one bit about this.   The drinks  well they are just ok  typical bar mix tasting margaritas  nothing to write home about.   The food is also just ok  kinda bland basic Tex mex cuisine. Their tortillas are really good but everything inside of them is just boring.   There is really good Mexican food in Austin and this place is kind of just a big tourist stop for people visiting. It s ok  but there is definitely better.
Matt's El Rancho,368,One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. Best Mexican martinis and great service. Lixy was our waitress today and she was the BEST. She knew all the details on the menu and treated us like family.   She knew all the vegan options on the menu 
Matt's El Rancho,369,Was asked to leave because I had my service animal I had all of her current paperwork but they do not view my disability as a real one. Can t believe they choose to be an anti dog and anti Austin establishment. Brett the manager was rude and illegally asked me how I was disabled I will never be returning
Matt's El Rancho,370,Out of all the times I ve been to Austin  this my my first real visit to Matt s El Rancho  Which is shocking since I m usually down on the local vibe  but yeah it finally happened. From what I can tell this spot is the go-to of local family dining. We went on a Sunday night and it was pretty much packed like a Friday or Saturday. The restaurant itself is huge  so the wait wasn t too long.   Of course as soon as we were sat  we got an order of their famous queso. But not just any queso  This queso was full of veggies and you guessed it Texas - Brisket   OMG  this stuff was legit. So much that I wanted to brisket-fy everything else in my order  luckily I restrained myself and just had it in the queso  but i gotta say  I bet it s slammin. Also  make sure to get the warm tortillas with said queso  it just adds to even more deliciousness.  We had a wide range of plates so i got to try quite a few things. Myself  I went for the stuffed chili relleno with beef  because Texas. This thing was so freaking huge that I didn t really even put a dent in it. My friend got the grilled fish something and it was actually incredible  so a bit of order envy there. My other friend got the chicken taco soup and that was freakin incredible also.   I ll make sure to hit them up again so I can get to try to the brisket in the tacos or enchiladas. I can only dream of how good that will be until then.
Matt's El Rancho,371,Do you like going to places where they cut you off after 3  small  margaritas and kick you out of your table after 2 hours...even if you re still trying to finish your drink  If so  go to Matt s   This place is to big for its britches  I just remembered why I haven t been back here in 15 years. There s a lot of other Mexican restaurants that treat you better and have good food.
Matt's El Rancho,372,Well that was incredibly disappointing    This is the story of why I will never have a large bob.  It was 72 degrees in Austin on a beautiful spring night after a storm. We were headed home  and after years of wanted to try this place  we popped in  1 hour before closing.   They seated us in a large dining room. There were 2-3 large parties  but still only about half full. It was sooo noisy  and the blasting AC made it uncomfortably cold.   After being seated  a nice man walked up and greeted us. We asked him if we could sit on the patio. He said absolutely  He handed us our menus  and said you can sit wherever you like. Just go up to the hostess stand and let them know so they can seat you again.   We grabbed our menus and walked up front. The hostess told us the patio was closed.   WAIT WHAT  72 degrees. Beautiful spring night. 9 pm. Lovely patio... And the patio is closed   In 15 years in Austin I VE NEVER BEEN TOLD A PATIO WAS CLOSED   We went back to sit down  and the same kind gentleman walked up to us again. We told him what happened  and he again insisted we could sit wherever we wanted. So he grabbed our things again  and began walking outside towards the patio. It was immediately far more pleasant. We sat down at a table and began looking over the menu. There were a lot of people on the patio  at all stages of the dining process.   After a few minutes  another waiter walked up to us and said I m sorry you can t sit here  this section is closed. We went back inside... And again it was cold and noisy  and very unpleasant   The waiter took our drink order  which we actually placed the first time we sat down... this was our 3rd time   and I asked to speak to a manager. A few minutes later someone brought a tiny bowl of salsa -- no chips.   We had no water. The drinks we ordered never showed up. And the manager was nowhere in sight.   We were 20 minutes into it now... and decided we were done.  We got up and walked to the front  and asked to speak to a manager again.  After several minutes  the manager finally came out.  We told him the story and he started arguing with us that the patio was closed  that things had slowed down  and they closed that section.    Having worked in a restaurant for 5 years  and eaten out a lot both in Austin  and all over the world  I ve never been treated this way  and we certainly never treated anyone this way when I was working in a restaurant.  If we were slow  a customer could sit anywhere. The staff adjusted and worked it out. Period. No questions. And you never close a beautiful patio when the weather is amazing    We shared our experience with the manager  and after arguing a bit more with us  and defending their position  he finally agreed to seat us on the patio. Sadly  we were done...  We asked about the owner  and learned they are elderly and no longer involved with the restaurant.   They have all these awards on the wall  a big sign out front  and they can t keep a patio open on a night like this   This is not the Austin I know  This is not a place I want to promote.   What an awful experience.
Matt's El Rancho,373,Arrived on a Saturday at 12 15. Party of 12. Only waited for about 10 mins after quoted 15 mins at host stand. They text you when when your table is ready. It was quick. Guests get to see the grill while waiting. Gentlemen behind the grill were very nice and waved. All proteins were kept cold and it looked like food safety protocols were in place. Saw French fries being folded into some onions and jalepeno peppers on the grill. Don t know what that was but it looked great.   Once we got to the table  server was very nice and all items drinks were brought quickly. No auctioning of food or drinks. Appreciated that. In the area we were placed  we were a little close to other tables  but didn t feel it. I felt for the food runners though.   Bob queso was great. Hot and smooth with beef and avo. Plates were brought out hot. Beer was cold. Rice was great and combined with the beef enchilada sauce  even better.   Restrooms were busy and well used. Prob need bigger ones.   Outside area with bar looked nice. 50s outside so the plastic was up.   Bar area was busy. Looked fun.   If in Austin again soon and looking for great Mexican food  we will return 
Matt's El Rancho,374,Good afternoon.   Let me start by saying I have been a fan of Matt s since I ate with his family at the East 1st  Now Cesar Chavez  location.   He  then  and his family now have always been great hosts.  Today  I had an entirely foreign experience that I can t imagine they would tolerate.   I ordered lunch for my wife who works about 3 blocks from your restaurant.  Over 50 dollars for lunch but its Matt s and worth it  in the past .  It was late  it was cold  and it was missing food for her lunch.  I called the restaurant and the staff who answer the phone were professional  patient  and attentive.  I was passed on to the Manager Aaron  Forgive if spelling is incorrect.  He was short  rude  and hung up on me.  I called back and he continued to be rude and couldn t care less about customer service.  He blamed the delivery service and took no responsibility for the missing food order until confronted about it.    I asked to speak to one of the family  owners  and he said he would not pass my concerns to any of them.  He said he would pass my message to the General Manager but not any of the family.   After 40 plus years of eating at Matt s we say goodbye  with fond memories of Matt..
Matt's El Rancho,375,I ve been going to Matt s since the 70 s  amp  the food is almost always great but I can t say the same for  yesterday evening. I ordered the Asadero tacos which are supposed to be beef tenderloin but the meat but tough as leather. I mentioned this to our server  amp  it was an  oh well  attitude. I don t know what we ll be back.
Matt's El Rancho,376,Well...I ve lived in ATX all my life. I can say  Matt s was a staple of many of my childhood family memories. We always had fun. The food used to be better  but in general  has stayed reasonably consistent. As Austin has grown  there is now much better Tex Mex  but in its day  Matt s was a sure thing.    I miss Matt. I don t know if you have been keeping track of the holding company s litigious behavior. Apparently  they can t make enough money taking advantage of tourists with sub par Tex Mex. They need to go after Matt s friends for  trademark infringement  trademark dilution  and unjust enrichment   for queso w  quac and taco meat    Are you kidding me    Focus on your product and your service. Leave Matt and his friends alone.   NeverComingBack
Matt's El Rancho,377,Best Enchiladas I ve had in Austin. The drinks need a little work  however the food usually makes me forget there s anything else on the table.
Matt's El Rancho,378,Ok first off I m pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food and drinks but this place WAS LEGIT  the house margaritas were superb and that SALSA....I wanted to take a bowl home    It was spicy but bearable. I ordered the fish tacos. Tortillas was cooked perfectly and the the sauce for it was soooo good  Pretty Busy for a Wednesday night but worth the short wait.
Matt's El Rancho,379,Great consistent food and drinks   Not seating incomplete parties doesn t make much sense in my opinion- frustrating as well. I would have ordered at least 2 drinks and app food before the rest of my party even arrived- more money for the restaurant in the long run they are missing out on. Not smart business.
Matt's El Rancho,380,I was trying to decide where to eat with my boys since my wife was out with her girlfriends. I like to read Yelp  and local reviews from the google  and Matt s was on the list of top Tex-Mex in town  so I decided we d try it.  The parking lot is quite large  but it was still packed. I did manage to find a spot without too much trouble. There is valet parking for  6  I think that s what the sign said  also. When you walk in there are 3 hostesses at an area just to your left when you walk in. Give them your cell on a busy night like Saturday night at 7 and they ll text you when your table is ready. She told me the wait was about 45 minutes  but it wasn t any more than 20. Plenty of space to wait we each had a chair to sit in. The restaurant is very well decorated. Feels like you step back into a Mexican ranch house. Some cool murals and adobe look make it an authentic feeling.  The chips and salsa were some of my favorite  I base my like of Tex-mex with their salsa and chips  and this was at least in the top 3  probably number one. I had read that the prickly pear margarita  Cactus Pryor was a must try. Since one of my most favorite memories of my childhood was my grandmother s homemade prickly pear jelly  I just had to try it. I m usually a beer guy  but their selection was too mainstream for me  so I went with the fruity drink and it did not disappoint  I had also read the Bob Armstrong queso was a must have  so we did. It was very tasty and a kid favorite as well. My main course was the beef enchiladas. They were some of the best I ve ever eaten. The kids shrimp plate was also a favorite for them. And you could tell it wasn t the cheap fried shrimp you seem to get at just about any place that serves fried shrimp for kids plates.  The service was also wonderful. We didn t want for anything. If I did ask it was promptly brought to the table. And they were extremely busy  so that s awesome that they paid so much attention to us despite being so busy. I liked it so much we went back  this time I brought my wife  for brunch. It s served Saturday and Sunday from 11am - 3pm. I ordered a large Bob this time  the kids got the shrimp again. I ordered a carne guisada burrito with grilled jalape os. It came with Mexican potatoes and refried beans. It was so good. My wife got 2 tacos with bacon egg and cheese. She only ate 1 1 2. She said next time she ll only order one.  This will be my go to place when I m in Austin. I love it  
Matt's El Rancho,381,Good food at this fam run rest. We tried the Armstrong dip  fish taco and steak asado tacos. For dessert tried the sopapilla. All good as authentic tasting.   Sat out by the pond watching some bad kids ripping apart the poor plant there while parents didn t take notice sadly. There were some smokers unfortunately but food was good.   It s a rest so pls make sure kids behave appropriately around guests and respect the rest itself.
Matt's El Rancho,382,Great patio and great service and the Bob Armstrong Dip  amp  Asadero Tacos are delish   Oh and the pineapple sherbet is nice and refreshing after a spicy meal in the warm sunshine.
Matt's El Rancho,383,I ve eaten here three times and it s always been delicious with good service and plenty of parking in the oversized lot. I love their Chile Relleno. I keep going back for that so I haven t tried much else except a bite off my companion s plate and that s always delicious. I ve also had a bite of dessert which was delicious.
Matt's El Rancho,384,The start was rough. We got here and it is super busy which is fine  but I gave my hostess my phone number which they ask for to text you when they are ready. I told her my number 4 times. 40 min. Later I went to check on how much longer it will be and found out they skipped us because she typed my number wrong so we had to wait again. When our text finally came the hostess ignored the fact that we we re standing in front of her. The cellphone system is dumb   If they had a keypad that allowed you to put in your own number they would have less errors.  We started off with the Bob Armstrong Queso which was quite delicious and I had to stop my self from eating all of it so I could eat my meal.  I ordered the beef fajitas and my brother got the famous tacos.  The fajitas were well seasoned and absolutely delicious. The tacos we re averaged and I would not add them to my bucket list.   The tres leches was of average quality. Overall an OK experience
Matt's El Rancho,385,First time here. Knew of the place due to the World Famous  Bob Armstrong Dip  boy this place delivers. There is a reason the dip is world famous. I had fajitas and they were amazing  Definitely worth your time to come here and visit the Texas Landmark 
Matt's El Rancho,386,Great  chile rellenos   My husband had the Asadero Tacos and really enjoyed his meal as well.
Matt's El Rancho,387,We had a great time here last night . The only negative was the hour wait. The quesadilla was the best we ever had served with warm tortilla chips. I had the steak fajitas which were also the best. My sons had the Brisket tacos which they loved.  Service was excellent and the restaurant was a little noisy but worth it for the quality of food.  We re from Florida visiting  so if your in town do yourself a favor and go here. We re going back there on this trip.
Matt's El Rancho,388,Great place  It feels really original. We were a group of 10 people and they sitted us almost right away even without reservation on Sunday noon. The service was great and fast. The queso was amazing and they kept bringing us tortilla chips until our food was served. Margarita is a must  Definitely going back next time i m in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,389,We decided to give this place another shot  even though our initial visit was subpar. We must have caught them on an off night prior  because this experience was a complete 180 from our first visit.  Our waiter  Marcello  was on top of everything  actively refilling waters  ensuring we always had chips  and checking in with us in a very timely manner. He was very informed on the menu  helpful at recommending some new dishes to try  and even threw in some homemade pralines to top off the wonderful evening. Maybe it was the great service  but the food seemed to taste a lot better than last time we were here a year ago too.   I m definitely looking forward to getting back here again soon  and we may finally found our go-to spot for Mexican close by. It s family friendly  and we don t feel guilty if our daughter launches a queso-covered crayon halfway across the room. Probably because some frat guy at the table nearby will just throw it back to her.
Matt's El Rancho,390,I ve been here multiple times and it never disappoints  The food  the drinks  the atmosphere you just can t beat it. Matt s EL Rancho is where it s at    I highly recommend this to anyone who comes to visit Austin Texas 
Matt's El Rancho,391,I do like the decor and ambience of this place. Margaritas are also good  and a mariachi band plays on some nights. However  I was a little disappointed that our group was seated in a back room area next to the kitchen where the band never played.   Food was decent- expect your average tex mex fare. I also don t get what all the hype is for the bob Armstrong dip. It s basically fake cheese with a scoop of guacamole and ground beef. The large bowl is also very deceiving as it is very shallow.  Our server was not excited to be out with a group of 8  but she did just fine with all of our demands. Overall a cool place to eat once  but not one to remember.
Matt's El Rancho,392,This used to be our favorite spot in ATX  Since Covid-19 hit it seems their quality of food took a dive. As I can only assume due to the pandemic. It s still good  but definitely not that write-home quality it used to be. Hopefully things get back to normal once this all blows over because this was the spot     Once they get their high-quality ingredients back we LOVED the Fajita Steak quesadillas  the Enchiladas and the Bob Armstrong Chili Queso is off the charts 
Matt's El Rancho,393,My daughter moved to Austin 2 months ago. It s my first time visiting her  and Texas  and your restaurant was the first place she took me to  Outstanding food and great atmosphere. We had the steak tacos and they were incredible 
Matt's El Rancho,394,Where do I start      This is my favorite Mexican food restaurant. Period.  The margaritas  Killer   Salsa  Killer   The food   The ambiance   All top notch     The hacienda style restaurant   amp  patio equipped with fountains and lively crowd make this my go to   Last time we were here the service  was awesome  they were so friendly and accommodating   our group had 3 kiddos under 3 years old  . I love Matt s el rancho  amp  always will 
Matt's El Rancho,395,Great outdoor patio  Drinks and appetizers w family on a Sunday afternoon. Micheladas.
Matt's El Rancho,396,DON T YELL AT MY GRANDPARENTS  The food was great  the service was near awful. Family drove in from Dallas and across TX for a graduation ceremony and we decided on Matt s El Rancho for dinner. We were told if we were there by 5 30 they would have a table for our party ready to go. It was a large party of 14 and we arrived within time. We waited an hour for our table and were seated outside in the back. No one came to apologize for the wait. No appetizers offered as compensation  but no one from the family was too upset. It s December so it can get cold and some of the older family members were asking if we could have the outdoor heater next to our table turned on. Our waitress said no.  We don t do that unless it s 60 degrees.   I went and found the manager and it s amazing what happens when you take the initiative to ask. We got heat and people weren t curled up in their coats. When our food arrived  the waitress didn t know who had what and my grandfather couldn t hear her and asked several times if the dish she was holding was his order. He got no response. The 3rd time he asked the waitress she snapped at him and said   I heard you  No  It s not   I know the service industry isn t easy  I ve done it myself  and a large party can be challenging. But never yell at a guest. My grandfather also insisted on paying as he was happy to see one of his grandsons graduate and the tab was at least  300.00  Again  our food was great  but the way we were treated was just wron. We weren t an overly demanding or drunk table so it baffles me why this was our experience.
Matt's El Rancho,397,Great fajitas   We split a combo steak and chicken.  The meats were tender and had great flavor.  They also come with a generous amount of grilled peppers and onions which were cooked just right   The chips and salsa were decent.  Chips were a little thick for my liking but still were good  Service was a little slow because they were very busy  Overall this is a solid spot to try in south Austin
Matt's El Rancho,398,TexMex from a former boxer.  This place is a long standing Austin original.  Overall  the food comes out quickly and it s pretty good.  Thick chips with your salsa  not thin ones .  The place is pretty big so it s definitely got room for large groups if you make some reservations.    Downsides - I keep trying to go there when the one day of the week they re closed.
Matt's El Rancho,399,If you have Corey as a server  RUN  He was awful and focused solely on the big tables and tourists. He forgot about us several times and even tried to joke about how bad his service was to us  compared to the tables around us. They have great food  but wow what a terrible experience.
Matt's El Rancho,400,You either die a hero  or live long enough to see yourself become a hoagie... Or a villain. I haven t seen Dark Knight in a while.  In either case  that s what comes to mind when I hear someone whine about Matt s  either over drinks  at an inevitably hipster-tastic coffee shop bar in East Austin   or on the Yelp.   It s normally one of three central beefs  the food is too bland  the place is too crowded  and the experience is simply too expensive.   Freud might diagnose these symptoms as part of his seldom-discussed theory of the  Successful Restaurant Complex.  Apparently  there s something that activates in our amygdalas when we see a local restaurant make good for so long that it becomes an institution. And you cannot be an institution and the cute local restaurant at the same time.  That cognitive dissonance causes us to irrationally tear down the very places we built.   Generations of satisfied customers have made Matt s what it is  a mom-and-pop gone big without ever leaving town. If you hate on Matt s  just remember that you would ve loved it if you lived here twenty years ago  or if it opened up tomorrow on Manor.  Why should you still love Matt s  Because  in my limited experience  it s consistently very good.   The fajitas sing the song of smoke and sizzle. The Knockout Martini s put fear in Trudy s heart. The tortillas  both flour and corn  are homemade. As are the badass giant  break-your-own chips tostadas.   The open kitchen indicates pride in their product and gives the inevitable line of devotees something to look at while they wait. And the service is unflappable  if overburdened with the aforementioned 500 humans descending upon this casa on a nightly basis.   Back to those three beefs   Is the food center of left  taste-wise  I mean  they re not hitting you with Yucatecan flavors or rosemary margaritas or tempeh guisada or anything your uncle from OKC would send back. It s definitely on the safer side  but that s the power of a proven recipe made for a wide audience. And those flavors are still bold  don t go comparing this to Mickey Ds  or even Chipotle. It s authentic Tex-Mex.   Is the place crowded  Absolutely. A bunch of people think it s good  and they ve thought that for a while. Tradition and crowds go hand-in-hand. That said  I like to get there early  we re talking 6pm or earlier  so that I basically don t have to wait.   Is the food expensive  Yeah  relatively. I mean  let it be known that fajitas everywhere cost money  and Matt s drink food prices are probably a standard deviation above the average Austin Tex-Mex-taurant. But that s also how a place stays in business 50  years  get what you can as long as the crowds keep coming. Would I rather it be cheaper  I d love if it were free. But property taxes on S Lamar is expensive  just ask the carousel of failed enterprises that is the Lamar Union   so maybe this all of us pitching in to keep one of Austin s oldest queso suppliers around.   It may not be the hippest or hottest place right now  but if we re looking at the last half-century of the Live Breakfast Taco Critic Capital of the World  Matt s might still truly be  The King of Tex-Mex. 
Matt's El Rancho,401,We had been to Matt s El Rancho a few years ago to celebrate one of our birthdays with a large group  but hadn t been back since. A friend from NYC wanted some Tex Mex  so we decided to take her here on Thursday night. We really like this place. Is it the best in town  No. But it s a festive atmosphere with decent servings.  We started with margaritas and the Bob Armstrong dip  of course    which we all loved  especially our daughter whose face looked like she had gone swimming in it. For dinner  one of us got the fish tacos with Mahi and the other got the famous asadero tacos. The fish was cooked well on the former dish  but there was literally nothing else inside the taco except for it. The asadero plate was more impressive with a nice grill and a ton of flavor. Sides were all good  but we especially enjoyed the beans.  Service was fine. Our only complaint about this place is that it s overpriced  there s nothing particularly special about Matt s other than its beloved local history  yet prices are almost 25  higher than other places of its ilk. Anyway  doesn t bother us much and we re happy to support them since we don t venture south that often and it feels like a special treat.
Matt's El Rancho,402,Went to this place specifically to try bobs Armstrong queso dip. It was guacamole and ground beef and tasted AMAZING  You can t go wrong with this. It was featured on the travel channel so it s a MUST have. I also had the strawberry margarita which was pretty good.  Tex mex burrito was pretty darn good too 
Matt's El Rancho,403,This is a very busy restaurant.  Though  it is busy...the service is quick and servers friendly and attentive.  We never ran out of water and that s a good thing being 95 degrees outside.  Outdoor seating was spacious and comfortable. The servings are plentiful and very tasty.  Our server was friendly  efficient  and always on the ball. Thank you for a great dinner.  Clean restaurant and energetic atmosphere.  The Mariachis were the topping on the cake   
Matt's El Rancho,404,From the margs to the  BoB  you can t skip this  must - try  Austin Tex Mex institution if you re in for the weekend or you live here in town. Portions are generous and the patio is amazing when the weather is nice  It s a time Honored Austin tradition and once you ve tried it  you will know why   
Matt's El Rancho,405,This is the second time we ve come to this resteraunt. The first time we came the food and service were great  Could ve easily given a 4-5 star review.  This time however the service was terrible  and the food wasn t very good. We re very dissapointed about this problem and hope it s fixed.   We may come back  but we re still not sure
Matt's El Rancho,406,I could tell this was an Austin institution as soon as I walked in the door  as there was a massive wait and the place smelled amazing. We were able to snag a few bar stools  which was fine by me. The margaritas were quite tasty  although I m glad I didn t get the margarita martini thing... not my thing  . However  the standout  of course  were my brisket flautas  Arguably the best tex-mex dish I ve ever tasted. Service was a bit slow due to the wait and crowds  but this had to be my favorite meal in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,407,Stopped here on a Friday night while passing through town  because I read it is rated in the top 10 Tex-Mex in Texas. We pulled in to see valet parking and people waiting outside. I was surprised to find that we were able to sit right away.  First warning  if you have braces be careful  the chips are thick and can pop a bracket. We ordered queso and the Bob queso. The Bob is I guess one thing that are known for  it was not bad. The regular queso was well bland and more like velveeta and some chilies. I had the chicken chili relleno lite  no batter  it was flavorful  wife had chicken flauntas.  Rice was ok. We must have not ordered the items that make this place in the top 10  we were not overly impressed  but it must be better than we think because it was packed. The fajitas must be one of those items because a lot of people were ordering it.
Matt's El Rancho,408,This place is enormous. but still expect to wait for a table. Because it is so huge it is also super loud and kid friendly. I came here on recommendation from a friend who used to live in Austin  it did not disappoint    The bob armstrong queso dip is something they are famous for  my personal opinion is  maso menos... I am not into the melted fake cheese. The salsa is SUPER spicy  but delicious. The steak fajitas are the BEST I have ever had  hands down. The meat is literally perfection. If you come here for anything  let it be the steak fajitas. We also ordered the green enchiladas  they were fresh and delicious  but again with the fake melted cheese. I would order this entree again  but ask for no queso.   The service was great and the food was also amazing. I would definitely recommend to a friend and visit again in the future 
Matt's El Rancho,409,One of my favorite Mexican places to take visitors and out of towners. Super authentic feel  and delicious Tex mex. it s a huge place so even on busy nights  the wait won t be too too long. Their salsa is absolutely delicious and make sure to get the  bob  which is their queso. Top 3 queso in Austin. A little disappointed that they stopped making their mole enchiladas  a personal favorite  but I still like their other menu items. Maybe the 5 star is a bit nostalgic but nonetheless  worth it  after the experiences I ve had here. Truly an Austin fixture
Matt's El Rancho,410,Cool location and decor  but mediocre food and service.  I went with a group during weekday lunch and our inattentive server didn t come by to greet us or take our drink orders until almost 20 minutes after we sat down.  Some in our group have been to this  Austin favorite  while the rest of us haven t.  Between us we ordered most of the appetizers and lunch dishes that the server recommended.    When the food finally came  it s clear that either the server or the kitchen staff messed up several of the orders  which took even more time to fix.  All of the food tasted okay but nothing worth noting.  Tacos and enchiladas were bland.  The Armstrong queso that people rave about just tasted like they threw some greasy ground beef into an average queso that you can often find at Austin area restaurants.  We wouldn t come back here.
Matt's El Rancho,411,This was one of the more legitimately confusing dining experience of my life. I cannot make sense of this place s popularity.  I had the famous asadero tacos which were quite passable if distinctly overpriced. The beef in these tacos was juicy and well seasoned.    However  having eaten delicious meat before  as I live in freaking Austin  Texas   the tacos did not blow my socks off. Until I compared them other items that accompanied my meal and those of my dining companion.   The teaspoon of guacamole each of us were served atop a substantial mound of wilted lettuce had the distinct sheen and mouth feel of phlegm.    My boyfriend s tamale tasted like something that had been frozen and then poorly defrosted. Notice I don t say it tasted like a defrosted frozen tamale. I ve had plenty of delicious defrosted frozen tamales   It taste like some terrible microwave meal item and distinctly unlike a tamale.  The beans tasted as though they specifically had all their natural bean flavor somehow expeller pressed from them.  This was Tex Mex that I would expect in Ohio.  Not Texas.
Matt's El Rancho,412,I tried Matt s El Ranchero for the first time after being in Austin for 3 years  I can t believe it took me so long to find out about this place. Now we go twice a month at least  I absolutely love the atmosphere and authentic  delicious Mexican food  My menu favorites would be the guacamole  Janie s salad with chicken  fajita s  chicken quesadillas and of course the house margarita  I can t wait to bring family and friends here when they visit Austin 
Matt's El Rancho,413,Enjoyed the beef fajita lunch special.  Meat portion was skimpy but food was good overall.  Great service.  Nice outdoor patio.  Visited from out of town.
Matt's El Rancho,414,Best Chicken Fajitas in Austin  Fresh Guacamole  amp  Mexican Martinis are refreshing  amp  u won t stop at one 
Matt's El Rancho,415,The food was good but when the food came out it was cold and had to send it back to the kitchen. The service was not as good as expected. But over all it was a ok experience.
Matt's El Rancho,416,To be honest  I don t get the hype for this place. I ve been a few times for dinner on a weekend night and there is always a wait. It is not bad food but there are so many good Mexican food places around town that I don t feel like waiting here over half an hour to get a table. Out of everywhere I ve ever eaten in Austin over the past 10 years there are more people over 50 here than any other place around. I think a lot of people have been coming to Matt s as a family for however long it has been around and they love it for sentimental reasons more than anything else.  I will say I went with a group for happy hour last week and it was much more enjoyable when it wasn t crowded. The food is not cheap even on happy hour though. I had 2 ritas  a large queso for the table  and a taco salad and my bill was over  50.
Matt's El Rancho,417,Step down from the famous joe t s but it s good for Austin. Long waits and slow servers. Drinks will be filled once and once only. Don t come in your in a hurry.
Matt's El Rancho,418,Matt s El Rancho is an Austin STAPLE. Great food and awesome drinks. Love taking my out of town friends here when they re visiting.
Matt's El Rancho,419,Waited 1 hour and 40 minutes for a table on Saturday night. Not worth the wait. Food was average at best. My friend asked the waiter what the difference was between burrito and enchiladas. He said it s the same just wrapped differently. Really.   I honestly don t understand the hype of this place. Don Dar os is much better and always a good crowd but no long wait.  Service seemed to be entitled like we were lucky to be there. No thanks 
Matt's El Rancho,420,They are doing excellent job with curbside and the best to go containers  thankfully not styrofoam . My go to is the deluxe plate and I sub for cheese enchiladas and charo beans   I love the fajitas and salsa is spicy and delicious. Tortilla soup is also tasty  I m a fan   
Matt's El Rancho,421,Matt s El Rancho on South Lamar has turned into one of The Best Restaurants after Re-opening from The Covid Quarantine.  The Staff is on top of all The Covid 19 policies and it is very clean and sanitized.  The food and drinks are delicious.  We really like the great Customer Service from waiter Adrian.  The Margaritas are so good. Thanks Matt s El Rancho for a wonderful evening out 
Matt's El Rancho,422,I love the place. One of the best places to get good fresh Mexican food. I plan to give it another chance when I get back on that side of town but  when they first reopened  I had to wade through young people that didn t wear masks swarming the front door and not social distancing to get in. I reviewed them negatively for not controlling it better then but it sounds like they may have fixed it. Hopefully  the ones without masks are still healthy.
Matt's El Rancho,423,I swear I just called them on the phone and asked if they do to-go margs  she said yes. I said we will be there in a minute. We get there and she goes  we only take to go s over the phone.  So I stand there on the patio in front of the hostess stand and call the restaurant  the hostess goes back inside to answer my phone call. Lol. After I place my order she tells me they only take payment for to-go s over the phone. No cash. I m like  ok I guess we can t order then cause I have cash..   and she goes  okay So cancel the order    Yeah I guess   okay bye  and hangs up. Like waste more of my time and be a little more rude 
Matt's El Rancho,424,As the saying goes  its Always Good.  It has been a few years since my last visit.  However  it is not because anything other than just not being on this side of town.  I had the perfect trifecta today  Bob Armstrong dip  El Rancho salad with the cheese enchilada  and Rainbow sherbet.    All of the food here is consistently good.  Weekdays they have great lunch specials from 11 to 2.  If you have not given them a try you should and if you have you know what I am talking about.
Matt's El Rancho,425,We went this past weekend and the food was great  Our server was really funny also  I forgot his name but he was a red head with a beard. Any who my favorite was the chips and salsa    They salsa had a kick to it and it was phenomenal  This chips are to die far  I would go back just for the chips and salsa. I ordered the quesadillas and they were a hit as well  Will def go back soon once in the Austin area   
Matt's El Rancho,426,All time favorite spot in Austin. Lively vibe  killer margaritas  crave worthy bob armstrong dip  and best fajitas I ve ever had. You can come here as you are  dressed up  in sweats  with your parents  drunk after boating all day  etc. I ve done it all 
Matt's El Rancho,427,My bf and I decided to stop  amp  eat bc we hadn t been in so long. We re both from Austin. He wanted to take me  amp  I live their Bob Armstrong dip. He ate a fajita chicken burrito and I had the Chicken Chili Relleno. This was around 6 pm January 13  2019. He ate all his food  but I saved my being full on queso. He got sick through the night  amp  missed work Monday  he told me he thought the chicken wasn t cooked properly  but I said he just had a stomach bug. Nope. I ate my leftover entree the next day heating it in my oven  amp  I was sick all night and morning. I love Matt s  But it ll be another 3-5 years before Anyone can convince me to go back. I ll be sticking to the queso from now.       Hi Paul   You re right. I thought it was a virus  but I was so ill  I went to see my PCP  amp  he said it was food poisoning  it can occur within hours. So perhaps 2 people suffering from the same issue eating the same type of meat is highly likely. I appreciate you reaching out  amp  letting me know  but I ve had both in my lifetime  amp  know the difference.   Food poisoning symptoms  which can start within hours of eating contaminated food  often include nausea  vomiting or diarrhea. Most often  food poisoning is mild and resolves without treatment. But some people need to go to the hospital.   Thanks for taking the time to respond  amp  I do appreciate you stopping by our table to make sure we were doing well.  Take care.
Matt's El Rancho,428,Came for lunch and was not disappointed. Great chips  amp  salsa and service was good. Ordered the chicken enchiladas which were amazing. Will definitely be coming back.
Matt's El Rancho,429,Amazing food  We ordered  two dots and the Bob . The Bob was amazing and our steak tacos were unbelievable. Best steak tacos we ve ever had.
Matt's El Rancho,430,Visiting Austin is an adventure in food to say the least.  Having enjoyed truly fine dining at Otoko and Le Politique  our next adventure was to find the best Tex-Mex available.  Doing online research let us to Matt s El Rancho  which unfortunately was a huge disappointment.  While there was a healthy wait for our larger than average party  it was nothing outrageous  and most people seemed to be leaving in a fairly respectable time  so even with our young grandchildren  and the promise of outstanding Tex-Mex  we decided to wait.  The atmosphere is more dining hall than anything else  and it was one of the loudest restaurants I ve visited...ever   There is really nothing special about the menu offerings - pretty predictable - and absolutely nothing that separates El Rancho from the plethora of other Tex-Mex offerings in the region...in fact  I believe there are likely many others offering far superior food than El Rancho.  We were all universally disappointed with all of our orders.  Again  there was nothing special  and most of the offerings were pretty strongly seasoned without adding to the overall flavor.    Next time  if I want authentic Tex-Mex in Austin  Texas  Chili s is as apt to gain my business.  Matt s El Rancho   sorry  you had your chance  and you ve been found wanting.
Matt's El Rancho,431,One of the large tourist attractions in Austin.  It really is quite a rambling restaurant.  The Bob Armstrong dip lived up to its reputation  as did the giant chips and guacamole.  Service was good even for a large party.  The steak fajitas were fresh and delicious.  Our driver had commented that this place would be too  touristy  and not as authentic as other smaller Tex Mex restaurants but that turned out not to be the case.  The food and drinks were delicious and we shall return.
Matt's El Rancho,432,Very busy location but the space is huge and they are very quick with orders. I wanted to get some Mexican before I left Texas and after reading reviews  decided to give this place a try. So glad I did  The menu contain a variety of foods. I ordered the beef and chicken combo fajitas  my coworker had some kind of fish entree  and we ordered chicken quesadillas to go. Everything was good. You get chips and salsa while you wait. The Salsa was very fresh. Must try if you re looking for authentic Mexican food in Austin.
Matt's El Rancho,433,Love this place  I live in Dallas and attempt to eat here every chance I get when I m in Austin. The food is really good and the drinks are even better. The atmosphere is nice and upbeat at times. They have a Mariachi band that plays on weekends during the evening  however that can be a little annoying at times  nonetheless I m sure tourist loved it  I ve always enjoyed my time here. The queso dip is fantastic and did I mention their drinks. Oh yes  the food. I had the beef and cheese enchilada combo the last time I was here and it was really flavorful. The quality of the food here is very good compared to other places. I like eating here because I have such a good time here  staff have always been attentive and friendly based on my experience.  I highly recommend trying this place out if you ve never been here.
Matt's El Rancho,434,One of our favorite local Mexican spots. They re soo good  They usually have a wait - but all of the good places here do. Never too long.
Matt's El Rancho,435,I ordered the Asadero Tacos  the meat was cooked pretty well and the tortillas were nice. On the other hand I felt as if the grilled cheese that is in the tacos were a little too rubbery for my taste. Would come back and visit again but would try something else.
Matt's El Rancho,436,Me and my Family had a Birthday dinner on September 3  2020 with a group of 15 and we were treated very unfriendly and unprofessional. We all know we are in a Pandemic so we didn t need to feel any less uncomfortable and the female server that attended us was rude along with the male host. I have no intentions along with my Family to ever dine at this Restaurant again....native Austininte  
Matt's El Rancho,437,Service was a little slow but the food made up for it. We started with the Armstrong cheese dip. It was good. We shared brisket tacos that were greasy and grilled. The beans are flavorful. This place is huge. They have indoor and outdoor seating. There is a large parking lot.
Matt's El Rancho,438,We went to Matt s El Rancho last weekend for dinner. It was super crowded  but we were seated within 30 minutes. I love the Bob Armstrong dip and the margs are good  Definitely some good Tex Mex 
Matt's El Rancho,439,I finally made it to Matt s Famous El Rancho  For the record I ve driven there 3 other occasions but it s always been a Tuesday  the day they re closed. NO MATTER  I finally made it there on Not A Tuesday and it was a freaking mad house. I think at one point there were 15 blonde high school girls that walked past me in dresses. Prom  Maybe  No it was December. Whatever I m getting distracted.   If you want to observe a bunch of Westlake families this is the place to do it. I think I counted about 8 people I recognized from high school here. Weird. ANYWAY  the food was really great. It s tex-mex which means a lot of cheese and gooey delicious goodness  but they made it taste really great.   We tried the  vegetarian  bob armstrong dip- which is nothing special. But I ve heard the original is amaaaaazing.   The shrimp chile relleno and shrimp enchiladas were delicious. They had fantastic flavor  and massive portions. I mean  it was really really good  but those kinds of dishes ARE really really good. So yes. Not a bad time. Not sure if I d go again just for fear of seeing more people I know from high school  yes I m that person   but the place is amazing and always hoppin.
Matt's El Rancho,440,Matt s changed my life.  1. The Food  Service and Ambiance are consistently out of this world  2. Get the Deluxe Dinner with a side of fried garlic and jalapenos.  Thank you  JK for this secret recommendation.  3. Get Bob Armstrong cheese dip. Wow.
Matt's El Rancho,441,Not the same El Rancho I grew up with   Way commercialized   Food is still ok  Margaritas still ok.   Bartenders not attentive at all  It was a great place when the family ran it  Oh well 
Matt's El Rancho,442,Very good  some of the best Mexican food I ve had  and I m a native Texan. Thanks to covid  we were actually seated right away and the service was great.
Matt's El Rancho,443,For all Austinites who been coming for many years since the early 50 s to Matt s El  Rancho  you been more than dedicated and loyal yes food is delicious but waiting for a table for 1 to hours get real. Your life will pass you by. Very busy and down right crazy crowded pushing shoving and people were agitated just waiting for a table we were told our wait time was well over an hour yes  we were hungry and tired after a long day. So I rate the food five stars but overall loud not relaxing environment 3 stars. I love the well made flour  tortillas  but the Deluxe plate was very good and made home style but what turned me off was the l loud sport tv bar some chairs were just in the middle of the bar area where people were tripping just to head to the bar area to wait for a table. Parking is a joke ridiculous no parking anywhere. Will I return I will  think about it since there are about 5 mexican resturants that are top and similar to Matt s but wait times are lot less. It is sort of touristy type of resturant. So will  I want to return yes just for the bar  drinks are made very well so cudos to the bartender he got it right. One point is the food is very reasonable price wise and so fabulous but i did mention you have to try it at least one time so you can try this traditional Mexican resturant been around for years and many famous people have been spotted here. SO ENJOY
Matt's El Rancho,444,Service was lackluster  but it s graduation weekend.  Food was unimpressive. We were told that it s the best queso and tex-mex around  and the food was blah at best. Queso resembled melted velveeta with bland taco meat on top.
Matt's El Rancho,445,Food  bean and cheese nachos while they tasted good were served cold. HELL NO. Flautas were covered in too much toppings that made them soggy. I like crispy flautas. Enchilada with ranchero sauce was tasty. The ranchero sauce was very delicious. Also it was nice treat to have sherbet ice cream after dinner.   So if I eat here again I would make sure to order something with ranchero sauce but would refuse to accept cold nachos by demanding hot ones.   Atmosphere is jumping and fun. Loads of people all having a fiesta of a time 
Matt's El Rancho,446,The place is the bomb  Best Tex Mex in Austin by far. Great margaritas fish tacos 100  on point. Queso insane
Matt's El Rancho,447,I came here for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. Our servers name was Micah and she was great  Everything came out perfectly and diligently which was amazing for how busy this restaurant gets. My sister had the pecan smoked chicken enchiladas and loved them  I will definitely be coming back 
Matt's El Rancho,448,Greatest restaurant on earth. I have had everyone of my birthdays at Matt s since I have been born. Joe and Moe are great servers. The bob Armstrong queso is without a doubt the greatest queso on the planet.
Matt's El Rancho,449,Love  love  love this joint   Hit it every time I come to town and it makes me want to move to Austin. Me and Bob Armstrong have a thing going on.   Fantastic food and service. Don t miss an opportunity to eat here.
Matt's El Rancho,450,I think the popularity of this restaurant reflects its cool history rather than its food. Upon arriving I was shocked on the number of people there. We waited an hour for out table but I didn t mind because of their full bar  highly recommend the sangria margarita.   Once we got to our table  we ordered our food. I had the green chicken enchiladas and a chicken taco  The Matt s Special.  I enjoyed the enchiladas however I was not blown away like I had expected to be  because of the buzz about the restaurant. I did not like the chicken taco. There was nothing wrong with it  it was just boring.  Overall  the place is nice but the food isn t the best I ve had. If visiting Austin I think it could be a cool place to visit due to its history  however I don t see myself returning on a regular basis due to the wait time and good  but not amazing food.
Matt's El Rancho,451,Great experience  Food was incredible  waiter was awesome. We will definitely be back  Go here  You won t be disappointed.
Matt's El Rancho,452,Matt EL Rancho came and catered for my sons rehearsal dinner. The food was amazing and the staff was extremely professional and did an awesome job ensuring I didn t have lift a finger the entire evening. They are reasonably priced and I would love to have them cater another event at my home. I highly recommend them  one word of advice is book early they have a ton of business so reserving might be difficult we booked one year in advance   
Matt's El Rancho,453,We went to Matt s on June 1st  and I would have to say my plate was just average  nothing special. I had the shrimp chile rellenos. It came out kind of odd  the shrimp was just left on top of the relleno  was not stuffed inside  and the plate overall was lukewarm. Also  what s with the raisin and pecans on this plate  Am I missing something  I didn t really like that.  The queso was great  and we were seated pretty quickly  We were surprised.
Matt's El Rancho,454,Atmosphere is okay and the drinks are strong...but the food is god awful.  I have never had an acceptable meal here...from a handful of attempts.  It s not  just okay  or  not the best ...the food is actually gross.  Not sure why so many people go here...maybe the free valet  Lol. It s certainly not the food.
Matt's El Rancho,455,Troubled. In this time especially  with COVID-19  we are attempting to support our loved local businesses. Matt s - We paid  73 including tipping  company mandated plus our own  for the wonderful people working  but we only ordered some sides to compliment our own fajita meat at home. Just two of us. Yes  we paid it out of desperation for some good  ol TexMex  but this is seriously all we got. Watery beans  supposed to be refried black beans   small  very small  portions of pretty much everything  like rice  sour cream  guac  etc. Pretty bad. Not cool for  73. We love you Matt s for dining in  but not for take-out. BUT - 5 stars for logistics and handling.
Matt's El Rancho,456,As a big fan of Tex-Mex restaurants I figured I would try this one out and it was a good decision. The chips and salsa were excellent and the food was great. One thing I would like to point out is that our waitress was completely absent throughout our visit. Drinks took 20 mins to come out and the check took another 20 mins to be brought to us. Besides that undesirable service the food and drinks were amazing.
Matt's El Rancho,457,Paul C reached out to me and I did revisit Matt s. The evening was very enjoyable with good service  food  and company. Thanks  I ll see y all again soon
Matt's El Rancho,458,The restaurant was nice  the server was sweet as heck... but holy moley  The chicken fajita taco salad is where it s AT  10 10 will order again 
Matt's El Rancho,459,I have been going  here since the 60s when they were in their first location   not Lamar  . Although a lot has changed over the years and they no longer offer some of the items I remember as a kid  it s always a nostalgic trip and I enjoy going with my adult children and grandchildren.
Matt's El Rancho,460,2 words  BOB ARMSTRONG  Arguably some of the best queso in Austin  a must try.. The marggies are made from fresh limes rather than some syrupy mix and depending upon your palate  you may need a splash of OJ to sweeten it up a bit. The food tends to be more mex then tex-mex  which can be a welcoming change in a town overwhelmed by tex-mex.  Depending upon the weather  we will sit outside on the patio or in the bar area. This place is a popular spot  so get there early or expect to have a few in the bar while you wait for your table  either way  get there for The Bob 
Matt's El Rancho,461,I went at about 6 30 pm on a Saturday  and there were lots of big groups. My friend and I got in okay without a wait since there was only two of us. I think a UT game had just ended  so that may have been part of it  lots of UT colors . Service was pretty good  except our guac went to the wrong table  so wait for that was a bit long. We had to wait for another guac. Then  my friend s dinner went to the wrong table  so more waiting for that one. I got steak fajitas  and she got one of the enchiladas. Food was great. So much food for the fajitas  though. They come in 1 2 lb. or 1 lb. I also had a margarita. I forget the name of it and can t find their drink menu anywhere online. It was tasty and strong. There is a big menu  pretty inside the place  and huge   and fun atmosphere. I d come back  though maybe split the fajitas with someone next time.
Matt's El Rancho,462,The Mexican Martini is amazing  You have to get one of you go. I also had the beef tacos  el carbon and if was delicious. Queso is very good as well. All around I didn t have anything that I didn t like  Would definitely recommend.
Matt's El Rancho,463,Came for happy hour with friends today. Our waiter was attentive and in good spirits  Queso  on point. Knockouts  on point as always.
Matt's El Rancho,464,Lame service tonight. Been dining here for 40 years. We always order chicken chile  relleno with green sauce  cut the sour cream  with a small Bob.   Server took our drink order. I dipped a chip into their superb salsa. Stale  tough chips. The salsa is pretty spicy here  and I needed some water. Couldn t eat more than 2 of the stale chips  but I needed water.   We waited over 5 minutes for our water and beer. I was really mad about not getting to eat their tasty salsa due to the inedible chips and it pushed me over the edge that our server vanished and never returned.   We split and hit Home Slice Pizza. Got our drinks within 2 minutes.   Disappointed with the food and service.
Matt's El Rancho,465,Was recommend to me and I read good review also. Its a huge place. Loud and fun. I can see it being a good option for a birthday or bachelorette party. The food was uninspired. Tacos El carbon were just meat wrapped in a tortilla like a burrito. There wasn t much to it. We also got a text Mex platter - dinner number one. It was not delicious.   I would not go back or recommend the food. But it does have a fun atmosphere.
Matt's El Rancho,466,Honestly beautiful location inside and out  service was great. I haven t been out to eat where so many people didn t enjoy their food. There was a taco dish that they ve won awards for that was the least worst thing we ordered. Other than this we tried fajitas  enchiladas and a chicken burrito...none of which were good. I honestly don t think I ve ever been to a restaurant and been so disappointed with so many dishes. Unsure what the hype is here. Everything was under seasoned and over cooked. Not worth a visit unfortunately.
Matt's El Rancho,467,This place came highly recommended and is obviously extremely popular - when we arrived  there was about a 20 minute wait and I got the impression that was a little light.  Drinks were mediocre and the food was decent  but nothing special. We re a party of six and tried something different all around  nobody was dissatisfied but no one was raving about their food either. We were all from out of state and nothing we had couldn t have been found better at home. Bummer.  That said  friendly service and the chips and salsa were pretty decent.
Matt's El Rancho,468,Loved it. So great. I went based on a recommendation from a guy in a local rock band named after some piece of cutlery. It s classic Tex-Mex in the style I remember growing up around the Fort Worth area. Super good chicken enchiladas and guac and chips. Making it a tradition to visit whenever I m in town.
Matt's El Rancho,469,Very rarely do I give out a perfect score  as it leaves no need for improvement to the awarded. Well  last night  I discovered the smoothest  streamline service in the most fully-packed house I have ever experienced. How those staffers do it  is beyond me. I could not imagine trying to walk around this many people  carrying a tray full of margarita glasses and heavy food. WOW  The hostess  Corina  remembered my name  even though there were hundreds of people there. Texts are sent to you when your table is ready. Our waiter  Ruben  didn t miss a thing of our order. He was very friendly and fast. I m telling you  it was like a regular lunch day in that place with the speed of service  even though the restaurant was stuffed to every corner with people. Now I see why they do not take reservations. Friday and Saturday nights are the busiest. Now  let s talk about food and drink. Margaritas were delicious. We tried a few different ones  the Cactus one  frozen   Mexican martini and a regular margarita. The best  No need to add to the 30 000 000 positive reviews of the Bob Armstrong queso and chips. You already know what I am going to say. It was actually searching online for a queso recipe at home that lead me to this restaurant in the first place. Entrees  I ordered the beef fajitas. Generous with the meat  but my only beef  get it   is a little skimpy on the toppings-- sour cream  guac and tomatoes. Plenty of lettuce. Dish was delicious though. I ve never paid  20 for fajitas  but I took plenty home to enjoy later. My husband ordered the Shrimp Chile Relleno. My daughter  14  ordered the Chicken Fried Steak  but only ate one or two bites because she was too full from devouring the homemade chips and queso. I saw that coming. She did eat her salad though. The ranch is fantastic  I promised to attempt to make it at home. No desserts were ordered.  Don t let the number of people and wait time deter you from staying. Grab a drink at the bar while you wait. Once you sit at your table  you have plenty of room to enjoy. The drinks come fast and cold. The food is speedy and very good. The staff is obviously trained in customer service excellence. If you don t want to go when it is super busy  go on a Monday.   THANK YOU  Matt s 
Matt's El Rancho,470,Heard good stuff about this place but it was average. Good salsa and good lunch menu. The food was decent but not worth the hype
Matt's El Rancho,471,We came on a Saturday night around 6 00pm with a crowd of about 10 ppl. The place was crowded and seemed like a happening place so we stopped by for dinner. Overall the food was average  we had queso  fajitas and quesadillas  and the service was very slow and limited. I wouldn t recommend this place.   Pros  Big restaurant so can easily accommodate a party of 10  Bar area is a good size to eat drinks while you wait for a table   Cons  Food and drinks are ok for the price range  Service is poor - I suspect due to bad staff to customer ratios
Matt's El Rancho,472,Even tho I went to UT I never went here while I lived in Austin. So upon a return visit to the 512 I finally went to Matt s  and I have to say  it was damn good. I especially loved the famous Bob dip. The only thing I did not like is the salsa for the chips. In fact all the salsas are way too spicy. Get the chile relleno.
Matt's El Rancho,473,This place is simply awesome. I m usually a pretty big snob when it comes to queso  but this place - just wow. Big points for the Knockout drinks too. My fajitas were also very good. Great place for really any occasion. I will gladly be back.
Matt's El Rancho,474,First off  let me apologize for my initial review and for jumping to conclusions. The staff at Matt s El Rancho did not deserve that.  I made a quick conclusion that my sun glasses had been stolen  when in fact they had been properly stored in lost and found by the staff.  The general manager  Paul  was kind enough to follow up with me personally a few days later  and be sure I received my sunglasses back.  I guess karma is real  because here I am  eating my own words  and down an extra  200 bucks for buying a new pair of sunglasses I didn t need   Needless to say  the staff has always been great  and they treat both their staff and customers with the upmost respect.  I owe you Matt s El Rancho and I hope I am welcome back  mainly because I m addicted to your queso ....
Matt's El Rancho,475,The longstanding Tex-Mex icon that is an obligatory stop for any Austin visit.  A perfect setting for friends and a nice complement to the other culinary spots in town.  Truthfully the fajita and cheese dip are just above average but the reputation and atmosphere will keep you coming back.
Matt's El Rancho,476,Very popular so it gets crowded  but it also has a lot of seating so we got a table right away.  Also has very large parking lot.  I always hate driving around looking for a spot or hoping someone leaves so you can park.   Salsa was pretty hot  everyone at our table was happy to see our drinks arrive.  Corn for chips  etc..  is non- GMO   I like this   Inside is very clean and nice. Good ambiance. The Bob Armstrong dip was very good.  You should try it .  Queso with taco meat  and guacamole all in one. Ordered the Deluxe Dinner for lunch.  The Deluxe dinner came out but only half of it.  A salad portion    Rest came out and confirmed it does out as two plates. Plates were colorful  food was fresh flavorful and very good.   I would recommend.   Our dinner Aldo came with fee iced tea and a sherbet dessert.
Matt's El Rancho,477,It blows my mind that someone gave this place anything under 5 stars  Our waiter Corey was such a nice guy and gave excellent service along with the entire staff who is incredibly attentive to every table. Everything we ordered was so tasty  from the margaritas  to the tacos al pastor  and the chicken was some of the best fajita chicken I ve had   I highly recommend this place  I m looking forward to coming back.
Matt's El Rancho,478,Very good queso  Even the vegetarian option is super good. Only took off one star because the bean and cheese nachos come covered in habanero peppers and others.... this Californian thought they were bell peppers  was not prepared for the burn 
Matt's El Rancho,479,I love me some tex-mex.  Huge portions  enough for left overs   great service  and good drinks.  The bar did take a bit to get drinks out but all in all not a bad experience.
Matt's El Rancho,480,Went to Matt s el rancho on a Sunday night and it was very crowded  We were sat outside with no wait and the outdoor patio has a great atmosphere. Ordered the chicken and cheese enchiladas with verde sauce which were good. Also got the famous queso dip which was good as well  Overall a positive experience and the service was really good too.
Matt's El Rancho,481,Can t do more than 2 stars for this place and only doing that because ... well don t really know       What I do know is that all the people that go here have no clue what real Mexican food is and that s why it s popular.   It s Tex Mex food which is bland   tasteless dishes and what people that go here like.   Service is awful       Servers are rude and rushed   You wait a long time for bad  and COLD food.   Oh I remember now    Why I gave them 2 stars... it was for the Decor... yeah that s what the 2stars are for.   The Decor is nice    Can t recommend eating here  I d be lying. But if you love texmex food than go for it.
Matt's El Rancho,482,I was so excited to eat here  We had just arrived in Texas from the Mexican food desert of Maui  and we couldn t wait for some real Tex Mex    We were seated right away even though we had a party of 10. Our waiter showed up quickly and brought us all our waters and took our drink orders. We were also given tons of chips and salsa which was a great thing for me. I love chips and salsa  and I love it even more when it comes included in your meal. The salsa was quite spicy and very flavorful. All the adults loved it  but it was way too hot for the kids. We ordered a cheese dip for them so they could have something to dip their chips in too.   I ordered a lime margarita and it was very flavorful and tasty. I also had a prickly pear margarita later in the meal and I highly recommend that one    Our meals came about 15 minutes later  and that s where the three stars comes in. I ordered two cheese enchiladas with black beans as I am vegetarian. The first two bites of my enchiladas had chicken in them. When I mentioned this to the waiter he just looked at them and then said looks like cheese to me and just stood there like I was inconveniencing him. So  I chose to just deal with it. The cheese also just tasted like Kraft cheese melted in a tortilla and there wasn t much sauce or flavor to the sauce. I ended up only eating half of my meal and then filling up on chips and salsa. I was pretty disappointed over all on the other food choice my table mates had as well. I would probably only come back for the drinks and chips and salsa. Although there was a great kids menu available for those with young ones.
Matt's El Rancho,483,Matt s is an Austin staple  and has withstood the test of time because it is great food  mixed with great service. The enchiladas are awesome  but the best thing on the menu are the Asadero tacos  Those things will change your life 
Matt's El Rancho,484,A Austin tradition.  Went for lunch  margaritas and queso. Brisket tacos were amazing. And since we had just arrived  they nicely stored our luggage for us in the office.
Matt's El Rancho,485,Excellent tortilla soup and beef fajita combination salad. Nice covered patio and great service as usual. Favorite place to eat in Austin 
Matt's El Rancho,486,The first thing I liked about Matt s was no wait on a Saturday at lunchtime. The server took a while to bring our drinks  but the chips and salsa came out immediately.   The chips seem a lot crunchier than other places and are cut in halves instead of quarters so they are bigger too. But let s talk about the margaritas for a second. We both ordered the Cactus Pryor margarita which is their take on the prickly pear. They are on the smaller side and  7 a pop so my heart sank a little when he brought them out. That is until I took a sip and almost tipped my chair backwards from the punch of tequila. They are not messing around here    I didn t even finish my drink which says a lot  Nicely done.   My meal came with a  guacamole salad  which was nothing more than a side plate of shredded lettuce and tomatoes with a small scoop of guacamole. They put a spicy liquid over the top of the guacamole which was okay  but I prefer it plain.   I had the cheese enchiladas in a green sauce which I enjoyed. The only thing I didn t care for was the scoop of regular queso over the top of them as well. They had melted white cheese already so the queso was overkill to me. Sometimes less is more.   All the flavors were good though and while they aren t the best Tex-Mex I ve had in Austin  I would come back again. Read more as 3.5 stars. Would be 4 if the prices were a bit lower.
Matt's El Rancho,487,Iconic Austin institution serving yummy Tex Mex. Started with the Bob dip which is a must  cheese dip with meat  guac and  green chilis. Everyone enjoyed there entrees. The service was excellent and the venue was so beautiful.
Matt's El Rancho,488,  DIDN T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO EAT HERE  MANAGER HOST STAND ONLY    Was very disappointed  showed up yesterday evening with family and small k9 and the manager said no dogs-even on the patio....worst part is  I had called ahead and asked specifically if k9 s were allowed  and whomever answered the phone  informed me that dogs were allowed on the patio.....sorely disappointed.
Matt's El Rancho,489,Crowded  loud  popular and on a Weds. night  Good Tex-Mex. The Queso was delicious as were the margaritas  Our table had 2 kinds. Chips were fresh but didn t care for their salsa. Thick and too hot. Our table had a Taco salad  Enchilada plate with Taco and Fajita Chile Rellano. All were good but not outstanding. Rice was dry  beans were good. Fresh tortillas  nice. Excellent service.
Matt's El Rancho,490,Yep. The green enchiladas were the bomb dot com. Pretty much what you would expect- a very large family friendly Mexican restaurant. Everything we got was really good and left beyond full. Recommendations  queso  strawb marg  steak tacos.
Matt's El Rancho,491,Soooooooo great. I have been eating here for years. Matt s fries  add meat  bob Armstrong  fajitas  cowboy style chicken fried steak  not on menu  you ll thank me later       Best Mexican martini that I have found in town  
Matt's El Rancho,492,Had an amazing experience here. The parking lot is huge and appeared pretty packed so we thought for sure there would be a long wait. Little did we know how big it is inside. We went on a Sunday and had a 10 minute wait. The chips and salsa were delicious  but HOT . We did the chicken fajitas for two. Sooo tasty with a flavor unlike most standard fajitas you have around at other Mexican restaurants.   The owner even stopped by to talk with us  She was the sweetest thing and we kept talking to her for about 5 minutes  Apparently  it s not uncommon to have a 1-2 hour wait and they don t take reservations  This place has been around for a long time.   Our only complaint was our waitress would disappear for periods of time. Even when we gave her our credit card she was gone for probably 15 minutes and the restaurant had died down quite a bit with customers.
Matt's El Rancho,493,As soon as I saw the mob out the door  that it s  6 valet-only parking as far as I could tell and the lot was packed  I turned around and left. Nah. Maybe it s really good but there s other options.
Matt's El Rancho,494,I get that you are the most popular non-franchised  Mexican restaurant as well as one of the top money makers  however it s ridiculous to seat a party of ten out back on your dark  non-enclosed patio with temps in the 40 s and howling wind  Several of our guests were from out of state  and I for one was embarrassed--we were freezing by the time the food arrived  and we couldn t even see what we were eating. FAIL  I won t be back  and I ll take my guests to Guero s next time.
Matt's El Rancho,495,Poor customer service  mediocre food. I had high expectations for this restaurant due to the reviews  but was quite disappointed. Wait time was reasonable  service took awhile  food took awhile. Food came out cold  we had to go find a manager to fix it  our waitress gave a general  sorry  and walked off. We asked for tortialls  more salsa  and never received anything. Many other  better tex mex restaurants in Austin. Also  they wont split checks.
Matt's El Rancho,496,Let s TACO- bout how this place was named Texas Monthly as one of the 120 tacos you must try before you die. If Matt says so 
Matt's El Rancho,497,Love sitting out on their patio. Chips and salsa good. Margaritas good. Enchiladas Verdes good. Love their brisket soft tacos  but found them inconsistent with the meat portions when getting them to go. Also really enjoyed the Ranchero beans  until they started becoming way too watery and not enough beans. They are way too stingy with their delicious rice which is very annoying when we ordered an extra side on several occasions and were barely given 1 3 cup. Rice and beans are inexpensive and the portions should be bigger. Last time we ate there  husband tried the Chile relleno and enchiladas. He was so disappointed with the processed cheese they used we haven t been back. Being new to Texas we were not aware that is common here  We like Real Natural cheese 
Matt's El Rancho,498,We were nearing the end of our trip to Austin when we realized we still hadn t had queso  real Texas queso  We quickly ordered a car service and before we could say margarita we were at Matt s Famous El Rancho. It was a hot Sunday afternoon  the restaurant was busy and there was a wait for a table. So we snagged seats at the bar  ordered a couple of margaritas and the famous Bob Armstrong Dip aka queso which happens to be gluten free. The Dip was a deliciously addictive concoction of cheese sauce topped with seasoned ground beef AND guacamole. The salted chips provided the pefect texture and way to get it from bowl to mouth but to be honest it would have been good eaten with a spoon too    The Dip was so good that after we finished our first order we got a second including more margaritas   Then in true gluttony  we took an order to go and Ubered back to who knows where happily buzzed having checked Bob Armstrong Dip off of our food bucket list 
Matt's El Rancho,499,We enjoy the food  drink and atmosphere of Matt s.  If they say your wait is 45 minutes it usually takes 15 minutes even for patio seating.  Go to the outside bar and order a Knock out Margarita and maybe a small  Bob  queso while you wait.  Our favorite meal is the blackened red fish.  Staff is great.  We ve seen a few celebrities there over the years too
Matt's El Rancho,500,5 star service  5 star queso dip  5 star HUGE Steak and Redfish tacos  5 star chips      So good
