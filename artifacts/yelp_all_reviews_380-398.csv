El Taquito Aviles,1,So love this place.   We just moved into a neighborhood close by and frankly we ve been a bit nervous about our lack of spanish speaking skills. The hubs is Icelandic and my brain is filled with trying to speak  Scandinavian  fluently so spanish got the bum end of my attention.  Got to the trailer and it took someone a while to take my order. I got so nervous that I nearly turned around back to my car because I didn t really know much of what was on the menu save 3 basic taco dishes.   Just before I lost my nerve the friendliest man addressed me- first speaking spanish then realizing I didn t- spoke perfect english but continued to try and encourage teach me. He kept calling me mama and making me feel so welcome.   I ordered the Fajita and the Barbacoa taco. They are tiny. But 2 tacos at  3.50 is a deal in my book so next time I ll order 4 and call it a meal for the hubs and I.   The red salsa is awesome. Spicy and unique- slightly more light hot sauce but without the vinegar punch.   These gringos will be back 
El Taquito Aviles,2,I don t like to try to many places but this place is a must    Great food  Great attention from the gentleman working at the window    Definitely gonna be added to my list of go to places    The drinks and food are freshly made when ordered     
El Taquito Aviles,3,I ve eaten here a few times. The tacos are good. The tacos aren t big so get a few with some green sauce on the side. I also got the tortas once but I wasn t a big fan. Gorditas are ok. I would suggest bring cash. I ve never tried paying with card.   Pina agua naturales pineapple juice  is good too. Not out of this world good just good.  I usually show up here on a weeknight around 10 30pm. The owner s English wasn t like amazing but she knew enough to take my order.
El Taquito Aviles,4,I ve been by here 3-4 times  and the guy knows me by sight. Plus  he s coming to hear my band practice this weekend  and bringing beer.  LOVE it   So  this is a little taco cart  basically  at the Citgo station on the corner of Ohlen and Peyton Gin. Nice guy owns it  and the food is DAMN good   First time  breakfast tacos. Nopalitos and eggs. Potatoes and eggs.   Second time  Chicken Fajita Tacos with grilled onions.   Third time  I took some friends  we tried the Barbacoa  my friend ate like 5 tacos    and the Chivo  Lamb or Goat  I can t remember but it f-ing rocked  .  They offer red and green salsas. Red is hotter  but both are tasty.  Word to the wise  they ll likely speak to you in Spanish first. Once my Spanish ran out  they started speaking to me in more English. Hopefully  my spanish will get better  but this is  in my opinion  the way it should be at a place like this.  It s not enough to move me away from the pseudo veggie side of things  but I ll definitely be back.   Tonight  he asked me what was going on with the lack of business  so I figured I d check Yelp. No profile  so here you go Austin  Good taco   Oh  and on the other side of the parking lot is a place that makes FRESH Aguas Frescas. From scratch. The taco place makes them too  but I can t yet speak to their quality.
El Taquito Aviles,5,Best taco trailer service in Austin. Hands down.   I came over here during my break from work today and I m so happy that I did  The owner couldn t be nicer. I ordered 2 barbacoa tacos and he gave me one for free  They were delicious. He also made me some fresh pineapple juice which was amazing.   I couldn t eat all the tacos and when I asked for a bag he took them back and wrapped them up for me.   Excellent service and damn good tacos. What more could you want 
El Taquito Aviles,6,this review is a yr late. i came across this taco stand due to my sensitivity to smell   i was pregnant . my partner and i went to target right across the taco stand. let me tell you ever since that day i been hitting it up. they have remodeled and upgraded the trailer since then. they have great tortas  the bread is evenly toasted. on cold days they make champurrado  and its delicious. i had their menudo. my boyfriend loves their barbacoa tacos  and so does several of my friends that i have introduced to this place. the aguas frescas are ok  i would prefer Horchata since its a staple drink with tacos  but they do carry the goo ol  mexican coke and it make the taco experience better. the trailer may not be located in the greatest area  but the tacos are slammin.
Taco Bell,1,Stop by to get my lunch. The place was quiet  serving food so fast. Tasted is regular  it not real mexican food
Taco Bell,2,Something is going on with Taco Bell - the service is soooo slow and the quality is bad. Be prepared to wait 20 minimum for your food even if there s only 2 cars in front of you in the drive thru.
Taco Bell,3,It s freaking 1 pm and they have the lobby closed          This place is such a constant disappointment  
Taco Bell,4,Slow AF drive-thru  frequently randomly closes  order accuracy always a gamble. No longer willing to sit at the drive thru myself but Uber Eats driver always gets a fat tip for dealing with location s bs if I m content to wait at home and eat a warm-ish taco.
Taco Bell,5,Idk what the fuck is going on at this Taco Bell. I will order it on door dash  it will say they accepted the order  the driver will go and wait there  suddenly an hour or even longer after I placed my order they will cancel it. Maybe they re understaffed  but if not then seriously fuck all of u that work here. This has happened a few times. I just wanted a crunch wrap supreme man. I ve worked in the food industry so I know how it is  but y all are actually ass at your jobs. I m thinking of applying and working there for a week just to see wtf goes on at the daily cuz I m actually curious how they r so bad at their job. So don t order from here.
Taco Bell,6,This is the SLOWEST drive thru or pick up that I have ever been too. Over 30 mins and the person taking my order didn t know up to sub out food.
Taco Bell,7,don t accept uber eats orders if you make drivers wait over 40 minutes to get the food  
Taco Bell,8,Staff is friendly  but the service is the slowest I ve ever experienced. Have visited this location 3 times now in the past few months and  without fail  I have waited 30  minutes for my food each time. Most recent visit there was a single car ahead of me that waited 10 minutes for a 12 pack of tacos. It s ridiculous.
Taco Bell,9,I literally can t put Into words how terrible the lady who takes your order is. She is probably the worst person I have ever met in the service industry. I ve gone to this location multiple times and every time I speak with the RUDEST women. I get that you are 37 and working at Taco Bell sucks  but you literally knew exactly what job you have signed up for. Absolutely ridiculous how heinous this woman is. She literally makes me dread going to Taco Bell. She is cruel  FIRE HER 
Taco Bell,10,THIS PLACE IS THE WORST      I have gone through the drive through on multiple occasions and never once has it taken less than 45 minutes. On what planet does it take 45 minutes to put together tacos  And you re LUCKY if they even get your order right. I d rather eat dirt than go to this place
Taco Bell,11,I m a bad Mexican for eating here  I know.  But hear me out  I was drunk  needed greasy food  and going to high school in Cali conditioned me to want this in such moments.
Taco Bell,12,I uber eats Taco Bell and they gave me a quesadilla with nothing in it. A plain tortilla. Also the lady told me to cancel my order whenever I called her. I guess they were to lazy to make my quesadilla. Also my cinnamon twist had NO cinnamon on it at all
Taco Bell,13,Literally don t ever come here- they won t even take your order through the intercom. Food always wrong.
Taco Bell,14,Fuck you Taco Bell. All I gotta say is Fuck You. You fucking suck I hate you. We waited in line for 40 fucking mother fucking minutes and as we pull up to the speaker it turns 1AM AND YOU TURNED US AWAY. I cannot explain the anger I feel at this moment. Shitty customer service. I hope the lady at the speaker never gets hired anywhere else because I would feel so bad for their coworkers working with the spawn of fucking Satan. Bitch wtf I hate y all. I cannot stand this establishment
Taco Bell,15,I was so glad to see a Taco Bell in this part of town. I was on my way to Ironman 70.3 Austin race at Travis County Exposition Center last November. It was cold and I was hungry - not a good combination when I travel.  The restaurant has a large parking lot. I didn t have problem finding a space  well  who eats here at 9 on a Saturday morning anyway.  Odd thing was the doors were locked. I kept looking at my watch and the open sign. It obviously was open because there were people in there.   So  I walked to the other entrance and inquired about their locked doors. The cashier brushed me off casually   oh yeah. We know.  Okay. Luck you  I don t live in Austin. I d reported it to the corporate.  My breakfast experience was fairly pleasant. Coffee was steamy hot and delicious. I hope the doors are all accessible on my next visit.
Taco Bell,16,Went there tonight  they forgot to give me my 2 chalupas and two nacho cheese supreme tacos  called the store and told me to get in line again. Keep in mind their drive thru line was SUPER long. I waited in line got to the window and they gave me my food. I didn t bother checking it because I would assume it would be right this time. I get home and my nacho cheese supreme tacos were missing the sour cream and tomatoes. And our food was COLD. This is the second time they have messed up my order.
Taco Bell,17,Not too great. I mean it is a taco bell  but they always getting my orders wrong  or the sauce wrong. I just get tired of it after a while. The place looks dirty if you go inside  like no one s cleaned it for a while.  The lines seem like they re always slow  no one is working particularly hard or really trying. I might be asking for too much from a fast food place  but this one on airport stuck out to me because it s just really  really bad. Drive down the block and go to a different taco bell.
Taco Bell,18,Zero stars. Don t support this business because they do not support their employees or customers. ZERO STARS IS WHAT I RATE IT 
Taco Bell,19,I really like this place because the hot sauce packets are out by the drink machine so you can just grab as many as you like. Other fast food places make you ask the person at the counter for packets and they do not give the sauce up easily. It s like  when was ketchup or sweet and sour such a high priced commodity  Just give me the packets  In my view  it s one packet per bite  and I m glad Taco Bell gets that.   Endless sauce  always.
Taco Bell,20,It s Taco Bell  nothing crazy. They definitely don t give me enough meat on my  meat filled  tacos  but what really set me off was the fact that they had an AWFUL version of John Legends hit song open your eyes.. smh Uno Star
Taco Bell,21,General Manager is not a friendly person   as usual order is incomplete General manager not once looked at me had his back towards me didn t acknowledge customer service. Will not return to this location whatsoever. Management is horrible. Shift leader Sharmae should be General Manager she was the only positive person who acknowledged customer service.
Taco Bell,22,They used to have Baja Sauce for the chalupas and now just stinky sour cream what s the deal with that Taco Bell you used to be cool    Not anymore 
Taco Bell,23,Lemme start by saying I love Taco Bell. Ive come to this location before and it used to be a good Taco Bell. I came here today and got the chalupa cravings box. I always get this but this time it was NASTY. The cinnamon twists had no cinnamon on it and the sour cream tasted extremely expired.
Taco Bell,24,Taco Bell is the same everywhere. You get what you pay for. And I love paying for my  5 cravings deal. Literally cannot be beat. It s amazing. Bless you  Taco Bell.
Taco Bell,25,It s fast food. It s Taco Bell. You know the deal.   Here s what makes this place better than the rest - we pull up after a brewery outing. Y all know how it goes. I want food and I want it now. Shit was fast. I ordered a big box - whatever the special is right now. Something about ghost pepper sauce.  Can you tell I d been drinking   Something something I only paid  5 for three different food items and a drink  all packaged in a sweet ass box.   They did not put lettuce on any of my food  as requested. WHAT. Yes  you read that correctly. They follow special instructions. There was not a single  nasty little shred of iceberg lettuce in any of my food and I was so happy.   We asked for fire sauce and holy shit  they hooked. it. up. I have so much fire sauce now. SO MUCH FIRE SAUCE.  I rarely eat Taco Bell  but y all done made me a customer for life because this location knows how to make dreams come true.
Taco Bell,26,I had this massive order of like 50 different items with 10 different payments.  I was in and out within 20minutes.  They didn t get a single order wrong.  10 10 would eat again
Taco Bell,27,Typing this as I wait 30 minutes behind 3 cars...horribly understaffed not worth your time
Taco Bell,28,MY FOOD WAS CONTAMINATED AND I GOT SICK IMMEDIATELY.  EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I generally am fine with Taco Bell...  I don t even really care that their food is often made sloppily and often doesn t have the all of the ingredients mentioned in a product  eg. No cheese in a cheesy rice and bean burrito .  This is fine  it s cheap and I was very pressed for time and money.  What is NOT ok is how it made me sick afterwards. Almost immediately after finishing my food  I felt some flu-like symptoms and they have gotten worse today. In my nose  my nasal passage and throat  I feel a raw  dry  stinging  have a runny nose and it hasn t stopped no matter how much water I drink.  I ve never gotten flu-y from food before and I don t have any allergies...  This was just such a huge surprise.  I mean  I know they don t care and nothing is probably going to change but this seems kinda messed up and I figured I should warn people.
Taco Bell,29,Look I know it s fast food and they get paid terribly. But When I m in the drive through I still don t want to see workers chomping on tacos with their mouths open  especially without gloves. At least go to the back room to take breaks. Also  I ve tried going at 10am and only after ordering do they tell me they re  only serving breakfast right now.  If you re going to eliminate your entire menu just to serve eggs inside of tortillas which is gross  have some other options. Taco Bell is all the same ingredients mixed in different ways  it s not like other fast food joints which literally can t serve breakfast and lunch at the same time. Least they could do is tell us the hours when their actual menu is available rather than just being straight up bitches when you try to order it. These workers truly don t care. Either pay them more or prepare for your chain to go extinct.   Update  I made the mistake of going to this location again. I ordered 2 quesadillas with diablo sauce and was only given 2 packets. When I asked for more sauce  I was told there is only one sauce allowed per quesadilla and the window was slammed in my face. Again  stop trying to be McDonald s. Their one sauce policy would be ridiculous if it came in a half full packet. I threw this food out since it wasn t worth it only having a few drops of sauce with it.   the sauce was the last good thing about this chain. Goodbye 
Taco Bell,30,I have low standards for taco bell  but this is THE WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. 5  times I ve come to this location an hour or more before they close and they ignore me in the drive thru and then come outside 20  minutes later and say they re closed. Wow  Thanks for wasting my time. I have never been so livid and disappointed by any business in my life. They don t care about their job and it s blatantly obvious. Get it together. All of the worst fast food experiences in my life have taken place at this Taco Bell  at this location.
Taco Bell,31,This Taco Bell has to be the worse I been to  ordered the chalupa meal and was given the cravings box this is the second time when I asked for the chalupa meal was given something else instead. Earl was the cashier yesterday and today we met with the manager Francisco and he was so fixated on saying that he wasn t given anything free in which we were not asking for anything for free that he could care less that he has incompetent workers  then a worker comes to the front of the restaurant like he wants to fight. Smh
Taco Bell,32,Been to this location twice and had delicious food. We went through the drive-thru during late evening hours. Both times we went  there was longer waiting times in comparison to other stores during similar operating hours. They also made a slight error when executing one of the orders replacing the crunchy taco in the big box meal with another burrito. However the service was friendly and the food was very yummy. The chalupa was generously piled with toppings on a puffy and warm shell.
Taco Bell,33,Classic Taco Bell food. Always good and what you d expect. Burritos were kinda skimpy  that s the reason for 3 stars instead of 5
Taco Bell,34,This is 5 5 stars for a Taco Bell - it s still a Taco Bell with the same sloppy  barely-beef offerings as any other. The high rating is for the service... I stopped by during a rush around 2 or 3 and had to wait at the last window for longer than usual. I didn t care because I wasn t in a hurry  but the lady at the window was super apologetic and offered to throw in some free items.  I declined  but appreciated the sentiment.  She was telling other employees in the kitchen to hurry it up  that people in line were waiting. I really appreciated her level of customer service.
Taco Bell,35,Long wait just for them to say they re out of tortillas. Really  I asked if they had any tortillas and they said yes. I asked if they could use the tortillas they had  small ones  to make what I had ordered  quesadilla . They said no. Guess now I remember why I haven t eaten at a Taco Bell in so long.
Taco Bell,36,Man I love taco bell.  Food is so fucking good  unfortunately after I eat taco bell I feel sick for hours and fire comes out of my butt for 24 hours.  Not really worth it.
Taco Bell,37,I am writing this review for the dude at the drive-through window at 1 AM on 07 16 14. I went to Taco Bell that early morning because I was craving a Mexican Pizza. I was informed that there were no more available. This was really disappointing since I usually never go to Taco Bell  and when I do  I get the Mexican Pizza. The guy at the window  was really apologetic and offered me a free drink. Even though I don t drink soft drinks  I really appreciated his customer service. I will definitely be coming back   Btw  the new quesarito is awesome  Get it  beans and  red sauce.
Taco Bell,38,The emotions I experience after taking my first bite into a lavish quesorita parelells agape mania. The ingenious burrito-like creation transports me to another era. An era of real  affordable Mexican food that allows me to feel like I am part of an authentic experience. Thank you Taco Bell  I ll be back. Until then  I sign off wanting you to know how I feel about you. It s not goodbye. It s see you later.
Taco Bell,39,Do they ever get an order right    drive off and entire order is wrong.. my fault for not checking before i drove off  sorry for not wanting to hold up the drive through long line next time i will
Taco Bell,40,Wtf is wrong with this place  Their drive thru is always a dozen cars long and a 30 minute wait - especially late night. Hire some damn employees already 
Taco Bell,41,what can i say.  it s taco bell..    yo queirro.  if you get tacos only  it gets surprisingly expensive.
Taco Bell,42,It s cheap it s fast and it s reasonably tasty.  OK - yeah... it s not really real mexican food  but sometimes it will do in a pinch - especially late night when there s not much else open.   This is pretty much the only big chain  fast-food  I will eat. Then again  I keep it really simple and order a couple bean burritos  with green sauce - which makes all the difference in the world  and maybe a soft taco. They really can t screw that up - discounting the one time they put like an entire handful of onions on my burrito.  This location on Airport is pretty typical. I ve only been thru the drive thru. I have no idea why they have the crazy 2 window system  pay at the first and get food at the second. The same employee seems to be working both windows whenever I stop there.  Cheap  Fast or Good. Pick 2.
Taco Bell,43,The staff is always surprisingly friendly to me. For being Taco Bell its pretty good too. Of course its not 5 star good food  but I am giving the rating to the staff  especially in the drive thru. respect  
Taco Bell,44,Food here is good. I don t have much to say except that I haven t had any bad service for any of the 3 times I ve been here. Taco Bell always has a different cheesy taste to their foods  and it probably has to do with their recently revealed secret ingredients that they use. They state that they always use fresh ingredients  and I believe them. Customer service could be better I guess. Not big on the smothered burrito.
Taco Bell,45,If I could give this Taco Bell a zero star rating I would. I have been there on 4 different occasions and I have never had my order made correctly. I have never dealt with a restaurant that is so jacked up before. I will never be going back to this Taco Bell  Ever again     
Taco Bell,46,This is the worst Taco Bell I have ever been too. Between five of us ordering not one of us got the food we actually ordered. The messed up on every single one of us. Completely left out some items. One of us got a taco that was completely cold. When we went back to talk to a manager the manager could not speak English. I love Taco Bell  but this particular location sucks. Find a different location or a different restaurant. Not worth them scamming you on your order.
Taco Bell,47,Took a total of 30 minutes to receive my food. Definitely not fast food   And when I got to the window the lady offered no apology for the wait  she just stuck her had out and gave me the total of my order. I will not be going back to this place. I could have made my own bean burrito in that time.
Taco Bell,48,Rude cashier got order wrong and charge me extra gave back and left won t be coming back
Taco Bell,49,Great employees and fast service. Better than your typical fast food experience  would recommend this specific location over others.
Taco Bell,50,One word  wow. I went to his restaurant without any great expectations but I was blown away. I got the  8 which is three soft tacos  with my own little twist of no lettuce   and it was fantastic. Add a little bit of their renowned mild sauce and you ll think you died and went to heaven. Would recommend to anybody who has a palate for high end Mexican food  11 10 
Taco Bell,51,The sweetness guy just made me a coffee 3pm in the afternoon with cream and sugar. Sweetheart. Thankyou. You get all the stars.
Taco Bell,52,I got three items but more importantly  the perfect amount of Hot sauce. Not too much where I feel like I m hurting the environment and not too little where I hate my life. I got a spork in my bag to compliment my Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes. Before this  my girlfriend used to get mad at me for using my hands. Taco Bell is improving my love life. The Crunch Wrap was neatly folded which allowed maximum grip opportunity. I was able to bite and immediately fill with Hot sauce  which by the way I had more than enough of.  All the one star reviews below me are liars.
Taco Bell,53,Your standard Taco Bell  but the woman who rang us up was ridiculously friendly and nice  I was not expecting that at any fast food place. I m a sucker for the steak gorditas. Will be back again soon 
Taco Bell,54,The crispy tacos are deeeee-LISH   But I can only give 4 stars because they insist on stocking the  Baja Blast  flavor of Mt. Dew. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CODE RED PEOPLE         jeeeeeez
Taco Bell,55,Was closed at 10 30 pm when they were supposed to close at 11. Before that  they got my order wrong 3 times. Same window girl every time  hyper aggressive. I know it s Taco Bell but come on.
Taco Bell,56,Good quick service  the food is average  but I definitely love their 7 layer burritos   Their open all day night which is pretty helpful if you have driven for 20 hours straight and haven t eaten for a while.   Like me.    I would have starved to death if I had not found this place.
Tacos Michoacan,1,Rolled tacos. Delicious tacos. Eat while inhaling fumes from the highway just meters away.   No  I m not British  I m just trying to get everyone on the Metic System.  So when you order a taco here  ask for 5 grams of hot sauce.  They love it    My only note would be the chicken fajita taco.  Please  please never put cheese on a street taco.  Not Kosher.   Not literally Kosher  but figuratively Kosher.     Yum 
Tacos Michoacan,2,Came here hoping to get some good tacos and left disappointed. Ordered barbacoa and al pastor. The barbacoa meat was of lesser quailty it had more fat than I would have liked. The al pastor was good but it was ridiculously greasy. The lady was very nice. I didnt like that it took about 30 minutes for our tacos to come out. there were only 4 people in line. Not sure why it took so long.
Tacos Michoacan,3,Al pastor is perfumed with cloves and pineapple. It s one of the best versions I ve had in town. This truck is only open for breakfast and lunch  unfortunately. but it s worth playing hookie from your 9 to 5 to taste their stellar handmade tortillas  perfectly cooked meats  fiery molcajete salsa  and all the little extras that only someone with a love for what they do can give you.
Tacos Michoacan,4,Love this place  Makes me feel like I m back in Puerto Escondido with my dad. Really authentic and really damn good 
Tacos Michoacan,5,It s unclear whether the name is Rico s or Michoacan  but either way we had really good breakfast tacos. Hubby and I had bacon egg  sausage papas  chorizo egg papas with cheese on some. Total was  8 which included the tax. Not overstuffed  but plenty for the two of us. Served us three sauces  2 red and a green... all very good. We were impressed by how fresh everything was. They started coming after we placed our order  and the smell alone was an indication of what was in store. Very friendly  I plan on trying some of the lunch style tacos and corn tortillas next time.
Tacos Michoacan,6,It s great to know there are places in Austin like Tacos Michoacan. I d been about to eat from a taco truck on the same block  but when I tried to order  the gruff man who seemed to be working directed me into the neighboring convenience store. The truck was closing  and apparently they sell their  pre-made  tacos at the shop. But I wanted a hand-made tortilla  and to smell the meat cooking on the grill as I waited in eager anticipation for my taco  So I stuck to my original plan and headed over to Michoacan. The woman working there could not have been nicer. She explained that fajita meat is softer than the meat I d originally ordered  bistec   even offering a taste so I could see for myself. She told me they re open except Sundays  or  unless I have a doctor appointment or something.  The taco was stellar. Handmade corn tortilla  delicious spicy green salsa  flavorful meat. So go give some business to a nice taco truck  one that shockingly hadn t even been on yelp before today  though i ve noticed it in that spot for quite awhile  
Tacos Michoacan,7,Had high hopes along with high expectations especially after trying Taqueria Don Emilio half a block south. Had 1 barbacoa which was poor quality. I am a Mexican from mexico and know its just not the same but that was some terrible barbacoa. Then I had 1 al pastor and it LOOKED delicious. Turns out it was sweet  now this isn t one of those typical Austin lets make things taste weird and nasty and say its good type of places  its supposed to be straight up tacos. Nada mas ni nada menos. but it was so so so sweet I couldn t enjoy it. On the upside the ladies were very friendly  service was fast  and there was plenty of other things on the menu which might be much better. But if you do go  don t have either of those 2 tacos.
Tacos Michoacan,8,this taco trailer is tasty.  i usually get the chicken fajita.  its loaded with grilled onions  avocado  cheese  and chicken.   very yummy  and a very good value at  2 including tax.   the lady that runs it is smiley and very friendly.  she is a good cook.   this place is better than average and much cheaper than the veracruz all natural truck at radio.   fyi  they close at 3pm and are closed on sundays.  check them out  you won t regret it.
Taco Cabana,1,Overall  definitely a  crappy junk food  kinda place  which I really enjoy   Food was good. Definitely lower quality  iceberg or some really pale kinda lettuce quality   fast food style  but tasty and filling. The flavors were really good. I really liked the rice and bean flavors  it kind of reminded me of what I used to get at local Mexican restaurants when I was a kid. I don t know how authentic or whatever it is  but it hit the spot. The marg was really good  I got lime and it was a good combo of sweet and tart. It comes as a cup and a single serving shot in a bottle.  The person making my meal double checked that I got the bowl filings that I wanted  which was nice. I m guess they call your number and put your food on the counter when it s ready  but it wasn t super clear and I missed it the first time they called it  so keep an ear out  or just hover at the counter til you have your food.  Compared to Chipotle  the other fast food Mexican place I frequent   food quality was lower  I enjoyed it more  it s more like junk food   it was cheaper  and a smaller portion. Chipotle guac is always better than anywhere else though.
Taco Cabana,2,The lazy people at this location act like it s an issue to take your order. If you don t want to work  go on welfare. I m sure you ve been there before. Plus  asked for a Dr. Pepper  then this mush mouth lady lies to me and said we only serve Pepsi products. But when I get to the window  there is Dr. Pepper right there. Then I asked to pay with Apple Pay  and she said they don t take Apple Pay. Seeing that my card was compromised at this exact location  I decided to drive off. But then I checked their website about Apple Pay. Here s what I found below.
Taco Cabana,3,Let me start off by saying that when I come to Taco Cabana I m not looking for authentic Mexican food  so I know what to expect. However with that said  this is by far one of the WORST TC    Granted we came 30 minutes before closing however the rule in food service is the last meal should be just as good as the first meal.   When we got to the drive thru there was one car in front is us  placed what I thought was an easy order and proceeded to the window. The young lady at the window looked so confused so when she finally opened the window  I repeated my order to her again. She nods her head and takes my money. She comes back and hands me my drink - now the cash drawer is still open and I haven t gotten my change yet. So I say can I get a receipt and my change and she s like  oh yeah    At this point she closes the window and takes off with a box I guess looking for who it belongs to. She goes to both doors looking for someone when she finally realizes it s my quesadilla. She hands it out to the window and tells me to pull up for the rest of my food to be brought out. Also at this time  the guy behind me gets impatient and reverses out of the drive thru like I m holding up the line but I m still waiting on my food.   So I m sitting there and it s been about 5 minutes and there is another car behind me. I get out of my car  walk to the window and she s looking at me like a deer in headlights. I ask  can I get the rest of my food   And she s so confused because she doesn t even realize I m missing food. A guy walks up to the window and asks me what am I missing and I proceeded to tell him. He assured me he will have it right out. At this point it s been more than 10 minutes since I placed my order and when he finally brings it out I ask - does sour cream come with the quesadilla   Uh  no ma am  we ran out  - salsa  Anything  He suggested some guacamole. At this point I just want to get out the drive thru  I thank him and leave. However then I realize they didn t provide any utensils for the rice and beans.   As I said  yes it s near closing time  however I need TC to step it up a few notches.
Taco Cabana,4,Well dad to say but the taco cabana that existed pre COVID is no longer. We went yesterday afternoon and found a very limited main and childrens menu.  No salsa bar and generally a stark environment for dining. Everything is in to go containers for simplicity I guess. Crisp taco were good enchilada was tough on the bottom. In the future we will go to Taco Bell it s less expensive and although the quality of food is a bit lower it will be our choice.  I understand taco cabana was bought out by a new company but maybe they should revisit the menu.  We won t be back
Taco Cabana,5,Open your lobby. Stop using the excuse of COVID and pay enough to hire the personnel needed to run the lobby and if you need to put locks on the bathroom to keep out homeless do so.
Taco Cabana,6,Never open. In restaurant dining isn t available only drive through. Took over half an hour to get my food from drive through. Ownership clearly doesn t care about this location. Plus they never have tequila for margs.
Taco Cabana,7,Contrary to the posted store hours online AND the sign in front of the door this place is not open. 6 50 on a Wednesday and the front door is locked. Rip to taco cabana. No sign saying why. Just a locked door. Kinda how I have locked my heart now that it s been broken by taco cabana. Rip
Taco Cabana,8,Why are the South Austin Taco Cabanas open then closed open then closed for indoor dining    What is going on here  
Taco Cabana,9,Good fresh food at a good price and fast. Had the chicken fajitas and a bean and cheese taco and will definitely return to this taco cabana
Taco Cabana,10,Intended on dropping by just for their  2 frozen margaritas  they have 12 flavors available   and ended up getting chk quesadillas  w  pico  and nachos.   The margs are a really cool deal  comes with a shooter of tequila so you know just how much booze you re getting and stayed chilled for quite awhile which was nice.  All of the food turned out great  I ve had some of their chk guisada  amp  beef fajita tacos in the past and it s pretty good for the price point and how quick the orders come out. Something about their flour tortillas is really nice as well  makes for good food  
Taco Cabana,11,I go to this location every morning before work. The food is consistently delicious. The staff is kind and has gotten to know me and my order. I would recommended this location to anyone. Thanks guys  
Taco Cabana,12,If I wanted a Pico de Gallo quesadilla that is what I would ve asked for. But no I asked for a chicken quesadilla  which was 90  Pico and 10  cheese and chicken. Ridiculous. Man working the Drive through was very cold also and said almost nothing to me. Y all need to realize if you want customers to keep coming back you need to give them what they want    Which is chicken on a chicken quesadilla.
Taco Cabana,13,It was my first time here to tace cabana. My expectations  weren t very high as its fast food.  The prices were a little high for a restaurant to have a drive thru. I ordered 2 steak fajita tacos and a chicken quesadilla. The tacos weren t good  but also weren t bad. About a 4.5 10. And the quesadilla were a little bit better. Maybe a 5.7 10. The food is better than taco bell  and a competitor in Mexican fast food. I probably would look for better authentic options next time  if time provided.  So if you re ever in Austin and looking for tacos  I d rather you sit in a restaurant and enjoy a meal. But if all fails  this place is an optuon
Taco Cabana,14,They refuse to open their doors and let us inside to eat  why  I recently took a trip north and saw a lot of their restaurants were also closed. This used to be the pride of SA and a great place to eat now it s just another drive thru with just ok food.
Taco Cabana,15,Went through the drive thru. Big mistake  The line was hardly moving. Finally made it to the window. I ordered 2 cucumber lime Margaritas and 2 lime. They gave me ALL lime then didn t even fill 2 of them half way. When asked to add more of the mix they looked upset and one worker said something like that BITCH. Really  That s how y all treat customers  Never will we go to that slow taco cabana.
Taco Cabana,16,I love taco cabana. They had so many flavors of the frozen margaritas today I ordered the prickly pear and it was so good  Ordered my steak taco combo and it was just as good as each time.
Taco Cabana,17,It s Taco Cabana. I always make sure I hit Taco Cabana at least once when I m in town. I know  I know  it s fast food and probably pretty gorky. It s probably no worse than Taco Bell but I only go there about once a year also. Maybe less.  But my daughter worked at the Taco Cabana on Guadalupe the first time I came to visit her and I spent a lot of time in there because I would drop her off and then hang out in the patio area  which was open air  but closed-in so that my then toddler  now an adult  could run around safely without me having to constantly pull her away from things. I would sit and have one or two margaritas and just enjoy being in Austin.  So for me  stopping in at Taco Cabana is a Sentimental trip  not just a stop for food and drink.  I was driving home the other night and got a craving for a cold drink   Margarita   Taco Cabana experience so I stopped at this one because it was on the way to my daughter s. There weren t very many people in here. The clerk wasn t super friendly. But I can be very self-motivating when I decide to enjoy myself. I ordered the three street tacos plate with chicken ranch tacos  had my meal on the patio  took a beautiful picture of the food  enjoyed my  3.50 margarita very much  ate everything on my plate and enjoyed it.  I appreciated yet again the fact that you can get cilantro from the salsa bar so if you re like me and love cilantro you can add the extra onto your meal. I hung around for a little bit Yelping and Facebooking  then headed back to home base at my daughter s. I had no tummy problems that night or the next day from it. With fast food  you never know.   All in all it was a very positive experience and I would come back. I always found it fascinating that a fast food place offered alcohol because no fast food establishments where I m from do that.
Taco Cabana,18,Since the 70s  taco cabana has been my family s go-to for tex mex food. They ve been consistently good. Now  since the family has sold out to a big California conglomerate  the changes They ve made to the menu and service are enough to make me want to picket every store. Yesterday  first off  the take out boxes are smaller. We got taco plates and an enchilada plate. There was a scant quarter cup of rice  clearly scraped up from the bottom of the pot with burnt crispy dry bits of rice. While small  the beans tasted the same.  The tacos were good. The cheese enchiladas were horrible. There was a log of cheese rolled up in the tortillas  with a tablespoon of sauce. The cheese wasn t melted. The flour tortillas  a cabana mainstay  were good  but noticeably smaller. We are looking for a new go-to for our tex mex fix  Save yourselves  Don t go to  Taco Cabana 
Taco Cabana,19,Hands down the worst counter service drive thru I ve ever experienced. I pull into the Drive-Thru with 2 cars in front of me. 40 minutes later NONE of us still had our food   I go in and ask for my money back but they said it was almost ready. Another 15 minutes pass by and I legit couldn t believe they would make me pay for this meal. So I just walked out and had my Bank challenge it since I never got my food.  The people who work the night shift just don t care at all. It s unreal the owners haven t been alerted of this.
Taco Cabana,20,Spiffy service and they are rapid...their selection of your menu choices.veggie  chicken beef or combo are awesome  
Taco Cabana,21,This place is horrible. I m surprised that they are still in business. How come the other Taco Cabana s don t need a code to unlock the door but this location needs one. The rude cashier who took forever to come to the front said that I needed to buy something to get the code.  I will never step back into this location ever again. It s above me now.
Taco Cabana,22,I waited in line for 27 minutes to order at this woefully woefully understaffed restaurant. Another thirty minutes for food to be ready. That is just under one hour total.   I asked for my money back as I had an appointment and couldn t spare any more time. They refused to return my money claiming food would be here  any minute.     An hour.   Do not make the mistake I made.   Eat elsewhere.
Taco Cabana,23,I was going to grab some chorizo  egg and cheese breakfast tacos but they aren t serving breakfast yet      WTH it s 4 30 am    
Taco Cabana,24,A client bought a box of breakfast tacos and this was pretty good for what I felt like was a fast food joint. The scrambled eggs were fluffy but the bacon was extremely soggy. It reminded me of a McDonald s breakfast.
Taco Cabana,25,I was filling up my vehicle with Super Unleaded fuel adjacent to Taco Cabana and realized some fuel was needed for me this morning after the exhausting search for the premium gas. A hot cup of coffee while waiting for the order was good and the two breakfast barbacoa tacos with my additional toppings from the fresh stand made the morning. Those folks at TC crank out the breakfast tacos and still provide good service. This is a peanut safe place for my son Jake.
Taco Cabana,26,It s hard to be disappointed with Taco Cabana  however.....who put SOME salsa in the to go containers    Notice I didn t say who FILLED the containers because they are nowhere close to being full. It looks like I already ate a taco with how much space is in the thing    
Taco Cabana,27,I went through this Taco Cabana drive through on my lunch break today. I ordered a Steak Fajita Quesadilla with no Pico. The order taker repeated this back and the screen displayed my order correctly.  I waited in line for 10-15 minutes  and there was clearly a lot of confusion happening when I got to the window. I confirmed with them several times about my order because the person at the window told me I had a Chicken Fajita Quesadilla.   Rae  who took my order and said she remembered it  opened the box and looked inside before she handed it to me. She said it was correct and confirmed that it was a Steak Fajita Quesadilla. SHE LOOKED AT THE CHICKEN AND THEN BLATANTLY LIED TO MY FACE  and handed me the wrong food. On purpose.   I opened my box as I left and immediately went back. Out of time  I asked for a refund and received it.   There are just about no decent Taco Cabanas open anymore. I give up. Taco Cabana has lost a long-time customer. Your employees don t care about customer happiness  and that s a huge problem.
Taco Cabana,28,Long story short  there was confusion in how large my fajita order was  and Olga  a night manager  offered to make it right.  When she finally said   come in and we will fix our mistake  all the stress went out of the conversation  and I became happy again.  I don t really need to go back in and fix anything  just the offer was enough to make the world right again.  FYI  Medium   Full which is 12 oz of meat.  Large   Grande which is 16 oz of meat.  Full and Grande are terms you will find on the menu.  Big differences in price of steak and chicken  and I think there is even a way to just order the meat as well.  Take all that into account and you ll be just fine   What I learned  food is medium good  compared to what you can prepare yourself  and very good versus what you will find at most fast food places.  Service at this location was really slow  so that s why I m dinging 1 star.  I mean  I could have literally have driven to wheatsville nearby  bought organic fajita meat  almost came home and cooked it in about same amount of time  for same amount of money or less.  Might do that next time     But thanks for following the golden rule about customer service   It really made my day.
Taco Cabana,29,2 straight times I have had to wait more than 30 minutes to get food at 10 30 a.m. it s not even busy they have made me late for my kids school lunches twice there won t be a 3rd time I hope this restaurant closes if you can call it that. Below 1 star
Taco Cabana,30,BEWARE when you are in the drive-through because there is a pole that isn t visible if you are driving in a bigger car or SUV and I hit it. The paint on the pole is coming off so I m not the first person to hit is and now my brand new car needs to be fixed.   
Taco Cabana,31,I was so excited to eat at taco cabana after years of being too far. I ordered online to go. Curbside. When I got home my food was ice cold. Not tepid. Ice. Cold. I live fewer than 10 minutes away. I put it all in the microwave for more than a minute and the beans were still cold in the center. I didn t get the side I ordered. I didn t get the pico I ordered. I did get two tiny bottles of tequila. Lol. I m a recovering alcoholic  if you want them back.
Taco Cabana,32,This specific location of Taco Cabana is the worst one I ve been to. I ve been twice at two completely different times of the day. Neither time was busy but both times I waiting a ridiculous amount of time for  not so  fast food.  Also  the 2nd time  I ordered bean and cheese tacos which normally come with lettuce and tomatoes and I got a tortilla with beans on it. What  Also  why did that take 20 minutes  Maybe they were trying to remember what else should be on there and eventually gave up. Will not be revisiting this location.
Taco Cabana,33,Still a mess  still providing the wrong order and food that is hard as a rock. Very simple order yesterday  bean  potato and cheese tacos. Rice was never part of the conversation but I did ask if the potatoes were fresh and was told yes. I get home and my tacos are beans  hard icy cold potatoes and rice. I was pretty much over it as Taco Cabana never fails to give the wrong order. I don t get how they mess up the most simple of requests.
Taco Cabana,34,Want to be the 2nd person in line and be overcharged  Then this is the place for you.  Damn drink lids dont fit the cups no matter how much bull shit excuses you give me.  Charged for sour cream on the flauta plate when it clearly says that you get a choice of dipping sauces.
Taco Cabana,35,I pulled in to get out of the rain. I definitely over paid for the quality of tacos I received. Something about the texture and consistency of the steak was off. The tortillas didn t taste like the other taco cabanas. The owners need to come in and fix the issues at this location. Mediocre.
Taco Cabana,36,I just had the worst breakfast taco ever   I asked for salsa  didn t get it.  The taco was dry  amp  the tortilla wasn t fresh.  What happened   Taco Cabana used to have a decent breakfast with good service.  I ll never go back.
Taco Cabana,37,Listen  I love Taco Cabana. They re food always had great quality and is delicious. That being said  I have been coming to this location for over a year since it s close to my work and it is the WORST.   I m sorry  I was really under the impression that this was fast food. In the entire year that I ve gone through the drive thru the wait time is ALWAYS over 10 mins. When a different employee runs the drive thru it usually goes faster  but this guy who normally works the window is so slow. Very nice  but I just want my food fast.
Taco Cabana,38,I have frequented this location for several years now  and it s always been a crapshoot as to what you receive in service and or food quality. My last couple of visits  however  I have noticed a remarkable improvement of both. I believe that the new GM Teresa is to thank for clearly turning things around. Her dedication to the Taco Cabana brand  and her passion for good customer service is evident. Thank you  Teresa  for going above and beyond 
Taco Cabana,39,FIRST THING  IF YOU GET BEAN AND CHEESE TACOS  CHECK YOUR TACOS AND MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CHEESE  Also  I ordered a total of 10 tacos. When I asked for salsa  he gave me 1 cup  I then asked for 1 more and his response was   are you sure  They re 2.5 oz  I still got the extra one  but no fast food should question you when you need a certain amount of condiments. I m tired of them being so stingy. I did go at 2AM  maybe that is the bad time to go. But I was the only one in line. Who knows  Don t say I didn t warn ya.
Taco Cabana,40,I visited on Jan. 17  2019. First off  bathrooms  they are locked now  a friend of mine asked to use the bathroom and a team member opened it for her. One toilet was overflowing  another stall had no toilet paper. So  getting off to a good start. Next up  the food here is bland  rice and beans are hard. Now the thing that grossed me out was  when I went to refill my drink  a dead fly came out of the soda machine. So I dumped my soda. No telling how many more dead flies were in that thing  Their tea fountain was also leaking and they had dirty rags next to the soda machines. With all that said  avoid this place 
Taco Cabana,41,Drove up ordered two Carne guisada tacos.  Don t know why they even call them tacos.  All I got was two gravy filled flour tortillas.  One with ZERO meat and the other with only a sliver.  Drive back to the window and spoke with the manager on duty-she told me that s the way Taco Cabana makes their stuff now.  Little to no meats in their tacos.  Big disappointment.   No offer to remake or anything else.  This was my last trip I ll ever be making here.  You can get a better value from Taco Bell  as bad as that is.
Taco Cabana,42,Rene and Olga were fabulous this morning  I couldn t get my order placed online so I called it in as I was driving. They were so cheerful  very helpful and made me feel like a very valuable customer at 6 00 am on the second weekend of the ACL Festival  I ordered 26 tacos for our swim team and they had them ready quickly and without one complaint  Rene even labeled each one and held a wonderful conversation as she worked. Highly recommend this location  These ladies deserve a raise 
Taco Cabana,43,This location has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The last two times of going through the drive thru  my order has been incorrect. This last time  an employee gave me the wrong amount of change back since she already charged my card and was refunding me the difference. She didn t tell me how much it was that she was supposed to give me back so instead she just said to me   I m gonna need that extra dollar you re trying to take back .  Like I knew how much money she owed me and I was trying to take the extra  And then began talking to another associate about why she didn t know she gave me too much money. Then tossed me my food. After that I ll no longer be going here.
Taco Cabana,44,Gone down over the years.  Meat quality has dropped.  You can tell owners just milking the margins vs the long haul.
Taco Cabana,45,Bean and cheese soft taco with brown salsa    Wow TC... I think there might of been one bean on my taco and absolutely no cheese  The beans were dry and looked old and crusty  Their salsa is off too... it is normally a red color. Nothing about my meal looked or tasted even somewhat good. I didn t finish and threw it away  Won t be going back.
Taco Cabana,46,I am still in the drive through...floutas and a quesadilla and it s taken over 20 minutes and we are the front car. I avoid eating at ANY taco cabana because it takes FOREVER EVERY TIME   I understand fresh food  but this is crazy  And....still....waiting....not even an update...they could have all left for so we know. Worst ever 
Taco Cabana,47,I stopped for dinner to take home and ordered the medium mixed fajita dinner.  Both the chicken and beef were the best I have had at this Taco Cabana in a long time.  They were freshly made and not left over from two hours ago. I know the tortillas were fresh because they made them for my order.  Thank you to the new general manager Teresa.  You are making a difference. I hope you stay at this location for a long time.
Taco Cabana,48,Omg  This place has the worst food ever    I ordered 2 chicken fajitas  they gave me a tortilla with chicken in it   So I went back and asked for toppings   which cost extra  before I tried the chicken   It was horrible    I don t recommend it   
Taco Cabana,49,Service is slow AND awful. Just do everyone a favor and close this location down. Me and someone else just walked out. If you re going to take forever at least make sure the AC works
Taco Cabana,50,The worst Taco C in I ve ever been to. Live in the area so it s my like a one off thing. This location needs new mgmt new employees new something. Save yourself the trouble and go to the one on Riverside its up to par.  As for me they have ruined Taco C to the point that if I need something late ugh I guess I d rather go to Taco Bell which is saying a lot.
Taco Cabana,51,How many bad reviews does a location need to get before some action is taken to correct their terrible service and product  I ordered through the drive  had a simple order of a burrito with everything hold the Pico and asked for salsa and jalape os. The tortilla felt looked like it had been left out for a couple of days it was cracked open so I couldn t eat it without a fork. The beans were old and dry  the salsa lid wasn t closed so it was sloshing around in the bottom of the bag and the jalape os I asked for were diced onions. How does one location cultivate so much apathy and disregard for customer service and stay active  The ridiculousness of its existence is staggering.
Taco Cabana,52,I had an awful experience. I order on line. I always go through the drive tru. I was told the manger said I have to go inside to pick up the order. I have a disability  and it is often hard for me to walk. I do go inside and the order is not ready. They can t seem to find the order  although I have a receipt  and I paid via credit card. Now I have no food  and have to call the credit card people to stop the payment. They are very unorganized at this location 2117 W Ben White  Austin  Tx.
Taco Cabana,53,Just waited 10 minutes  yes 10 minutes  for two bean and cheese tacos. Then had to literally give my food back to them and take my credit card because it was taking so long. You would think they would have just handed me my freaking tacos  but no. Thanks Taco Cabana  now I won t be able to eat lunch today.
Taco Cabana,54,I wish you still took pride in your food  specifically your fajitas  All dried out and similar to Taco Bell. Gonna stick to my local spots like Fresa s  Taco Deli and Torchy s. They care about what they serve. You should award Pete though  he was busting his hump cleaning up the place and delivering orders the entire time I was here.
Taco Cabana,55,As a longtime bachelor  I am a longtime devotee of The Cabana. Who else can provide such great variety of options at all hours of the day  The Cabana can. But  alas their consistently-happy noshing report card has been marred by a big black D- from the southeast Austin location.  I order what I affectionately call God s Meal -- when I began eating at TC  the total after tax was  7.77. Obviously a sign from above. God s Meal is the Three Enchilada Plate  one chicken  cheese  and beef  plus and extra beef taco. So upon having requested my daily bread I am informed that they do not offer chicken and it has been a long time since they have. Two beef and one cheese enchilada are soon handed over in a plastic bag that is somehow full of enchilada sauce from the sloppily-made enchilada dinner. I may in fact be complaining about fast food  but my point is only to ask if any establishment should hand a customer a bag that is less like a food fiesta and more like a full diaper  Long story short  they offered to remake it  but I opted for a refund  which was given.  I did not want to tempt the wrath of Taco God anymore. 
Taco Cabana,56,On a real note... I hate this location. I m not exaggerating when I say they ruin my order every time I have visited this location. My order is never too difficult. My last order was as follows  3 steak fajita tacos  add the works  but no sour cream . 1 steak and egg taco. 1 order of sopaipillas. Medium sprite. That s it.  Instead I received 3 steak fajita tacos with a fuckton of sour cream. A bacon  supposed to be steak  and egg taco and my sopaipillas had 4 squares in the box. All the other locations I ve ordered them from I received at LEAST double that. Also  didn t receive any honey or powder sugar for them. Needless to say I m upset about it. Wouldn t be so mad if this did it happen literally every time I go.
Taco Cabana,57,This Taco Cabana sucks. Terrible food and service  especially for the prices. The last 2 times I went there had a very bad experience. The first time it was a very simple order took 30 minutes for us to get it and the food was very salty  cold  and soggy. The last time I went there was yesterday and the extreme fat girl that took forever to come to the front got my order wrong and put in things I did not order  so I got the wrong food and over-paid. The bathroom was also disgusting and nobody could speak any English except for the manager and the super fat white girl taking the order. Also  they give you a number for your table and then  call you  to come get your food  Why are you giving me a table number then idiots   Bottom line  1. DO NOT GO HERE. 2. Everyone that works here is extremely obese 3. Taco C is way over priced. Go to a little mexican hole in the wall instead. 4. Bathroom is nasty and never cleaned 
Taco Cabana,58,I actually really like taco cabana but this is the worst food establishment I ve ever been to  We pulled up to the drive thru to be told I can t do two separate orders  why not   so I let my friend buy his food and they charged him correct price for everything he ordered but gave him half orders of everything he paid for  the lady said  I threw in some sauces for you guys  and she literally did because they leaked out of the bag all over my car. The tortillas were not only the wrong amount he paid for but they were literally 4 inch tortillas.  Pathetic. TC will never get business from any of our community again. Should ve known better
Taco Cabana,59,Horrible fajita tacos. Dry   . Both chicken and beef were DRY   Also asked to add bell pepper and onion to a fajita quesadilla and apparently thats to much to ask for. They could only put them on a seperate plate and we had to add them to the quesadilla. Not to mention hardly any cheese in the quesadilla.  Only gave 1 star because it wouldn t let me continue with my review.  Waste of  18 for one quesadilla and 3 tacos.
Taco Cabana,60,sadly it seems like one of my oldest and most favorite institutions is going the way of homogenized fast food joints.   i can remember ordering chicken fajitas and getting savory skillet of hot chicken with generous peppers and onions cooked in for added flavor.    today i ordered the half pound chicken fajitas plate... what I received was a half of a grilled chicken breast  not even fully cut up  served with a scant portion of cold sliced up onions and bell peppers server on a piece of aluminum foil.   very unappetizing and not particularly satisfying.     strangely they handed me a roll of about 20 corn tortillas to go with the fajitas    i would have needed to put a single piece of meat or vegetable on each tortilla to eat them all.  i ended up using 2 tortillas and throwing the other 18 away.   another pet peeve of mine  wasting food.    this place seems more geared to quick in and out dining.   i guess the days of happy medium between fast food and full service dining are gone.
Taco Cabana,61,Ordering at the drive thru speaker I ordered 3 tacos and requested extra salsa. At the window she hands me the bag and there are only 2 of the small 1 oz containers of salsa for the 3 tacos I ordered. I asked again for extra salsa and she throws 1 more 1 oz container of salsa in the bag. She had the most rude and nasty attitude I ve ever witnessed. So I ve now gotten what I consider the standard amount of salsa. 1 oz of salsa per taco. I ve requested EXTRA SALSA  What is the problem here  Your employees have terrible attitudes. It s a nickels worth of salsa for a  6 order... figure out the math. Your losing business to greed and terrible employees. I won t be back    
Taco Cabana,62,Seriously  I love taco cabana but this store signal handedly makes want to never even try to visit any location ever again. The first three times I went here they gave me a wrong item each time. And last month I tried to stop here and they refused to serve me saying they were close for the evening because of their credit card machine being down and once I offered cash as payment the employees became ridiculous and rude saying they were closed. Tonight ... 5 minutes ago on my way home from work I decided to give it another shot after the last fail.... And here we go again  I sat in the drive thru for 5 minutes and was never greeted and so I pulled forward to the window... I waited for a minute and then a car behind me honked their horn and a man looked around the corner. He rudely opened the window as if I was bothering him and he said  we are closed   there is suppose to be a man telling people   then he walked off before I could respond. So I waited for him to rerun be after a minute he poked his head around the corner again and just raised his hands and gave me a dirty look. I plan to be the biggest advocator against taco cabana now  so much so I finally joined yelp.  What a shame I loved the food at other locations.
Taco Cabana,63,Ordered the shredded beef plate. The beef was not cooked. Took a bite and found something chewy so I spit out the food and looked  the meat was still pink. A hour later   I have been in the bathroom 3 times. Where is the food quality control    
Taco Cabana,64,Their breakfast tacos are pretty good  along with their cabana bowls. This place has turned around from what it was months ago. Nicer cashiers and cleaner staff.
Taco Cabana,65,Customer service has improve. The quality of the food has improve. The General Manager took his time to ask how my experience was. I will be coming back.
Taco Cabana,66,Ah  Taco Cabana  How I used to love you. In my younger days you sustained me with 2 00 am bean and cheese tacos to soak up the evening s beer.   How things have changed... not sure if it is this location or ALL TC s but.. alas   Tis not the same taco.  Fajita tacos are DRYYYYYYYYYY and the tortillas on the breakfast tacos are... slimy.   This location could stand a good cleaning once in a while... the tables and floor is often dirty and there are always bugs flying around the soda fountain.
Taco Cabana,67,Worst taco cabana is austin. Avoid at all cost  They constantly mess up the order or they are out of something or there computer is down and the list goes on and on. N
Taco Cabana,68,I have been coming to Taco Cabana since the 1980s  primarily for the delicious skirt steak fajitas. Today s visit was a major disappointment I opened up my taco and I saw small square pieces of beef resembling the chunks in premium dog food  they did not taste much better. I asked the manager what happened to the fajitas  why were they small square chunks of tasteless beef  now  He jerked his thumb at a  sign behind him that proudly bragged that they no longer used  skirt steak and they were using some kind of USDA meat product . My patronage of taco cabana officially ends today July 28  2016
Taco Cabana,69,Its no Roberto s    but its ok for fast food Mexican food.  First off service was very sloooooowwww. The place also was not very clean and the workers just seamed as if they hated their jobs so the enviorment wasn t that great.   As far as the food it was good for being fast food. I wasn t a fan of the tacos very skimpy on the meat and cheese as well put like 3 strains of cheese on them. The flautas were pretty good i enjoyed them alot and I also enjoy the fact that they serve rice and beans unlike alot of drive thru Mexican places. So i guess at this place it just depends on what you order it can be hit or miss. I will be returning here to try other things on the menu.
Taco Cabana,70,The worst place to come for dinner. Employees look lost and lack of professionalism. I will never come here again due to the fact that it took almost 45 minutes to receive my order and then my order came out completely wrong of what I ve asked for and paid for very dirty place and not a place that I recommend to anyone to have dinner. Please if you re reading this  and you re on your way to taco cabana turn around and go somewhere else.
Taco Cabana,71,My visit here was purely utilitarian. I was hungry and in a hurry. In retrospect  I should have just hit up one of many Mexican joints nearby. Meh...hindsight is 20 20  right   It all started at the drive up menu. The volume was so low  I barely heard the employee at the other end...so I just ordered blindly  hoping he understood what I said.  The prices are reasonable  so no complaint there.  I ordered the carne guisada burrito. Brown salty mess in a tortilla. It was wrapped shoddily and dripped all over the place. Now  when I say salty...I mean salty. It was damn near inedible.   Curiously  it looked exactly the same going out as coming into my body.  Next time  I ll keep driving.
Taco Cabana,72,Food was mediocre...the pizzazz of TC just wasn t there.  There was a guy who presented himself as either being the manager or a member of management and seemed more interested in having an employee sweep and mop around the areas where customers were eating.  It was rather annoying actually.  I understand the importance of cleanliness but in all seriousness you should wait until a customer is finished eating before rigorously sweeping and mopping around them.  It almost seemed like a tactic to kick people out. I d focus on the food a bit more..Like previously stated...MEDIOCRE.
Taco Cabana,73,I live in CA so everytime I m here  Taco Cabana is a must... I never go to fast food restaurants and this one I think is in a league of their own... This location  I was so impressed with how polite they were... Really great  everyone was so nice. I don t know what every one on here with their negatives comments problem is...
Taco Cabana,74,HELLO IS ANYBODY HOME  This local franchise needs an uncover boss or any boss that gives a chit about loosing business and throwing away product each day. How can you people F up the planets most simple street food   Your comedian spokes person should fire y all cause this aint funny    you people served us burnt black bacon and we re the ones that served it back to you you re fired   
Taco Cabana,75,I don t really like giving reviews on fast food chains because you can t really expect much in the first place but this was ridiculous. I got an enchilada plate and my enchilada was hard as a rock  I couldn t even cut through it at all. It was disgusting. I can t believe I paid that much for something I couldn t eat. It also took way too long for how gross it was. While sitting there waiting I was thinking that maybe it s a good thing it is taking a long time  that should mean it s fresh  NOPE. Oh but luckily they give you free tortillas so I was able to eat a little something. Woo  Thanks Taco Cabana  I feel better now...
Taco Cabana,76,I actually love Taco Cabana.  But this branch is TERRIBLE.  Every time i ve been there it s been a crazy long wait and the food has just been mediocre.  Last time i went there  just a few days ago  this place s fate was sealed.  Never again.  I ordered three things.  Got five completely different things.  Crazy 
Taco Cabana,77,Ran out of steak and didn t tell us until after we waited here for 20 min after we purchased
Taco Cabana,78,For some reason  I have gotten sick the past two times I have eaten here.  I have never had this type of gastro distress from any of their other locations.  I get the same thing every time from every Taco cabana.  Chicken fajita nachos.    I thought it might have been me the first time and due to beers or previous activities that day.  Second time   I was sober as a judge and I was leaning over a toilet within an hour of leaving there.    Fool me once....... Enough said.
Taco Cabana,79,I m going to try to put this as subtly as possible and still get my point across.  I went to Taco Cabana and said   Austin s the capitol of Texas.   Taco Cabana said   No  it s not.   Then I went to Taco Cabana and said   Man  Van Halen I rocks  .  Taco Cabana said   Umm  Van Halen is little loud.  We prefer Celine Dion.   Finally  I went to Taco Cabana and said   Uma Thurman is hot.   Taco Cabana replied   She s not our type.   So I guess you could say when I eat at Taco Cabana  it doesn t agree with me.
Taco Cabana,80,I already knew this was the worst cabana I ve been too. Unfortunately my gf gets home from work late so I ignorantly conceded. She ordered a shrimp casadilla   muy loca  . After her second bite  and multi chews  she pulled a twist tie out of her mouth. She could have choked or swallowed it. After a complaint that was 3 days ago  I still haven t heard back.  ... do yourself a favor  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE            
Taco Cabana,81,I went thru  drive thru AT 2 33 AM ON 3 12 2016  and  I order 6 brisket and egg tacos  2 Carne guisada taco   4 bean tacos and coke. The issue is they forgot to give me my coke have to wait in the long line agained. I live 20 mile away from the restaurant.When I got home  the order was  messed up . All the brisket egg tacos did not have egg in them and the 2 carne guisada tacos did not have any meat on them just gravy paste. So l call the Taco Cabana restaurant at 512-462-3082 location at  6430 IH 35 SOUTH AUSTIN TX STORE 20140. SOME PICKUP THE PHONE AND HANGUP. The brisket an egg tacos looks horrible it s burnt looking.STAY AWAY  FROM Taco Cabana  William Cannon at THAT LOCATION.
Taco Cabana,82,Terrible service  horrible food  dirty restaurant.  Truly a trash pit.  My son and I both felt sick after eating there....won t be back.
Taco Cabana,83,Went today and the chicken smelled so bad. They said it was fresh but it sure didn t smell fresh. I will not order chicken fajitas from TC again.. I used love that place   
Taco Cabana,84,Terrible service. My husband bought dinner  brought it home  and almost half the order was missing. He went back and they  made  the rest of our food. When I got my food  two breakfast tacos  potato  egg  and cheese  the first taco had cold eggs and cold potatoes   the second one had warm eggs but cold potatoes. On both the potatoes were hard  cold  and gross and dark looking. Most pieces were so dark they were pretty much black and so hard that i couldn t chew them and they actually hurt my teeth. I was disgusted. I had to pull out all the  potatoes  and settle for egg on tortillas. I don t have enough gas money to keep going back and fourth for something that should have been done right the first time.
Taco Cabana,85,Yeah  it has the ambiance of a tire shop  but Imma let you in an off-menu secret    You can get a one-taco combo meal for  1.50. That s a decent meal for UNDER TWO BUCKS.  What you get     one taco  natch    tortilla chips  a fair amount of them  too    a decent-sized  I d guess 6oz  container of not-horrible queso OR good guacamole   a cup that you can refill 739 times if you want   access to the salsa bar  several good salsas  a couple of pico de gallo choices  jalepenos  fresh limes  fresh cilantro ...   I mean  c mon. Just the DRINK would cost you  1.50 in any fast-food joint you can think of. And 6 ounces of queso or guac would be  3 or more at another other Mexican joint.  This is an amazing deal  and the food is fine.  One strike against them  though  This location didn t have crispy taco shells tonight. Soft tacos are just not as good to me. Plus they re harder to eat. I might as well just scoop the inside of the taco with my hand and smear it all over my shirt  because that s where it s going to end up.
Taco Cabana,86,I can t believe I gave up my standard p Terry s or whataburger for this ridiculously pathetic excuse for a taco cabana. Talk about falling off  this was the worse experience ever. Long story short don t waste your time  I was once a fan and clearly the corporate evil associated with large chains has once again proven how bad that model is. Awful.
Taco Cabana,87,Sanitation should be a number one priority I was over there this weekend and you had an employee that had two small children in the back which is very unsafe and unprofessional. Also taking the kids to the restroom and returning without washing hands after taking children to the restroom. I ve worked in fast food myself so I know there are signs that say EMPLOYEES MUST WASH HANDS BEFORE RETURNING TO WORK. UNSANITARY     GM  MANAGER PLEASE ADRESS THIS PROBLEM .  I d hate to go elsewhere due to your employees who should know better to be so unsanitary.
Taco Cabana,88,Taco cabana is always a good late night treat after a few drinks or in the morning after you have awaken from those few drinks.  This location It better than others I have been too. This is also the only location where their carne gusida meat is actually Meat   WOW  all the other locations I have been too are all gravy maybe a slither of meat in there somewhere.  No complaints here  Last time I went their margarita machine broke after my 2nd margarita.. Lame I know. The margaritas were a bit like a ice cream or something I couldn t get it through the straw without some effort  And I don t like headaches while I m trying to drink.
Taco Cabana,89,Ordering was very slow. Staff indifferent. Dining room was filthy had to clean our own table.
Taco Cabana,90,Worst location I have ever been to. Tables  floor  and bar were very dirty. Staff was not attentive and the food took a very long time. I will not come here again.
Taco Cabana,91,Consistently rude  incorrect orders  slow  and overpriced cold food. Staff in the drive through is rude and mocks your Spanish. Unbelievably bad service and overpriced food.
Taco Cabana,92,omg best tc location in austin. they were so nice to me and made me feel really like family. my food was very good and people were soo nice to me. love y all
Taco Cabana,93,Speedy drive thru and outstanding beam and cheese tacos. Our drive thru attendant  Brianna was extremely helpful and polite  smiling while she helped us with our order. She seemed very genuine and while some drive thru personnel can be rude  she was a delight.
Taco Cabana,94,I ve probably been to this location 4 or 5 times. As the other reviewers have already mentioned  the drive thru has ridiculously long wait times considering it s  fast food.  It s also expensive for a fast food joint  The food s alright for what it is  but I only go here if I m craving cheese enchiladas and don t have time to stop at a legit Tex Mex place. Other reviewers have said this place is unclean on the inside  and I wouldn t doubt that. Looks like it s on to greener pastures for this enchilada junkie 
Taco Cabana,95,The person that takes the order is so rude  She was being so disrespectful and she didn t even give us spoons  While I was taking my order she continuously kept on saying  oh my god  in a rude way 
Taco Cabana,96,Daughter and I got food poisoning from this location last night. Don t eat here..mess up orders and staff isn t too friendly.
Taco Cabana,97,Don t go here unless you re seeking anger. This is the worst fast food location I have ever been to. It s close to my house and I ve been there several times  they have never gotten my order right. Ever. They are rude and terrible at what they do. Get it yet  This place will disappoint you.
Taco Cabana,98,Never again. Super slow food service. That s basically it. I like TC. Its always good and consistent with good prices. The military discount doesn t hurt either. Though  this location is bad because of the turnaround time on your order. Only come here if you have time to spare.
Taco Cabana,99,Slowest taco cabana I ve ever been too ...always under staffed  I get that at times it gets busy but this is a reoccurring event 
Taco Cabana,100,Very slow and very bad service. I waited for like 18 mins to get my meal  and there were just me and other 2 or 3 other customers in the restaurant. It was not busy at all  Their staff are just all slow.  I guess there was only one person that cooks in the store.
Taco Cabana,101,This place was clean BUT the manager  Dora  was so rude and unprofessional that I decided to leave. It was horrible. She started slamming 3 trays down loudly on the pass then one by one throw foil rolled tortillas onto the trays like a crazy woman. It was really hard to see her behave this way with staff and customers present. TURN OFF  Also  with such few customers  the wait was ridiculously long. I will NEVER go back to that location 
Taco Cabana,102,Slowest drive through. If your trying to grab something before work forget it. Trust me I ve given it several chances. And they always mess up the order... Even though I only order one taco... They forget salsa constantly  an issue I never have at other locations. Twice they left the mic on and they guy taking orders proceeded to curse and curse and sing phones words. Done with this place.
Taco Cabana,103,Taco Cabana has officially gone down hill  Last week  the one on Riverside and s lamar barely cooked my chicken fajitas and it grossed me out so bad  I vowed never to eat chicken fajita meat from them again. I really was not going to go to TC period but... I came home this week and there were BUy 1  get 1 free coupons  Okay... one more shot. Thursday...I go for lunch - buy one fajita taco dinner  get one free...chicken or beef as the coupon states. Steak all the way of course. The new employee did not know how to ring this up so he calls for the manager Felipe.  The manager INSISTS that I have to pick one steak dinner and one Chicken dinner regardless to what the coupon says. I told him that I refuse to eat chicken from them again and I want two beef fajita dinners. The coupons states that you can have steak or chicken. There is no limitation stated that states that one must be steak adn the other chicken. He looks at me and continues to demand that I order only one steak and one chicken dinner. I stay calm and reiterate  no  I want two steak dinners. He shrugs his shoulders and walks off from the register  back to the drive thru and never comes back. So I stand there  looking at the new employee and the other patrons who can not order until Felipe tells the employee how to ring up the coupon. After 10 MINUTES of the staring game  a veteran employee comes off of her break to ring the order up correctly. I thanked her and the confused employee who had tried to help and left. NO MORE TACO CABANA for me.
Taco Cabana,104,This location seriously need to get a real manager in there that cares about the food. I picked up the super nachos and half of my chips where the size of a dime or less.
Taco Cabana,105,My Job is close to this location and I only have in 45 minutes  for lunch.I like Taco Cabana but this location on Ben white was Horrible. I went through the drive through to place in order. The Cashier  says  that the  wait  time will be a while before you get your order  your welcome to come inside to place your order. I m like what the HECK   I m on a lunch break.. So I decided to go inside. I first notice the kitchen was dirty .There was 5 people in front of me and 3 people waiting for there food. The service was soooo slow. The staff was lost making mistakes on orders. It took me about 25 minutes to get my food. This Taco cabana restaurant seriously needs better managers or better staffs.
Taco Cabana,106,Service at times is bad.  No one at the front counter at times.  They make you wait then can be rude.  After recently waiting at the counter  I got tired of waiting and grabbed a medium sized cup. The short black guy who was working there rudely told me not to do that again.  This is after making me wait a really long time    I ll be buying my drinks elsewhere from now on.
Taco Cabana,107,Eat at Taco Cabana if you like roaches in your food. I have been eating at this location about once a week for a few years since it s near my house. Not anymore. I ordered through the drive through and asked for salsa fuego which they usually get from the salsa bar in the front. Since I would imagine most people would see a roach in the food they are about to serve  I am guessing it was in the salsa.   I wonder how many roaches I ve eaten from this place over the years. Never again  Taco Cabana. I ve had all the rude service and roaches I can take from you.
Taco Cabana,108,What a terrible lunch experience  Waited 20 mins for a beef burito  and when I finally get it  the tortilla is cold  as in didn t touch the grill at all  and there was no meat in it  at all .  I notified the employee who made it  and after some confused looks from him  he took the burrito around the corner to fix it.  There was no way I was going to eat anything he took out of my sight to  fix .  Demanded my money back and got the hell out. FYI  I ordered it to go  so that s probably why they thought they could get way with it.  I hate to blast the entire store because their evening crew is pretty good.  The wait is never too long  and the mistakes they ve made on my order were minor.
Taco Cabana,109,I wish I could give it fewer stars.  I ve been 4-5 times and each time  I ve had to wait because the guy at the register didn t know what to do  Each time  my order has been messed up.  Each time  I ve had to go ask where my food is  2 tacos nachos queso    and each time  it s mediocre.  Also  it does not take 3 people to discuss and make a taco.  Also  the female manager should not argue w  customers when the order is wrong. Just fix it  apologize and then fix the systemic problem.  Customers don t care to hear it. She took almost 5 min arguing w  a guy in front of me tonight about crispy and soft tacos.  I would have asked for my money back but I was afraid to hand that guy my debit card again.
Taco Cabana,110,They mess up my order every time. Breakfast is supposed to be ready at midnight... In the past year... Never happened once. Never get a receipt because of  no paper .. So you can t prove their mistakes over and over. Place is a joke.
Taco Cabana,111,This place is beyond sad. Honestly  how hard is it to take an order correctly   They don t allow you to order off of the menu although it s clearly displayed  we ordered loaded queso and they said it s not served although it s on the menu. They can t put food together in a timely fashion  rather  they prefer having people to wait in a drive thru line for over 10 minutes AND not to mention be disrespectful when customers are getting their food from the window to give to their customers. Apparently it is extremely difficult at this establishment. The people at the pickup window are beyond rude and are obviously incompetent to perform their jobs appropriately. When we asked about the loaded queso at the window the  blonde  couldn t remember who had told us that it wasn t available on the menu then proceeded to to tell us they  ran out  but hurriedly ran away from the window due to our confrontation. The blonde at the drive thru is beyond uneducated  to say the least  and should look into being in another profession rather than customer service. Beware of going to this establishment because their staff cannot appropriately perform their jobs at a qualified level of performance.
Taco Cabana,112,A good chain for cheap Mexican fast food  24 hours a day.  Freshly made tortillas.  Not a place to start the evening  but a great place for when you are ending the night.  Why go to a fast food burger place when you can get homemade bean and cheese tacos or huevos rancheros for the same price.
Taco Cabana,113,Rats  cockroaches and mice. Luckily I didn t see any of these things. So that s nice.
Taco Cabana,114,This taco cabana is seriously the worst I ve ever been to. They have never gotten my order right. Also they are super sloppy. One time I was even served crumpled up napkins on top of my food. If you want taco cabana  go to a different location 
Taco Cabana,115,This morning I decided to stop  amp  get some breakfast tacos   the W. Ben White location     NEVER AGAIN  it was an absolute horrible experience    First I got my tacos and the potatoes were so COLD  I went back around  amp  told them about the cold potatoes   amp  she said took the taco back. Another girl came back opened the window literally shoved the taco at me and without saying a single word  just very rude facial expressions  amp  then continued to slam the window  amp  walked off. Excuse me your upset at me       I was  the one who got COLD food   I m supposed to be upset. Opened my taco again to which I find the old potatoes  amp  some new potatoes that had just be added     Wow  the really need to work on they re  Costumer Service. NEVER EVER GOING BACK TO THAT LOCATION AGAIN     IT S NO WONDER THEY ALWAYS HAVE A NOW HIRING SIGN      And to put the cherry on top  I didn t even get my receipt    THANKS TACO CABANA ON BEN WHITE Y ALL GET 2 THUMBS DOWN FROM ME  
Taco Cabana,116,Taco Cabana is great for what they offer.  However  this branch is terrible.  I have been to this location before and received similar service.  I wanted to give it another shot.  I ordered two soft chicken tacos.  The  2 meal.  My tacos were very light on ingredients...as in...it was just a tortilla with minimal strips of chicken fajita meat...nothing else.  Definitely  not what I ordered. Also  the lemonade came out extremely syrupy and way too thick to drink.  To top it off  the pico I requested came out with salsa and they both look like they had been used because the cups were nearly empty    Disappointed.
Taco Cabana,117,Opened a personal quesadilla after ordering at the drive through and a baby roach came crawling out.  Disgusting 
Taco Cabana,118,Terrible service but great food.  Nice people working but under staffed. To the administration of taco c  hire more people  these people are working their butts off and getting      ed at because you don t have enough employees to keep customers happy  this is your fault. I truly felt bad for the people working there tonight  take care of better training and get down to business. You are to blame 
Taco Cabana,119,This is one of the worst Taco Cabana s I have ever been to.  The service is horrible and I know others that feel the same way.  The employees look apathetic and at times  annoyed.  I ve been to this location about 30 times and 29 of those times they ve messed up my order in some way.  Sometimes it s something small like no hot sauce when they had just asked if I wanted some which isn t that big of a deal  but it s repetitive.  They ve forgotten certain part s of my order many times  extra taco or a side of something    they ve given my order to someone else and then I get home to discover I have that other person s order or they act like it s my fault when I don t get what I just payed for.  I have to check my food every time because it s almost guaranteed to be missing something.  The quality of the food is just like any other Taco Cabana.  I go there only because it s an easy 24 hour spot to hit up when I m on my way home and I m too tired to prep something myself  but at this point their inconsistencies are ridiculous.   I doubt I ll go there again  but if anyone chooses to risk it just CHECK YOUR ORDER.
Taco Bell,1,Attempt 1  came here around 8pm to try the nacho fries only to find out they re out of the nacho cheese -__- and it ll be at least a 30 min wait. Since this was on the day the nacho fires became available  I ll give them a pass. I decided to come back and try again the next day.  Attempt 2  came here during lunch to try again. The fries came out relatively quick. It was a bit soggy. The inside tasted like mashed potatoes. The nacho cheese was a good match for the fries  but nothing to die for. I give the fries four stars since they were only  1. I do give Taco Bell props for good marketing and hyping up new menu items. It actually someone who normally wouldn t eat Taco Bell to go out and try it.
Taco Bell,2,Tried to give this place another try. They do not wrap the premium tacos in the carton that keeps them from cracking which ALL locations do. They weren t short staffed tonight but even then failed to make palatable food that stays together.
Taco Bell,3,Taco Bell on Riverside y all should be ashamed of y all selves lol. Do y all not care about the product you offer customers. Who clocked in and said   screw standards . I m shocked someone is paying you to issue this out to customers.
Taco Bell,4,I went to Taco Bell this morning for a Doordash order the employee in the photos I posted literally yelled at me with the most horrible tone telling me I need to go park my car and come inside the store to pick up my order because it s not ready. Listen I don t mind doing that at all but if you are going to speak to me like I m a child and be extremely condescending and rude you bet ya I m gonna get upset. I told her she has horrible customer service skills and she told me  Have a nice day I m refusing service  as if she does this habitually. I have never had bad experiences with Doordash as most employees tend to be professional and kind but this employee just didn t do that. Even the other coworkers noticed how disrespectful she was being and she even snapped at them in front of everyone. I asked to speak to a supervisor and asked for her name and she declined providing any information. She needs to be retrained or needs to resign and go work somewhere she enjoys because clearly she doesn t enjoy working there.
Taco Bell,5,Ordered on door dash and the whole time I was nervous and very iffy because Taco Bell has always given be shitty service and of course they didn t disappoint my food was legit trash   Everything was thrown together and it was very little of the ingredients and there was missing ingredients and literally everything I ordered was missing ingredients and I was missing my veggie burrito  Never again   Don t waste your money   
Taco Bell,6,I gave this location another shot. Showed up on a Friday at 9 30 pm  and they are closed due to short staff. You have no way of knowing unless you show up. Just go get food somewhere else...
Taco Bell,7,PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE CUZ IT TAKES 45 min to get your food on the late night. Customer service is trash
Taco Bell,8,I found a rock in my Crunchwrap. Wasn t expecting A ROCK in my food. So nasty I will not be coming back
Taco Bell,9,This location is the worst.  All the lights are on and it stays they re open till 2am. This location is not open till this time. Employees are either leaving at any time they want or their hours need to be changed.  It is a weekend night. I work late hours and this is one of the few places that is SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN  but it was not.  Taco Bell used to slap but unfortunately  they ve gone to s h e t.
Taco Bell,10,This place will definitely give you curled over  intense gut pain food poisoning. Avoid this store if you value your body  integrity and might as well throw your employer in there too.  Employees here do not cook the food right. Ever. Been living on Riverside for 5 years and 9 10 times I give in to my craving  they do me dirty.  Do NOT give in.
Taco Bell,11,They are not open during the operating hours they claim.  This is my third time here.
Taco Bell,12,Thisi place sucks   I waited along with a few other cars in drive thru. I arrived at 940pm and waited. Before I could order   they closed on us...no warning or anything..not very good customer servuce....service.... again.
Taco Bell,13,terrible customer service took 15 minutes to make one thing then they didn t even make the order correct came during breakfast hours ordered something off of the breakfast menu and was given a CRUNCH WRAP SUPREME everything i ordered on my receipt was correct but made it with the beef  drink i ordered was disgusting. need to do better was not busy at all me and one person in the drive thru
Taco Bell,14,I d give this place zero stars if I could.  These people let me and several others wait in line for 30 minutes before telling us at 12 that they re closed instead of walking outside to let us know like they care about their jobs at all.  I m VERY. ANGRY. Who cares about what pressing matters I have planned for the evening right   Cream of the crop employees  here. Just killing it.
Taco Bell,15,I love me some TB and this one is located right down the street from me. Our order was really not that complicated but somehow it got messed up. Did not receive my 2 chicken tacos and instead got all beef.
Taco Bell,16,Worst Taco Bell ever  Walked into the OPEN dining room that a customer just exited only to be told they are only doing drive thru orders  Not everyone has a car and the big idiot at the drive thru was very rude  I would give negative stars if I could....
Taco Bell,17,Change your damn hours or stop saying open until 1am. None of these bullshit ass Taco Bell s have accurate hours. It s beyond  staff shortage  at this point. How can you have a staff shortage for YEARS at several locations  including this one. It s a joke. Trash ass franchises.
Taco Bell,18,Worst service for fast food. The doors did not have a sign and had two kiosks in to order. The service staff did not pay attention o anyone in the lobby. I stood in front of the counter for 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged me to tell me the lobby was closed after I postered and paid at the kiosk.
Taco Bell,19,Horrendous. I m here at 9 PM on a Friday night and they are completely ignoring anyone in the drive-through. I finally got them to answer the phone after calling a bunch and they said that nobody is working and they re closed even though there are four people standing in there doing absolutely nothing. there are over 15 people waiting in the drive-through line that are very angry. Just ridiculous.
Taco Bell,20,customer service is trashhh this is the first time i came and i did a mobile order and got told to wait at the front and they never showed up  it already charged me or else i would have canceled it. we went back through the drive through and they were rude and said they came out but we didn t see them for the 30 we were waiting
Taco Bell,21,First we sat in the drive thru line for 15 mins not moving  only two cars ahead of us  then decided to go inside to order since you would think it would be easier  joke was on us. Ordered on the kiosk   sat down and after about 20 minutes of waiting in the dirty lobby with one other person   I finally go up to check on the order. With attitude  the guy says  it s been made I m not sure what they re doing with it  . The bag was right in front of their eyes and they gave it to us. Horrible system they have. Having four employees on and it not being that busy  it was just ridiculous. Bad management and bad customer service.
Taco Bell,22,I wish I could give this place 0 stars. I sat here and waited for 40 minutes for 4 items I ordered. When they finally were govern to me 2 of the 4 were the wrong item. To make matters worse I asked the status of my order numerous times and the only response I got was the cashier acknowledging me for about 2 seconds and then going back to checking people out.
Taco Bell,23,Out of meat and out of beans. At 10 00 p.m. on a Wednesday night. I can t make this stuff up. And we all got trapped in the drive thru when we decided we didn t want rice for dinner. I wish I could add more to this review but I have nothing more to add other than I lost 10 minutes out of my life. Ridiculous.
Taco Bell,24,Ignore their hours  signs on the building say drive thru closes at 8 pm  and even at 7 30 the people working sometimes just ignore you so they can wrap it up and go home. Whoever owns this place needs to pay their employees enough so they actually do the job.
Taco Bell,25,classist af  wouldn t serve us bc we don t have a car.  boooo we just wanted a baja blast because we have been walking and were so thirsty.
Taco Bell,26,I waited at the drive thru for 30mins NO Sign and just to find out that it was closed we asked the lady to put a sign at the speaker and she kept saying so ok and and there was a whole line then she closed the door on my face
Taco Bell,27,Absolute garbage service. Anytime I ve tried ordering from here at night  later than like 7  there s always issues especially through delivery apps. I recently ordered through UberEats and ended up waiting nearly two hours for absolutely nothing  the store decided to just shut down . Makes no fucking sense
Taco Bell,28,It s a Taco Bell... I mean whatcha want   However  I swear no matter how high their employees are getting on their breaks... it s gotta be purposeful how often they give me beef... when I order CHICKEN     I don t eat beef      I keep getting it when I go through the drive thru    It is almost comical  that because of proximity to my home and crazy schedule  I keep going back to this location... ordering chicken... and getting BEEF       ARrrrrghhhhhh        Pull it together   I ordered MF GD Chicken         
Taco Bell,29,I went today  Friday  for a DoorDash order on the drive through around 9pm and there was a long line  people behind me  etc and NO ONE was answering the phone  the speaker  no one was at the window. Just made waste my time  It s ridiculous how the employees here just SUCK. I get that it s just a fast food job but if you can t even handle that then what are you doing with your life.
Taco Bell,30,Worst Taco Bell I ve ever been to. I called ahead and asked if they were drive through only  they said yes and let us wait for 20 minutes in their drive through line only to tell us they re no longer accepting drive through offers. WITH 10  PEOPLE BEHIND US IN LINE. This is ridiculous. Worst service ever. I m so disappointed.
Taco Bell,31,This is seriously the best Taco Bell I have ever been to. As a vegan  I often have complicated orders with substituting meat for beans and removing the cheese. They ve never messed up. They always have the most amazing proportions of everything. The person taking orders is always so thorough and with the program. I ve been to many Taco Bell s in my life and this is honestly my favorite. I come here at least once a week. Thank you Riverside Taco Bell team
Taco Bell,32,Anytime after 10 PM. They re saying we close only this location at Riverside every day their hours change    what time do you close exactly    When I go there is always worker inside and they keep tilling me we close  One day at 10pm one time at 11pm one  day at  12 am and online  say at 2am I will suggest you find you someone wants to work. Thank u
Taco Bell,33,Yo these ladies were purposely rude af to me  I order online and when I got there she told me to wait a sec when there was literally mo one In line  and tells me she s ready two sec later     Tf     And when I get there she tells me awkwardly Like they only have inferno sauce or whatever like she was lying and trying to get me to get the hottest sauce   and NOTHING IM THE ORDER WAS MADE RIGHT  everything had bits a pieces missing  whoever this two ladies working at like 10 o clock in March 22nd 2021 need to be fired cuiz they really don t take there shitty job that seriously. Never going back to this location.
Taco Bell,34,worst taco bell ever. the employees close the store whenever they want to  beware of this taco bell i repeat BEWARE this is the worst taco bell in austin so steer away   hopefully they ll go outta business one day.  amp  the  manager  never reaches out to you either. terrible customer service.
Taco Bell,35,There was an unfortunate stocking issue that affected our order and Eric and everyone on the night shift did everything possible to make it right and went above and beyond  We greatly appreciated their efforts and it made our meal even better  
Taco Bell,36,Trash. They will ALWAYS leave out your cinnamon twists and sauce if you don t double check and go back to the store for them. They close early all the time despite their online hours. The food looks like it was left under a warmer all day.
Taco Bell,37,Always busy  this Taco Bell is my favorite. Good  friendly customer service and they re always hustling. No slackers here.  Aaaaand  the foods consistently good.
Taco Bell,38,check your bags before you leave the store  because the employees won t.   constantly missing items. I m sorry but I work in food service it s not hard to make sure it s all there.
Taco Bell,39,During this day a employee helped a choking child    and the food was amazing the sweet tea was exalent it was so good we had to refill it 4 times
Taco Bell,40,They forgot a item I ordered and it took me half an hour to get to the drive through windows when I looked through the items they forgot something I tried called the restaurant and I tried knocking on the door and no answer they are the worse customer service ever
Taco Bell,41,It gets three stars because it s exactly what it is  average. I m more successful than you anyways  so you re going to read this review and have a fucking opinion on it nonetheless  go here if you want something that reflects your life  mediocrity.
Taco Bell,42,always something happening here. i pulled up to order to go and the person manning the window informs me there is a 25 min wait. I ask what happened and he says  we re under staffed  it s 9pm on the weekend and this location is open till 12. on top of that the drive they doesn t have an exit so i was stuck in line.
Taco Bell,43,Yes  I must say  on a recent trip to this Taco Bell I had a really nice experience and have to give credit where credit is due - - specifically for the polite  patient  and accommodating customer service I received one recent Thursday night at the Drive Thru from a new employee named Jessica.    It s late  I kinda got the itch for something Mexican  quick  n cheap.  Yeah  I know what you re thinkin  - - but Mamacita wasn t around and that s not what I was referring to.  I m talking about making a run for the border and maybe trying that new Loco Taco or the new Beefy Crunchy Burrito.    I ve been to this location more times than I should  and I ve generally had good experiences all around.  At times the service can be inconsistent  and sometimes not that friendly  but the food s solid and consistent and I go in with no expectations on customer service.  At the drive thru a lady starts talking through the muffled speaker and asks for my order.  She is polite and patient as I put in my order for that BCB.  Then she throws in a loop and asks me  would you like to donate  1 towards my college education  .  I was like  WTF  .  She repeats it and I still can t make it out  due to the muffled speaker  so I tell her I think I ll pass and head up to the window.  Still  the curiosity is getting to me - - I thought she said  my education .....turns out  she did.    At the Drive Thru window out pops a nice young girl with a big eyes and a pretty smile and greets me w  a friendly  hello   - she s quite chipper this late at night and she s very polite and courteous  her name is Jessica.  I said she sounded different than the lady on the microphone  her response was that wasn t her  it s her boss Diana R.  does  R  stand for  Ross    and she was in training.  I asked about the  1 donation script - - was that for reals    Yes    said Diana Ross   it s to help me graduate college w  my degree  and it s never too late to get your degree  .  Donna s right - - it s never too late to invest in yourself.   I ask Jessica for elaborate but now there s a queue of cars waiting behind me. Instead of getting stressed out or trying to push my order out asap she patiently explains the details - - the  1 goes into a fund that is used to support those who are going to college.  I ask how it s going - she said it s  so-so   and if I d like it to go to Diana Ross then I just need to sign my name on this form and put her down.  Sounds like a good investment to me  I ll pitch in.    Had Jessica not been so nice and patient and courteous during that transaction  I would have likely not donated anything or even asked about it.  Just think if we had more people like Jessica and Diana Ross - who were kind  patient  courteous  and professional - it would be a much better place.  Great job 
Taco Bell,44,I just wanna say that I don t ever eat fast food because I m a chef but everytime I go to this location there is always something wrong went the other day a pulled up only to here the cashier say we are only doing no more then 5 items lol who ever the owner is I just wanna say they are such cheap bastard for not hiring workers every time that I ve gone they are never fully staff just got a cashier and a cook 2 people to probably serve a 100 customers through there 7-10 shift please shut this place down because it is so embarrassing that your staff won t make a taco party pac because it s more then 5 items get it together and I hope the manger or owner reads this YOU SUCK sell this place already or take a dam management course lol
Taco Bell,45,I ve always had such a great experience at this place. It was 3am and I tried going to taco Cabana. It s supposedly a 24hr place but it wasn t open  however taco Bell  which was supposed to be closed  continued to take our order
Taco Bell,46,Terrible Taco Bell  cashier can t do simple math and unwilling to substitute more rice for when removing sour cream  cheese and lettuce....did rice become a precious commodity at some point 
Taco Bell,47,Here s a first  you arrive at Taco Bell to find they are  out of beans and meat.  What can you get   Rice.  No apology for the inconvenience  just the most expensive rice you will be charged for in the US
Taco Bell,48,The woman doing drive through tonight at 11  45 was the best. Not one issue. Perfect example of a good employee who is polite and efficient. She handlers a while line of cars perfectly and for that I thank her for my burritos.
Taco Bell,49,This Tacobell is the worst place I have ever been. I don t think I have ever been to a place that is out of more things more often than this place. If I had to wait longEr for food at a drive through it would be a sit down  restaurant. Honestly the management needs to get it together at this location because it s always the worst when I visit. I hope this location goes out of business so no one as to experience a terrible place
Taco Bell,50,The food quality and service have taken a downward turn over the past year. At the drive thru  the food came out so poorly packaged that crunchy tacos were crushed and one was completely opened with contents spilled all over the other food  making those paper wrappers tear and the food inside became wet and cold. Very unappetizing.
Taco Bell,51,Went thru drive thru last night and was met with a employee that was rude and I felt rushed. The drive thru wasn t busy and they don t close until 2 00. This took place around mid-night. If there was an escape lane  I would ve used it  The other Taco Bell s in the area closed at 1 00  so I chose to stay. The guy had a beard and tats. I know this is Austin...that s half the people here  The store manager knows who he is.
Taco Bell,52,I m only making a review about Taco Bell bc I feel bad for the staff. Sat for 20 mins which is fine  I wanted my T Bell lol but then when I got to the order thing nobody said anything for like 5 mins. So I said hello   amp  the dude was like  it ll b a 10-15 min wait to order.  I asked why   amp  he was very clearly stressed out  amp  upset  he said there were only 2 people on staff.... ok this is on a Saturday.... very close to downtown .... late at night. Like it s going to b busy    I feel like the management should have closed for the night  those two people cannot possibly handle all of the people  amp  it really just made me feel bad. Also after being told this you are literally blocked into the drive thru so have to wait for like 4-5 cars to leave first..... which clearly took FOREVER. I feel disgusted ANY manager would make these people continue to work with this low of staff  amp  feel obligated to say something.  
Taco Bell,53,All I wanted was a  5 craving and a steak quesarito and this lady comes in BLEEDING EVERYWHERE. The Management NEEDED CUSTOMER ADVICE to put on gloves and sanitize the place properly. I had ordered food before this incident happened and my friend was given his full order AND A REFUND. I am trained in SAFETY AND SECURITY and staff was barehanded spreading blood everywhere. My friend got a refund and his food and I was given nothing. This is a SERIOUS VIOLATION OF HEALTH STANDARDS. The manager on staff would not provide anything despite GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HEALTH STANDARDS. This is a step beyond f  amp 3 d up
Taco Bell,54,They re pretty on top of their game  the food was fresh and neatly prepared while service was fast and friendly.  Not just friendly by 1 00am standards either  they put Chic-fil-a to shame.
Taco Bell,55,Rude and messed up my simple order. Felt personally victimized. The one on oltorf is way nicer.
Taco Bell,56,This is the worst Taco Bell ever   they take too long to give you your order  I ordered 5 tacos like 20 minutes ago and I m not the only one waiting here  they honestly have to get their shi t together 
Taco Bell,57,No idea why yelp says this location is closed today- it s open and serving amazing breakfast     I can t believe I paid so little for such a well made and filling Mexico breakfast     They take a bit longer than typical Taco Bell s with your order but that s because they make it fresh right then. Portions were good  quality of the food was there and place is very spacious and clean. WiFi also good.
Taco Bell,58,Worthless.    No beef and no cheese.   What am I supposed to order then     Not only that  I had to ask 3 times what he said. Your guy kept mumbling and I had no idea what is going on.   I realize no one goes to Taco Bell because it tastes good  but at least you could have the crap that you serve available.
Taco Bell,59,I dont eat out too often  too poor to even do it. lol but this was a better place around my area. The staff was great  it was actually really clean inside  and they get your orders right. Not much else you could ask for from a fast food place.
Taco Bell,60,Gone to this location at twice and both times they forgot half our order.  The more expensive parts of our order at that... I do not believe my luck is this bad to have it happen twice so close together  so someone needs to get it together in there.
Taco Bell,61,Taco Bell is like having sex with a friend s sister  it seems like a great idea at the time and it sort of is fun while it s happening  but then afterwards you feel like your stomach s been turned inside out  you wonder why you did what you did  and you can t leave your bed because you re in so much pain from the sex  I mean the tacos. What seems like an innocent package on the outside is explosive diarrhea waiting for you  looming for you  about to strike at any moment after you indulge. You think it s gonna be okay this time  you tell yourself. I m desperate. I need this. I want this chalupa and you convince yourself you ll feel ok. then you get home and it hits you all at once. the nausea  the regret  the vomiting  the shits  and you curse the Taco Bell gods for another six months until your hungover ass decides it s a good idea again.
Taco Bell,62,Went to the drive through at 145am  I know it s late but we knew the drive through is open til 2  and NO ONE came to us or spoke to us. Literally sat there for the ENTIRE 15 minutes waiting for the employees  who were clearly in the building  to at least let us know they are closing early or SOMETHING. This was so rude and absolutely awful customer service. Sucks because this is the closest taco Bell to me and we loved them for late night snacks. Not anymore...
Taco Bell,63,It s fast food but seriously  there is no effort put in and barely any manners at this place. I only go here when desperate and regret it every time. I almost put two stars but then I remember I paid  8 for a horribly put together  Mexican pizza  and two surpreme tacos which is insane. I wouldn t be annoyed if it were horribly put together and  4-5. I don t know why I spend money here  well I do but it s a mistake every time. I doubt anyone eats here actually depending on enjoying the food anyway. Oh well.
Taco Bell,64,Been here a few times. Service has always been alright and same with the food. It s Taco Bell what more is there to say 
Taco Bell,65,Horrible customer service    The lady was very rude at the drive thru. how are you going to be a Taco Bell with no tortillas and then be rude as hell.
Taco Bell,66,I had to try that Doritos Locos taco creation. It was not nearly as good as I d hoped.     This location provided quick  friendly service at lunchtime. I thought the cashier asked if I d like to  add cinnamon twists for a dollar   so I said yes. But what he REALLY said was  cinnamon twists 4 for a dollar   so I got four bags of those delicious  lightly greasy desserts.  And to top it all off  in the parking lot there was some entertainment in the form of one car stopping  backing up and pushing the smaller car behind it back a few feet. I guess they were mad at each other   Unfortunately I missed the entire episode but what I was was a good show.
Taco Bell,67,This Taco Bell is pretty clean but as far as taco bells go it s not one of my favorites.  If you go through the drive thru make sure they give you all of your food before you drive away  they ve consistently forgot 1 taco every time I have gone through or been in another car going through.  Also their burritos are so much thinner than almost any Taco Bell I have ever been to- I understand it s cheap fast food but at least give me my dollars worth of fake beans  Other than that they are pretty nice and will correct their mistakes on your order
Taco Bell,68,I wish I didn t go to the Taco Bell on riverside late at night. I order 5 Doritos loco tacos instead of the beef I got chicken. Our tostada had a taco shell broken in half. The chipotle loaded griller had two pieces of chicken  and that s not even a joke. I know they did it on purpose because they didn t bother asking to check the tacos.
Taco Bell,69,In a city like Austin  why go to Taco Bell  I did because I was broke. This Taco Bell sucks. Staff are morons. Place was filthy. Bathrooms were nasty.
Taco Bell,70,This Taco Bell location is always very clean and 100  accurate with their orders love the new items they always put out as well. My dog loves the chicken grillers 
Taco Bell,71,TERRIBLE SERVICE. We waited over 20 minutes to order food. The guy taking the order was completely rude. He had a mustache  beard  feminine  white  amp  completely rude  amp  would not respond to us on the drive through. He told us to fuck off. I was with my nephews and grandparents. I HIGHLY recommend to not go to this Taco Bell. They have NO customer service.
Taco Bell,72,I m rating this as a Taco Bell - I m not giving their food 3 stars.    I don t ever wind up here because I suggested it ...  Of Taco Bell locations that I ve been to  the employees here are quick but accurate and nice. The place is decently clean  however the general look of the interior is just kind of depressing. I m enjoying some of the upgraded interiors of restaurants nearby - something this Taco Bell could use.   I had the Nachos Bell Grande  a churro and a small Pepsi. The Pepsi was good  the nachos reminded me of why I don t eat here  it s just not my thing - even smothered in hot sauce  and even as a sugar monster  I didn t even eat half of my churro.  If Taco Bell is your thing  this isn t a terrible location - but you may want to take it to go. The lighting  hard chairs and overall look of the location are clearly still designed to get you in and get you out as fast as they can.
Taco Bell,73,It s rly good I like their beans a lot their lava sauce was dank but they don t have it anymore. Mexicab pizza is my favorite item   
Taco Bell,74,I was riding with my friend Brian on the way to a friend s kiki this weekend  and he stopped here for food. I use the term  kiki  since Brian informed me of its use in the Scissor Sisters song  NOT it s origin  as one queen on my Facebook corrected me   and I now think it is a super cute way to say  party . We ll see how long that trend lasts.  I first ate at a Taco Bell during the late 90 s  around the time they were using a borderline-racist talking chihuahua as part of their advertising campaign. However  I haven t eaten at a Taco Bell since 2004  which remains true to this day. The last time I was in a drive-thru line at Taco Bell  the cute guy I was involved with at the time was upset they had jacked the price of tacos up from  0.99 to  1.09. He refused to pay the extra dime  and he left angry  and without his tacos. It was beyond embarrassing for me  even as a passenger in the car. Since then  I ve been extremely uncomfortable anywhere near a Taco Bell  due to that mortifying memory of a certain cute-but-chinchy guy. Still  I sort of miss him  now he s just somebody that I used to know. Oh yeah. I just went Gotye on you.   I almost  ALMOST ordered the Doritos Locos Tacos  just for the sheer novelty of them. And because Catherine T. commented on my check in with simply the words   Doritos Locos Tacos . But when Brian said they were messy  I changed my mind. I wanted to look nice for the kiki...not bloated  and blanketed in Doritos dust.    Brian ordered a chicken quesadilla. The truck ahead of us ordered God knows what  but apparently they racked up the bill to  25. I suspect that probably purchased one of everything off the menu. At first I thought Brian had been eavesdropping on their order when he told me the amount  until I noticed the large  red  digital sign that displays your order total by the window. If I had any respect for privacy  I d be a little mad at them blaring your order total to the cars behind you. Then again  I bare my soul in reviews for Riverside Dr. Taco Bells  so I probably have very little room to talk about privacy.       The guy at the window was friendly  and a surprisingly good multitasker from what I could tell. It was a busy Friday night.   It was a relatively smooth experience  except for the irritating delay of the pickup truck in front of us  who tacked on even more crap to their order as soon as they got to the window. Next time  maybe they should just bring a U-HAUL and cart away bulk tubs of  meat  and  cheese   and save everyone the hassle of waiting behind them in line at a drive-thru.     Brian ate his quesadilla in the car  while I silently thanked God for protecting me during my somewhat coerced visit to Taco Bell.   Thankfully  it wasn t nearly as traumatic as I expected. I m just a little shook up  still.   But I ll survive.      3 Stars  I suppose.
Taco Bell,75,Do I REALLY need to review Taco Bell   I don t think so but I am anyway.  You got a problem with that   No   Good.  Don t judge me.  Every now and again I get to jonesing for some Nachos that are drenched in  cheese  sauce and covered with  beef .  Typically I feel really gross and needing to cleanse my body and soul.  The 4 times I typically eat fast food at least half is here.  It keeps getting worse and worse but I just can t help myself.
Taco Bell,76,I literally think that this Taco Bell sucks  yet  it is truth. They provided me with yahoo and gmail...y all I loved it. I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. They gave me alcohol and weed. Whatttttttttttt. I believe in God  do you  I loved GOD. You don t want GOD. What s wrong with you   For your GLORY. I will do anything. JACQUELINE RIVEASZ. BREAK EVERY CHAIN. Daresia CARTER.
Taco Bell,77,Absolute TERRIBLE service. Line was extremely long  we waited forever. They ended up getting our order wrong and leaving out multiple items that we had paid for  Since it was 11 at night the inside was closed. The drive thru line was super long and after already waiting in it we knocked on the window t see if they could just give us the items that were missing. They refused and said we had to wait in the line again to get our food   We went around and asked the car at the window if they could get us the food for us  the manager REFUSED to give it to us      Even though we had a receipt and everything  Literally took our money and didnt give us our food  Even though I know it s not a huge de  it s the principle. I can t even explain how terrible of service this was and I would love everyone to knows I will definitely be sending an email to Taco Bell as well as tweeting. I sincerely hope they get it and understand how bad this location is. East Riverside Drive Austin TX 78741.
Taco Bell,78,Fixed an error in my order. Great food  Great service.
Taco Bell,79,The past three times I ve come here in the past twice months the food has been great. The place is always clean and the staff is pretty friendly. This is exactly what I expect from fast food. Best place in riverside.
Taco Bell,80,Went through the drive through. The line was kinda long so I waited a while. When I got up to speaker the girl seemed like she rushing to take my order and kinda rude too. When I pulled up to the window I see this creepy employee just grab some food from the kitchen and pop it in his mouth... Super gross. And wtf I order three items and I get three separate bags... hello  just put it in one. Didn t get any napkins either. Probably won t be back to this one.
Taco Bell,81,I consider myself a bit of a Taco Bell connoisseur  that being said this one is right up there with the best of them. When it comes to Taco Bell there s not a ton to expect  just your basic needs like good food  fast service  and workers that aren t  rude. At this location I m happy to say that I got all three.
Taco Bell,82,Convenient fast place to hit up before going to Emos. They got my order out pretty fast on a Friday night and all the food tasted good.
Taco Bell,83,My Husband  amp  I went there to enjoy the amazing food they have to offer  but I was disappointed in the service. The cashier she ignored my husband when he went to ask were our food was waiting for about 15mins  when their was no one there in front of us. In the meantime  about 5 more people came in to order and they seemed to manage to get their food within a couple of minutes. The fact that they didn t offer anything for the wait was disappointing.    I would probably never go back to this location. But  I can say at least our food came out right.
Taco Bell,84,This Taco Bell is absolutely terrible. I don t consider myself to be high maintenance when it comes to my TB order  but apparently to this location  I m asking far too much. Every single time I come here  I order the same two things. A cool ranch supreme taco  and a bean burrito with extra red sauce  extra onions  add sour cream  add nacho cheese. Every time I visit  one or both parts of my enigma of an order  are wrong. Today my broken taco had no sour scream  and my sour cream and nacho cheese  that I pay an extra  1.05 extra for  might I add  weren t even on my bean burrito. This type of thing happens every.single.time I visit this location. I fill out the online surveys every time my order is a mess  and nothing has ever changed at this location in that last 3 years  since I started going here. So this was it for me. I won t be returning to this Taco Bell until I hear that it s got it s crap together  or ever.
Taco Bell,85,I ordered my food and asked for for sauces Hot and mild. I drove away to find they gave me none. I went back through and kindly asked for sauces. The manager arrogantly pointed to the window saying you have to ask for them. The cashier told her I did. The manager basically threw them at me and did not apologize.
Pollo Caliente,1,Excellent pollo asado  very reasonably priced. Best in the area by far    The baked potatoes are A  also.
Pollo Caliente,2,Update  Prices UP  quality way down. It s the old sad story. We were  looking forward to a great meal at great price. But when I walked in  I was surprised to see the price on my favorite order was up--by 60     So instead of a whole chicken with two sides for  10  I ordered a half for that price. When we opened it up at home  the pieces were much smaller than before. They still tasted good  though not as hot-off-the-grill fresh as before.  My guy is not the chicken fiend that I am. He d been dreaming of their fabulous Charro Beans. But he made a face and pushed his away half eaten. He said    They need to rehire whoever s Abuela used to make the beans before.  The deep rich flavor we d loved was now a bit flat  and the chunks of bacon and jalape o were absent.  Pollo Caliente used to really stand out in the Mexican grilled chicken scene. Now  they re just like everyone else.   I m sad. I wanted to support this new apparently local business.
Pollo Caliente,3,I am blown away by how damn good this place is. It s better than Pollo Regio that s down the street on Berkman. They re one of my favourite pollos asados al carbon in Austin  charcoal grilled chicken .  We ordered the whole chicken meal to share with two people. They had a special going where the whole chicken meal was  10. The meal came with 6 white corn tortillas  two containers of a Jalape o salsa  tastes like Do a from Taco Deli   charro beans  and rice. A whole chicken meal was enough food for the two of us with plenty of leftovers for the next day.  The chicken was succulent  juicy  and flavourful. It was well seasoned and no part of it was dry. Make sure to squeeze the lime on it  The rice had good flavour and was moist.  The real standout though were the charro beans. These are ABSOLUTELY NOT vegetarian. They re made with bacon and pieces of what looked like chicharron. There s a pleasant spicyness that comes the jalape os that are stewed with the beans. I would go back for the charro beans alone.  The restaurant is inside a convenience store and the staff are courteous. Our meal came out within about a minute of us ordering and paying.
Pollo Caliente,4,The food was really good  it was fresh. Half a Chicken  Rice  beans  tortillas  for six bucks. This is cheaper than Taco Bell and it s better for you. I ll definitely go back. SI should ve took a picture before I started scarfing it down.
Pollo Caliente,5,I love this place   The burritos are out of this world good   I can t wait to try more if the menu   Fast and delicious  I definitely recommend 
Taco Bell,1,Stopped by again and excellent service again. Nicole helped me at the window. She ll was very patient with me  since I had to change something I ordered. Very polite and sweet and helpful. She made sure I had napkins straw and extra sauce without me having to ask. Thanks Nicole you were great  The staff here is awesome  
Taco Bell,2,Before the COVID pandemic I had good customer service inside the restaurant. I found it to be clean each time I dined. And the food was always prepared correctly. Now that they are strictly serving drive thru  I can say that it s typically easy to understand the employee through the speaker and my order has always been correct. I don t like  however  that I never get a receipt.
Taco Bell,3,We ordered a burrito supreme - we got a bean and cheese burrito. We ordered a nachos del grande and we got no meat or beans. You need a responsible adult working shifts at all times.  This place sux and is now cursed.
Taco Bell,4,Upon walking into this location  I seen the entirety of a man s anus. I swiftly left the property. This place is disgusting..
Taco Bell,5,Poor customer service. The menu screen in the drive they was broken and when I said I needed a second to look at the online menu I was told I had to come inside by a person who interrupted the person taking my order. It was my first time trying this location and it left a very sour taste in my mouth  will not return
Taco Bell,6,This crap-hole has gotten my order wrong more times than it has gotten it right. That aside why the hell would they bother to bring back the Mexican pizza just to be  sold out  all the damn time  FU Taco Bell    FU   
Taco Bell,7,Disrespectful employees and don t wanna help other customers with their order . Talk rude to customers
Taco Bell,8,This location s staff is nicer than others BUT every time I come here my order is wrong. My order is either completely wrong as they gave me someone else s food or items that I paid for are missing. They seal all the bags now with stickers so you can t easily see what s in your bag. I d rather be able to make sure my order is accurate vs seeing a sticker letting me know Taco Bell  took safety precautions for me . No thanks
Taco Bell,9,This taco bell might be the worst one I ve been to. Ordered a bean burrito with jalapeno sauce and chicken quesadilla. They asked what kind of sauce I wanted and I said mild.  No problem pull up to the first window.   Bean burrito is filled about half of what it usually is. Quesadilla has less than 10 pieces of chicken and no sauce.   After paying for my food  I go to the second window  grab my bag  open it up to find no sauce at all.  Can I get mild please    We re out.  COOL. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW BEFORE I PAID FOR IT.
Taco Bell,10,I just witnessed the Saturday morning Shift Manager mock a disabled veteran in front of myself and other employees  teaching them to do the same. She was outright rude to the disabled veteran because of a mistake SHE made with his order  She then proceeded to mock him when he kindly asked her to please give him the rest of his order. I could not believe how hard it was for her to be a decent human. In looking at the MANY complaints already listed here by several customers  I hope the owners  lead manager will do the right thing and remove this horrific employee immediately. Bad customer service is one thing but this lady is literally mocking disabled veterans in front of other employees and customers  We will never support this Taco Bell again and will advise all others to steer clear until some serious action is taken 
Taco Bell,11,They been out of black beans for two weeks but they dont tell you that when youre making your online order. Service speed is fine  but they always forget one out of every eight tacos
Taco Bell,12,Placed an order online where I would go into the store and pick it up. When it said it was making the order  I left my house as the Taco Bell was five minutes away. I got there and walked in the door approximately 8 10 PM. The lobby closes at 8 00 o clock but it did not say that when I was ordering it online. The person who was running the drive-thru who was trying to be nice told me I needed to wait outside. There was another guy cleaning inside as I was talking to him. He asked me what my order was and  they do not do orders by last name  they do it by first  so we finally figured that out and then he asked me to wait outside. About 10 minutes later long after my order should have been ready by the time  I got there he had still not come outside. I went back to knock on the window because they had locked the door and the guy that was cleaning just basically ignoring. Finally  after I pounded on the door a couple more times he looked up and I motion that I was leaving. Came back to call Taco Bell customer service and they are only open from 8 00 AM to 4 00 PM Monday through Thursday. So  everything about Taco Bell sucks and I would never order from them again. there is plenty of local places here in Austin to go to that are far superior not only in taste but in service.
Taco Bell,13,I didn t eat here. I checked in because I needed to use their clean restroom. Thank you Taco Bell. I recommend using the restrooms if you need to make a quick pit stop to Wee Wee.
Taco Bell,14,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE SOMEONE INVESTIGATE AND SAVE THIS LOCATION -7793 BURNET RD AUSTIN TX 78757. I work around the corner and am limited with my selection of restaurants that are within walking distance. I am absolutely appalled and you would be too  Please watch the footage between 3 00 and 3 40  when I left this Saturday late afternoon. To try and briefly explain what I experienced  Drive thru was backed up - CLEARLY they are experiencing a delay or disaster of some kind. Clients in the store were upset and seemed to be waiting long already- being ignored.... Small staff  but one or two waiting for the other to finish before they could  work ... please review camera and the lady dancing around til she was given a task. She could have spoken to the people in line to be sure they were heard and seen  Everyone wore a mask and gloves  while one kid continued to take off his hat with his right hand and rub his head and hair and sweat with the left then put his hat back on his head and continue to touch food and finish packing the contaminated food  Attitude was below poor and the front window area was being avoided at all costs - they weren t interested in speaking or greeting anyone new walking in. The young lady and the gentleman that were talking to folks couldn t even fake happiness if they wanted to. This location just got remodeled and I don t trust that the food quality  the staff that clearly doesn t want to be there  and the food safety. My food WAS ready  and I was ignored  the food was in the bag and left on top of their food station. I tried to be as patient as possible  after yelling at how disgusting the kid with the glove touching his hair and sweat  I got my food over 45 minutes from my order time and at least 30 minutes after it was made. I don t know if there are bugs or how clean the place is itself  but the staff do not know  or practice food safety and they should be fined  They should be fired and publicly scorned for being so careless and disgusting handling food.  a href  mailto echu.service ci.austin.tx.us  echu.service ci.austin.t   a 
Taco Bell,15,I was having a pretty hard day. Drove 6.5 hours on Easter Sunday  my package got stolen that got delivered hours before arriving home  and battled through some other minor conveniences...  Homie  an unsung hero  accident or not  gave me an extra taco. Bless you. Turned my day 180 . Jesus will remember this.
Taco Bell,16,Feels ridiculous reviewing a Taco Bell  but we are so done with this one. The only ONLY reason for going to Taco Bell in the first place is a  it s cheap  and b  it s fast. Not this one. Also   due to staffing  and Just plain rudeness  we ve been asked REPEATEDLY to  come inside to order in the dining room  DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. It s Stage 5 currently and my boyfriend was told to do this last week  not because the drive-thru wasn t working  but because the impatient operator couldn t be bothered to help him figure out what was actually available on the menu when they were out of everything. They basically refused to serve him  told him to come inside  and continued to serve the cars behind him. This was not due to a language barrier or rudeness on his part. I ve also been there during breakfast hours when they didn t even have the right menu up. This location needs to prioritize the drive-thru and think about the public health ramifications of making people come inside unnecessarily and stop treating its customers like actual dirt or we will gladly take our 37 cents elsewhere.
Taco Bell,17,Ellie rules forever. Super efficient  amp  very kind. Even during the busiest of hours  Ellie managed to hustle  amp  pull it off. Thanks Taco Bell. I love you.
Taco Bell,18,I always go to this Taco Bell during the day and they always serve food...Recently I have been going at night for a midnight run bc I know there opened later but when I pull up to the drive thru they never answer and when you go to exit there s always someone in there doing nothing and I went tonight and the same thing happened and I came back around and they dipped and there supposed to be open until 2am. If the hours have change they need to get that updated or something.
Taco Bell,19,TWO THUMBS DOWN   WAY DOWN   second Rudest Manager n assist mngr on the planet-next to mcdonalds...don t know how to run the kiosk-too lazy to take an order even when the place is empty...kiosk software is junk-takes 20 minutes to order a bean n rice burrito-and staff doesn t know how to follow instructions-to leave off the cheeze-so they have to make it 3 x s.  Even when u give them an order because the staff can t figure it out either-because the gm is too lazy to train em...n too lazy to come out n order it for u-when the staff can t-its a rice bean burrito-it ain t rocket science-rice3 bean tortilla-how can u mess that up   and why does it take 20 minutes and 3 staff members to try to place an order on the kiosk for a rice n bean burrito     So then just now-the mngr who was too lazy to figure it out-who I tried to get the hispanic ladies name-who says she is gm-but she s So ashamed she doesn t know how to train  make a burrito  or make a burrito even when They ring up the order after not bein able to figure out their own kiosk     Its actually comical-but be prepared to wait 30 minutes to try to order a rice n bean burrito-i d leave it at that-god forbid someone orders nachos      U ll be there till Xmas   N why wouldn t u give out yore name-the assist mngr is So ashamed that he wouldn t give me his name either-I don t blame em-but it is a dining estab...n I ve never heard of GM s n Assist mngrs-so ashamed of their skills n knowledge that they won t give u their 1st name.

Taco Bell,20,Lol alright  this is like the 20th horrible experience ive had here.  I constantly go here late at night  Midnight - 2am  and its constant excuses.   We dont have chicken  steak  or a fryer.    Theres been tons of times they just dont give me an item i ordered  forget the sauce  or just give me something else i didnt order.  Tonight i went there and the ordered 2 soft steak tacos and i got ground beef tacos.  Normally  if it was a first offense  i wouldn t blink an eye  but after so many experiences dealing with what must be just a lazy staff  i can t hold it in anymore.    This taco bell location SUCKS.  Its bad.  Its one of the only late night options in the area and they frikkin suck.  Once every so often youll get some good taco bell  but most of the time  you re gonna get burned.  Screw this place.
Taco Bell,21,Line took 25 minutes for 3 cars  cashier had an attrition the mic and in person  the chicken tasted like cardboard and the beans were dry and hard  I would give it a zero but I m not allowed to do I give it a one
Taco Bell,22,Me and my friend were super hungry super late  you know how it be  and this Taco Bell location is open until 2 am and it we got there at 1 30  the lady working the drive through didn t help us for awhile which was fine but when she did she told us  we don t have beans  beef or chalupas  which was fine  we just wanted nacho fries  and so we asked if we could get them and she said  we don t have fries either  actually we close in 15 minutes so I can t really get you anything  so we left. I felt pretty bad for coming in before close because I know how it goes but in all the jobs I ve ever worked  I have never been able to refuse service even if it is before closing. Made me sad  home girl just wanted some fries.
Taco Bell,23,The staff working right this moment at this location   killed it. The girl at the service window was fabulous and made sure I got fresh items and the sauces I wanted. Thanks y all
Taco Bell,24,Bad customer service  what kind of business tells you to go back thru because they  have a line     I just wanted to add a dollar item  twists  to my order and was told  NO  we got a line  you gotta go back through. Seriously    With 3cars behind me...  I had exact change and everything... Taking my dollar elsewhere.... smh ...not to mention my chicken quesadilla was swimming in the sauce... couldn t even finish eating it   it was too much sauce...
Taco Bell,25,Benjamin K. was great  The food was awesome - got 2 fresh Doritos Locos tacos  amp  a loaded nacho bell grande with a perfect Baja Blast drink  Don t let the horrid reviews steer you away  I m new to the area  amp  will definitely be back. Thx
Taco Bell,26,The food was disgusting. What a waste  They got the order wrong and just threw the items in the bag.  The meat was so dry and hard to chew. Everything was a sloppy mess 
Taco Bell,27,Bruce BRUCE Bruce he s the man  if he can t do it no one can   Ha   Needless to say he was amazing  you go into a Taco Bell drive thru around midnight and expect the least  he exceeded our expectations   Super welcoming  answered my questions about a taco and the supreme difference. Asked what sauce  we got Fire  there was a lot in the bag  which is what we asked for and what we needed  we EAT IT ALL   Thanks so much team that worked tonight   We will be back  as you made our Taco Bell experience great and we will be back     Xxxxx
Taco Bell,28,We got there just about 15 minutes before closing time. We ordered a 3 taco supreme combo and a cheesy Gordita crunch combo. When we got home we opened the bag and found  1 bean soft taco  2 bean burritos  2 breakfast tacos  nachos  quesadilla and 2 bean gorditas.  
Taco Bell,29,Burp. Fart. Poop. Lettuce. Tomato. It all goes in the same  it all goes out the same. One of the kids working here called me a boomer. I said I am not a boomer I am a citizen of the United Stares. He was a little baby Yoda boy who loved berries and cream.
Taco Bell,30,The wait time is soooo long and they skimp on the ingredients for the potato soft taco. Go to the one by Norwood or on Airport.
Taco Bell,31,Love the food  but this one is constantly run by idiots that can barely do their job.
Taco Bell,32,This is the worst Taco Bell I ve ever been to  and I have been to many Taco Bells. We have never had an experience that meets our expectations here. This location does not meet the standards of other Taco Bells across the city county.
Taco Bell,33,i just like taco bell and the  5 box is the absolute best. more food than i could eat by myself. if you are on a budget  this is a good buy.
Taco Bell,34,Well I ordered food thru Door Dash and they messed up a simple order. How hard is it to take and make an order online   They suggested that I go and get my order corrected. I ordered online so I don t have to leave home.
Taco Bell,35,Really good. I enjoyed it you should definitely go to this place good tacos. Best tacos
Taco Bell,36,Ordered Uber eats and got  50 worth of food  The delivery was amazing but the food was not. We were missing an item and the food was not up to par to other Taco Bell s that I have ordered the same items from. The cinnamon twists had an after taste of plastic. I would not recommend.
Taco Bell,37,No naked chicken chalupa last two days despite it being  back  on the menu. Why even advertise 
Taco Bell,38,Slowest Taco Bell I have ever been too. Only reason we give 5 stars is because we love Taco Bell. This one always takes minimum 10-15 mins to get your food. I have been in here with no line and it took over 15 mins to get our  9 order.....
Taco Bell,39,Just went there  ordered 4 steak power bowls and added chicken  they added the chicken alright but removed the steak   And still charged me the extra  5 for adding chicken  nothing I can do about it now since I live 45 mins away and they re closed  but check your order before you leave  this place sucks  
Taco Bell,40,Just opened up my order from this store.  I am not exaggerating when I say the tacos are empty taco shells also the the double Crunchwrap  Supreme empty as well.   I ll never understand why people do this.  It would be much better if they let you know from the drive thru microphone they have no intention of making your order - then we could just both go on our way - I d eat somewhere else and they wouldn t have to go through the motions of faking an order.  It wasn t even close to closing time so they weren t even being passive aggressive so this one will puzzle me.
Taco Bell,41,Like Wes O. puts it  it is what it is.  Quick  cheap and filling.  I frequented this location numbered times when I worked down the road at DPS and it happens to be the only TB in the central area  They do a decent job at this location and have never had any big issues. Other than the nasty taco cabana down the road this is about as fair decent tacos you will get in the area. On second note it s cheaper than T Cab and not as greasy with a more fresher selection and options to choose from. For lean fast food  this is where to start. The only thing that sucks is their dining area closes at 10  while most of the other locations stay open until 11.
Taco Bell,42,I m not necessarily leaving a review for the food  although it was good   but rather my experience. I stopped in here today with some coworkers for lunch  and the guy who took our order was just a genuinely nice guy. He was friendly and sociable while taking our order  but he really showed that he is a truly caring person when a lady came in asking for a free taco because she had no money. They were speaking in spanish  so we didnt understand everything that was going on  but we asked him as we were leaving and he said he bought her something to eat with his money. I wish we had gotten his name  he was a Hispanic guy. He said he has only been there for 2 months  but He deserves a raise and a promotion 
Taco Bell,43,Unfortunately this is the closest Taco Bell. And I really shouldn t be eating here since I m Mexican. But they have those captain crunch fried bite things and starburst flavored frozen drinks. So I m here at least once a week. This location is pretty awful. Slow service for fast food. And the nacho cheese here is not to be trusted. Doesn t taste right to me.   1 9 16 Sadly I m the duke of this establishment on Yelp. It won t last. It s getting harder and harder to justify coming here. After waiting in a fairly short drive through line for an usually long time  I then waited for someone to come to the speaker for at least 5 minutes. When he came on I could barely understand him. I started to give my order and he gives me a total. I said that s not all. I listed another item or two and he gives me another total. I again said  that s not all. What happened to asking if you wanted fries  or in taco bell s case  beans  with that  After I gave one more item he asked is that all  And I just said yes. It wasn t going to be all  but it is now. So long kingdom of Taco Bell. I was your duke for a day.
Taco Bell,44,Pulled up to the drive-thru  only to hear  Thank you for coming to Taco Bell. I apologize for the inconvenience  but we are out of tortillas right now.   How do you run out of tortillas at 9PM on a Tuesday  Last time it was beans... This place is a joke 
Taco Bell,45,superb. all you could ever want from a taco bell  i go here often and am pleased every time. one time i was choking on my own spit and actually died for 3 min in the drive thru as i was waiting for my food but thankfully one of the employees was CPR certified and brought me back to life so i could enjoy my black bean crunchwrap
Taco Bell,46,Not crowded. Clean. Great central location to my work and home.  Great food   Busy during week.  Sunday at 2 20 is slow and perfect     Needs more positive reviews    
Taco Bell,47,People who work here are complete jerks.  They took very very VERY long to take my order and when they did they were very rude.  I m never coming here again. Not even worth the food.
Taco Bell,48,Why does it take forever to get your food here  Also why is it every time there is a homeless guy sitting in the store with a table full of Walmart food eating every day 
Taco Bell,49,I normally love Taco Bell  but as soon as I tried to order  the woman taking my order was not friendly what so ever and didn t see to want to help anyone. After getting my food  the cheese in my mini quesadillas weren t even melted  but due to their poor service I didn t complain. A couple hours later  both my friend and I were feeling very nauseous and were actually sick due to the food we ate. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TACO BELL ONE BIT   
Taco Bell,50,The food is always 5 5 at Taco Bell. I am just rating the service here. The manager was rude and very unprofessional. I had a coupon for any free taco and have always gotten any taco I wanted at other locations. At this location they insisted it was just a soft beef and soft chicken  which was wrong. Very dissatisfied.
Taco Bell,51,I never write bad reviews  especially when I love the place. But this location has gone down hill.   I worked in the plaza in its golden days  if there is such a thing in fast food . I ate there more often than any sane person would. It resulted in the awesome staff  Richard and the like  knowing me by name and noticing when I didn t come in for a while. They even knew my order by heart.   I went back a few times after I left that company  2 months ago  and every time they ruined my order. Sour cream was out  fine. Creamy jalepeno sauce is out... Fuck all. So just a mini quesadilla   I get home and its a beef soft taco folded in half. I m super nice I swear. I RARELY leave shitty reviews. Let alone on a FF restaurant. But I hope management sees this and takes a page out of the previous team s book.   I m a die hard Taco Bell fan  but when I wanna eat fast food on my cheat days  I hate that y all make me travel to get my crunchwraps... Shame on you.
Taco Bell,52,I have no shame.   It was a cheap  filling snack of three tacos and a Pepsi.  What can I say 
Taco Bell,53,Really rude girls at 3 00 o clock 3 people walk out because they didn t even say hi or anything they just have the poor people standing
Taco Bell,54,This particular Taco Bell is the worst. First of all  they close early every time I ve tried to go late at night. I went tonight and they were closed 45 min before they re supposed to  maybe longer  who knows. Sometimes I go by when it s not even that late and they don t have chalupa shells and tell me it will take like 20 minutes just to get me to leave because they re too lazy to actually do their job. It s always the same tattooed prison looking guy who I guess is the manager and I m not trying to say negative things about people with a record but could you just do your job please  It s not hard to throw a chalupa in the deep fryer. Get it together people.
Taco Bell,55,This location either screws up my order or doesn t have the products to make it. I always wonder how they run out of cheese  tortillas  or whatever item of the day is missing.
Taco Bell,56,I ve been sitting at the wondow   only order   for 15 minutes. They just told me they are out of steak. We ll see how long this lasts.
Taco Bell,57,This Taco Bell is always  out  of whatever it is you re ordering. Why can t you make more beans  You don t close for another 2 hours 
Taco Bell,58,It never fails  when I see an ad for Taco Bell and go and spend good money  I get taken  Do not buy the Triple Double Crunch Wrap. It s just bad. Does not even look like what is advertised   The meat looked like dog food  I went to the TB on  Burnet Road. I wasted  3.79 on 8-8-16.
Taco Bell,59,Always have had great experiences with this location. It s usually quick and easy and right by my work. The service has never been great enough to write a review however today the service was bad enough to write a review.   Bad service and incompetency. Period.   Two people at the mic took my order bc it sounded like they were crazy busy. All I ordered was a Mexican Pizza and a Bean Burrito  no onions.   I pull up to the window and don t get a greeting or even an acknowledgement. Just   Any Sauce   And I told him  Verde.    A couple of minutes later   what sauce again    Verde.    Then I am thrown my bag without a goodbye or a thank you.   Got to work  ate my Mexican Pizza. It was clearly thrown together. Then I bit into my  bean burrito  to notice I chomped into lettuce and tomato. I thought that it might be some scraps that made their way in my burrito but after I ate bite after bite  I quickly realized I was eating a Burrito Supreme. My receipt even stated that I ordered a bean burrito so I don t understand how with an order of two items  only 50  was correct.   Pathetic. Won t be back in a while. Not worth my time or money.
Taco Bell,60,I m not sure why the reviews for this place are so low. I know it s a Taco Bell  but i ve been there four times so far  and I ve always been treated great  and the food is as to be expected from Taco Bell  I m actually pretty impressed with the cleanliness of the place  and the service is excellent.
Taco Bell,61,It s fast food so what can you expect  but I waited at the counter for 5 minutes for someone to take my order  finally a lady came up and brought the biggest attitude  I get it  this isn t the best job  but don t take out your frustrations on me. It was a good wait to actually get my food but at this point I could ve guessed that  my order was wrong  didn t try to get it corrected as I was just done with this place.
Taco Bell,62,Nowhere else on this block can you get an authentic Taco Bell experience.  liveauthentic  artisan  farmToTable  localvore  usa If you want a TBE  Taco Bell Experience  you go here. If you do not  you go elsewhere. You need to make sure you know what kind of experience you want. Don t shop around. Just know. Homeopathy is a lie.
Taco Bell,63,This Taco Bell is one of the best in Austin always clean customer service is very pleasant I have not had a single bad experience coming here management is good turnout is great
Taco Bell,64,I ate here one night after many  many years of not having been to a Taco Bell.  It was fine.  I didn t get sick from the meal.  I wish the ubiquitous sour cream wasn t included by default.  If you don t like sour cream  ask them to leave it out of your order.  They seem a little overpriced for fast food.  The location is very visible and convenient right off Burnet Rd as you approach the Anderson Ln intersection.
Taco Bell,65,I just stated working on the area and normally love Taco Bell but in the 3 times I went  all 3 times my order has been wrong. I called manager to let him know and he apologized and offered to exchange for the right order but at that time I was near by. I said that wanted him to be aware and the I probably will not continue visiting this location. He just thanked me for letting him know but did not seem to really care  in my opinion. I think you should take pride in what you do and this location does not..
Taco Bell,66,I would never eat fast food  places are not clean at most. young employees  could care less
Taco Bell,67,We stopped inside at 702 for a 4 pack of the donut holes and vanilla dr pepper freeze. At 718 I have to ask. 15 minutes for this order  No one cares. Or listens.  I got louder. Saying my order shouldn t have taken 15 minutes.  Guy manager says ok.
Taco Bell,68,Breakfast review  sausage burrito   meh.... not terrible but not awesome. The eggs were buttery and fluffy. There was more potatoes than sausage. The cinnabon bites were too greasy. Big surprise there... the guy who took my order was really nice and pleasant.
Taco Bell,69,This taco bell is one of the worst ones I have ever visited I don t think they have ever gotten my order right... The only reason I still go there is it s a block from my house
Taco Bell,70,I don t usually write bad reviews  but I signed up on Yelp  just to write this one.   I had the single worst drive-through experience of my life at this Taco Bell location. I take my kids for breakfast at 11 15 this Sun morning. Was told they had stopped serving breakfast. Okay  kids asked for smoothies  told the machine was broken. All the while the surly TB employee is telling me he can t hear me even though I m only inches away from the mic  but I hear a lot of noise in the background from inside. He says he has to check on the smoothie machine  says we can have one. My daughter orders a taco and I order a coffee. Then he says he might be able to give us one more smoothie. We pull up to the window and he hands us the taco  then the smoothies and finally the coffee. As he hands the coffee to me  the lid pops off and I m covered in scalding coffee  it goes all over my bare hands and arms  my seats and dashboard and shift console and  I find out later  shorts out the gearshift. The employee s only response was to toss me a bunch of napkins. The employee was a big  mean looking guy who looked like he wanted to take my head off when I complained. As I type this my fingers are still hurting from the burns.  I am never setting foot into any Taco Bell again.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,1,Just your normal mom and pop shop Mexican place.    Ordered la catedral  2 which consisted of a chile relleno and three enchiladas while my son ordered the beef fajita torta.   The food was not bad but it wasn t great either.   Average at best.   Not a bad place  service was good  and they had a musician playing songs during lunch.  All in all  not a bad experience.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,2,I ordered a T-bone the best thing that was on my plate were the beans. Oh by the way do not add a tip on your receipt because they ve already added it in for you at 15  regardless of how bad their service sucks oops did I say that out loud. Very disappointed Will not return
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,3,This place is trash I do not recommend service is bad food is awful and don t add a tip they already made there own price 0 stars if I could
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,4,I went in there with 2 friends  we were greeted right away and attended to. Food was good  but I was over charged and the waitress added a  20 tip to the bill without asking we only ordered 2 beers each and an appetizer to share and the bill came out to  160. We tried to talk to a manager and we re told to come back the next morning to talk about the bill. We didn t want to struggle so left it like that. Food is good but they will try to screw you I ve called and asked for prices on plates and each time they gave me different prices from  10 differences to  20 on an order of 2 plates.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,5,This place is so far the worst I ve ever been in my life  the food was nasty I didn t even eat the caldo de camar n that I ordered very bad service everything was bad I ll never going back
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,6,Literally don t know how this place is still up and running..  went once and I am never going back.  Wait was so long ..  food was terrible.   amp  waiter took 30 minutes to come ask if we needed anything .  And to top it off ..  we asked for a kids plate  amp  was getting charged for a regular size plate  We paid only for the kids plate and left the building and the manager came outside to ask for the money cause she would be playing it off of her pocket After a little argument I realized this was so ridiculous so I just gave her her  5 dollars and left.  I ended up paying for a plate I didn t ask for and for a bowl of soup I didn t eat cause it was disgusting.. All In all please avoid this place at all costs.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,7,Honestly   I have never ever made a review because I simply don t let other people s opinions stop me from personally trying out the food at any restaurant that I think looks good. Well this is my first review and anybody who reads this review please please please take into consideration what am about to say   I am Latino my whole life I have loved seafood it s my favorite food to eat to be honest  I love tostadas I love cockteles and everything that involves seafood. But honestly I have never never  eaten a tostada thats extremely stale and the seafood tostada  was so warm that I had to ask the waitress  WHY IS THE TOSATADA SUPER WARM  she said it s because it s from the Parilla   I have never eaten a warm tostada it s like eating a taco cold   you never mix water with oil what makes you think that warm seafood tostadas is a thing.  Anyways the waitress asked me we can give you a tostada de ceviche fish  instead  I said yes please  I GET MY CHECK AND GUESS WHAT    THEY CHARGED ME FOR BOTH TOSTADAS AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT ONCE I TOLD HER THAT  WHY ARE THEY CHARGING ME FOR BOTH IF I DIDNT EVEN EAT HALF OF THE OTHER TOSTADA  THIS IS THE MOST CRAZY PART  she says    IF I DONT CHARGE YOU THEY ARE GOING TO CHARGE ME FOR IT  how about that man  honestly   anybody that reads this   DONT EVER EVER COME TO THIS PLACE   this is not over for this place I promise you that   someone has to put a stop to this and until actually somebody with power does they will continue serving bad food and taking advantage of the customers.   FOR THE OWNER WHEN HE READS THIS ALL I CAN SAY IS GOD WATCHES EVERYTHING WE DO AND I KNOW GOD WILL DO THE RIGHT THING IN REGARDS TO THIS PLACE  maybe not now but everything we do wrong we must pay at some time  I just hope by that time they actually make changes before it s too late.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,8,My first  and only  time here  I was seated at the back of the bar. It took 15 mins. before one of the staff handed me a menu  this was after I pressed the service button  too  and before that I was ignored by almost all of the wait staff. After a menu was finally put in my hands  I ordered the carne asada.   The meal itself came out speedily and looked appetizing enough  but as soon as I tasted a morsel of the flank steak itself  I d just realized I d tasted what might be the most bland carne asada in at least a 5 mile radius. Spare yourself the disappointment in the quality of the food here  and go elsewhere if you really need to scratch that Texmex itch.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,9,Good food  Authentic seafood  our server was attentive and friendly.  Not sure if it s because we were visiting from another state but felt like food was also cheap. totally recommend this place  caldo de pescado y camar n was delicious 
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,10,Service is bad and super slow. It s not a seafood place. It s a Mexican restaurant with a few seafood items. Their version of c ctel de camarones is tomato juice with a few small shrimp and a pinch of onions oh and maybe a leaf or 2 of cilantro. NO AVOCADO  And a when you request it  it s  extra  WTF
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,11,This place is the worst place i have ever ate mariscos the food is the worst not i mean i mean not recommend at all shrimp chewy and oysters were hot don t let me start with service was the worst and the price is over priced.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,12,So disgusting. The food was SUPER salty had Ugly color. I didn t eat anything after tasting it I still got charged  60 for my plate and my child s plate. I do not recommend this place at all. You will be VERY disappointed.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,13,To begin with   the table was kinda dirty so I had to clean it. Also the horchata water was bad. It had no flavor . The food was gross. My sister ordered enchiladas and they were DRY VERY DRY. Like it felt you was eating sand. My boyfriend s food at the very bottom tasted like dish soap. I ordered a filete empanizado and it was gross. It looked like it was cooked but when you took it apart it was slimy and smelled like it wasn t cooked and it tasted raw.The cup of water my boyfriend was drinking of had food on the rim. Please tell me if that s not gross. There was ALOT of flies in the restaurant. There was like 5 flies around our table and food. One of them got in my boyfriend s cup. But besides everything that was gross the rice was the only good thing they had. The service was good but the food was just gross. I wouldn t recommend it. It s expensive for gross food. You re better off eating at McDonald s.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,14,Changing orders to be vegetarian is nearly impossible. The salsa is borderline perfect though and the vibe of the place is dreamy in a dive sort of way. Stop here if your want something legit  leave your annoying friends at home when you do.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,15,This place was BAD first of all the door would not open it was old and broken. The glass on the door was broken and the food had air mine and my friends. If i could put no stars I would
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,16,Authentic mexican food  which is my absolute favorite.  They play spanish music pretty loud but i didnt mind that. Hell who doesnt love Julion Alvarez   I had a michelada with dos xx and enchiladas with green sauce and sour cream. I recommend it to everyone. Service was good too.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,17,First of all they say that the first chips and salsa are on the house because they are stale as F   . So I m assuming they get rid of the stale ones for free so they can charge for the good ones   Second of all  why was the waitress so angry to serve us  Because we are gay and eating fish  Lol.. As for the food I ordered two ceviche tostadas and they looked like ham tostadas lol my partner ordered the shrimp frozen food plate with the side of two butter shots lmao. This place sucks 
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,18,ah  very nice reply.  I liked your place and was very disappointed at my last visit.  I ll be sure to come back now as I like supporting neighborhood restaurants.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,19,Talk about bad service and on top of that stealing     So my friend and I went for in lunch  the food was delicious  at least they have that going for them . We didn t get drink refills so whatever.. we re ready to pay and I noticed a sign that says  instant 4  discount if paying by cash  so obviously I decided to pay with cash.. and asked for my 4  discount.. but then surprise.. the cashiers waitress says  oh we don t do that  but it s clearly written.. so then they say.. yeah we know  the owner knows but we don t do that.. oh but if you pay with a card they ll charge you 4  extra      Then our cash back was shorten because  they don t carry coins      Idk.. a little confused as to how is this good for the customers
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,20, 1 Authentic Mexican Food. Super spicy dishes are available. Try the Caldo Levanta Muertos aka Raising the dead soup. It will clear those sinuses   1 Prices. This place is pretty affordable. Cheaper than a brick of marijuana.   1 Decor. Youll feel like the boss of your own Tejano drug cartel.   1 Music. Tejano stuff. They even have drunken sombrero margarita karaoke night. Its really crazy fun.   1 There is an upside down beer bottle in my margarita  P
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,21,Was expecting some real authentic mariscos but this is just fried  unhealthy  leaves you feeling sick  kind of food. Bad service - unfriendly. Not cheap. Also  the menu said  13 for a dozen oysters and they charged us  20. When we pointed that out on the check they said  no   20  without apology or remorse. Sorely disappointing all around.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,22,Really poor service and last time I went to eat there there was a big roach they should call health services on them to do an inspection
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,23,Terrible     I have never had enchiladas made with Parmesan Cheese.  Yes that s right  their enchiladas were stuffed with Parmesan cheese when I was expecting and looked like queso fresco.  The menu didn t clarify and the manager just shrugged his shoulders.  Got a tostada with pulpo and shrimp as well.  It came out with no Shrimp and the pulpo appears to have been fried.   Gross.  Never again.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,24,Overpriced for sure  food mediocre at best  Order the steak torta  I needed a magnifying glass to find the meat  Seafood tostada was just o.k. Definitely not what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant 
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,25,Worst food ever  and to think that they would charge  5 for changing two cheese enchiladas to chicken is a big RIP OFF never going back there again    
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,26,Don t recommend. I did find a pearl in my oysters but if I had bitten down on that I might look like a hockey player. Food overpriced. Very cold inside and it s like 46 degrees outside air conditioner still blaring . Brrr. Waitress was very nice but no English spoken here. More later.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,27,if i could give it zero stars i would  the service is TERRIBLE. when we first came in there was no hostess  no one came up to attend us until after we walked up to them. the waiters had a terrible attitude and it s like you re invisible. not to mention the hygiene in this place it looks like it hasn t been cleaned in years. overpriced for what it is. would not recommend.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,28,So I m in town for work and my wife booked my hotel and at first I was thinking she s trying to get me killed. Because the place looks sketchy as all hell but anyways if it wasn t for that I would have never found this place it s located right next to the hotel I m glad my wife s trying to get me killed because this Mexican place is what i want for my last meal the food was excellent service was fast and friendly only reason I took a star off cause I m the dork that tried to order a margarita at a Mexican restaurant   they only serve beer here  will defiantly come back if I don t get iced first
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,29,2nd time here and I got served literally 7 fries on my plate. A 14 dollar plate and 7 fries right.. I asked for more fries to my waitress and showed her my plate  she charged me 2  for MORE fries. Nice place and good food but please make sure you get what you pay for and ask before you or
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,30,I ll admit I do expect a lot when I am going out to eat. If you are anything like me you will not enjoy coming here at all    The outside of the restaurant is filled with handwritten spray paint which already showed some tackiness. I didn t mind it too much  since it s a Mexican restaurant. When I went inside  the inside smelt like a toilet  in Texas weather it was very hot outside  however the restaurant was hotter and humid  with no ac other than a few dusty fans. Waiting signs were hand written with sharpies on cheap ripped up pieces of paper.  We were a family of four  and were welcomed with the waitresses backs  they kept us waiting for a while before my mom finally gave them some advice on their customer service. They finally brought us to our table  and the waitress was very unprofessional. She rolled her eyes  and gave us no more than one menu... when we ordered she snatched the menu  when I wanted to refer back to a photo she refused to give back the menu. The corners of the entire restaurant were covered in dirt  and their kitchen was disorganized and unsanitary. I canceled my order after just looking around. I am very respectful  and sweet. Even though I am hispanic  I did not enjoy this  authentic Mexican food    The restrooms were disgusting  And the food was overpriced. It was also filled with creepy older men who continued to stare at me and my younger sisters    Do not come here. If I could rate zero stars I would.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,31,This place has the best Tacos in Austin   Get the Barbacoa.. They are amazing   Also fast service and great salsa.. loved the Nachos..
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,32,Ordered a shrimp cocktail here  and i must say its really good and full of shrimp  The salsa was delicious  The waitress was really friendly and very attractive  Will definitely eat here again 
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,33,This place is definitely nothing fancy  but the food was good. I had the Tex Mex plate  taco  enchilada  tamale  rice  amp  beans  and it was delicious. They had good salsa as well. It was quiet when I got there but mariachis came in during lunch which livened things up. Staff was good  but not overly friendly. I d go back - I have no complaints about the food.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,34,Service was bad. Food was not fresh. The fish crumbled upon my fork touching it and it just didn t taste right. Felt like the meat was in the freezer for awhile now.  Although it gets a two star cuz their gorditas was not as bad. Very authentic mexican place around austin. Also i think it s just the seafood that sucks.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,35,Do not come here unless you want absolutely horrible service. Every time we asked for a traditional seafood plate  they would say it wasn t on the menu. The servers would take very long to attend  considering there was very few people. The A C is non-functional  and it s summer  The food either came undercooked or very tasteless. Choose another place to eat seafood  unless you don t care for horrible table service  cleanliness  and undercooked food.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,36,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE Seriously..... stopped in here to grab some breakfast tacos.  While I was waiting for my food  someone dropped off a big bag of breakfast tacos from a different restaurant and the staff proceeded to eat the breakfast tacos in front of me. One of the girls even said  These aren t even good  I could have gotten these here  Then after 15 minutes of waiting I got my food and it was horrible. Absolutely no flavor  at all and it did not taste fresh in the least bit. The hashbrowns were disgustingly greasy. I bit into the party and so much grease dripped all over my pants. NEVER AGAIN    I ve never left a review on this but I just had to after my horrible experience.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,37,I had a great meal at this place  but I could see where if you misordered  you could leave disappointed  as many others have . If you really study the menu  this place excels in Mexican seafood stews. I know having a boiling hot stew in the Texan summer may not be enticing  but I had the  Levanta Muertos    raise the dead   and it was a winner. It was basically like a Mexican hot pot  fish  squid  octopus  crab      scallops  maybe   and shrimp in a super spicy stew that is made even spicier by the addition of tree chilis  raw jalapenos  and one other kind of chili. The chilis come on a side plate  similar to pho  so you can make it as spicy as you like. I went all in and was drenched in sweat to where even the wait staff was laughing at me. The stuff my friends got did not look nearly as good. The tortillas were sub-par  though I did like their super spicy salsa. If you like seafood and spicy food  as well as soups and stews  give this place a try. If you want fat-kid Tex-Mex  enchiladas  queso  fajitas  crispy tacos  etc.   go elsewhere. The atmosphere is straight out of Mexico  and we were the only white people there  which is a good thing in my opinion  as clearly people in the know like this place .
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,38,Was so disappointed that the sign said happy hour and all they have is beer. If you like beer then I guess its good  but I expected  margaritas.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,39,This was my first time here. The staff was friendly and food was made fresh and fast. I ordered the Pescado al gusto and it was fantastic. I will be returning here again.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,40,This has been the worst seafood I have ever tasted. I had some octopus tostada and it had no taste. I also had some enchiladas  were supposed to have queso fresco but instead were made with Parmesan cheese..... awful food. I don t recommend this place    
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,41,The food is really good. However  the service is the worst I ve had in town. They always get my order wrong  guaranteed  when I order to-go. Today  apparently they ve decided it s OK to hang up on me when I call to ask for a to-go order. I won t be giving them my business ever again. There are too many good places for tex-mex without dealing with their extremely low-class service staff.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,42,The customer service was a joke the wait time was a ridiculous. The food was disgusting. Although it being a reasonable price  it s not worth the price they put. No ac si definitely makes it that much worse   The tables were dirty. The place wsd a disaster. The experience here was overall a huggggeee disappointment.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,43,The seafood was terrible and the shrimp tasted like it was past expiration date. The sauce tasted sour and I could not keep it in my mouth for more than two seconds. A guy came in and played guitar and sang  he had a horrible voice  his music was so loud I could not hear myself think  and got mad at me when I did not give him any money. I never want to come back here again.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,44,We walk in and there were 4 T.V.s blaring. The setup was awkward to say the least. We sat down and ordered 2 Micheladas and it took a solid 5 minutes to get that order straight to our 16 year old waitress. It s not that there was a language barrier  bacause she spoke English...she had to repeat the beer poriton of the order several times just to get it correct  pobrecita . After the hassle we finally receive the bland Micheladas.  So now for the food.... Worst ceviche ever...it was sitting so long in the lime it became milky and unedible. Thinking of it now sends shivers down my spine.  The shrimp in the shrimp cocktail was itty bitty and not a very good grade...makes no damn sense...if you are going to have seafood in your name better make sure it s edible. Be warned and save yourself.  One good thing.... Their chips and salsa rock.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,45,This place is  eh.  I would put it on par with taquerias arandinas-and I do not like that place. I ordered a shrimp cocktail and it was mediocre and it was not even served chilled. It was room temperature. Yuck 
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,46,Off the hook good  closest to authentic I ve had since San Diego.  If you want the real stuff come here.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,47,The food was good  but the service was extremely bad. The waitress never came back with my water. It took 15 minutes for the check to arrive after I reminded them 3 times.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,48,Came for the first time and there was only 3 tables when we came in. We didn t even get a hello how are you  just straight up what can I get you to drink. The servers got upset when we needed something  the crab was dry. The server was too busy chatting in the bar and even got mad when we needed something. Will never come back here again. Worst service ever.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,49,The soups at this place are so good  they make everybody else look bad. I have tried three of them now  all with seafood  crab shrimp catfish  etc. . If you love soup  like I do   this place is a must. They can get very spicy.  Telenovelas are always blaring on at least one of the tv s. Great micheladas. Parking can be a bit of a pain in front  but just go to the overflow parking around back.. or park at the motel next door. I saw all sorts of questionable activities going on there as I was walking up today  and everybody still smiled at me. If anything  that adds to the experience. After all  we are still on east Oltorf  and some places this close to downtown are actually still real.  Seriously.. Try the soups here.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,50,gave a second and last chance to this restaurant  but just as the first time we didn t like it  we got our food wrong on both times  plates are over priced for the food they serve. not happy  and hopping we had a good Mexican style sea food place in Austin   
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,51,I m sorry to leave a bad review  but I hope this is gonna help the owner about the food  we ordered our food  and honestly this is nothing close to Mexican mariscos  or Mexican food  we came in there was a guy posing as a dj  for the karaoke  music was loud and really annoying  we asked to lowered the music down and they didn t like it  i ordered the cocktail  shrimp  and it was horrible   wasn t fresh and it looked like the frozen one  my caldo was just greasy and the imitation crab was just horrible  some pieces of fish bones with no meat  prices are high for the quality of food you get  I honestly came back home and was with upset stomach and was sick all night  I thought I was gonna get food poisoning  but thank god no  the restaurant was busy  and I guess since you guys are popular take care of the food preparation and keep the restaurant and restrooms clean  but the most important thing is the quality and preparation of the food hope the owner does something about it.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,52,TERRIBLE SERVICE.  And for being an authentic Mexican place  their flour tortillas are not good.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,53,We randomly stumbled onto this place while trying to grab dinner on the fly. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there and service was reasonable. Food was served promptly. I had the seafood soup with catfish. They were really generous with the serving and ingredients even though the seafood didn t taste very fresh. All in all it wasn t great but it didn t stink as bad as what the other reviews said.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,54,Really good shrimp soup. They have some proper mexican seafood dishes  but some of their beef platters are sort of tex mex. They have a bunch of combo plates with  funny names but the place has a nice mexican ambience. It s definitely worth checking out.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,55,First time there and not going back. I ordered a milanesa de pollo. I hate eggs and the milanesa tasted and looked like a  torta de huevo  I told them it tasted too much like egg and that I didn t like it after my first bite and the waiter just said..Awww and left. I also asked about the corn tortillas  so that I could at least eat the milanesa with a bunch of rice and beans so it wouldn t taste so much like egg and he said..oh milanesa plate doesn t come with tortillas and again he left. He didn t even offer to get me some. Needless to say I paid  9 for some good rice and beans.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,56,This place is fantastic. I m not sure why the negative reviews are so scathing. Disclaimer  This is authentic Mexican food  you ll probably be the only person there that uses Yelp. The service is great  If you ask to sit away from the music where it s quiet don t be surprised if it takes longer to get service. Great food  great service  good prices.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,57,If I could give 0 stars I would. This place is a waste of time and money. Food is horrible and over priced. Service is  wait what service  No service. Had to ask multiple times for avocado and still didn t get it  along with attitude from waitress.  Just save yourself and don t go there.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,58,This place has great Mexican food. Their Mexican seafood is out of this world good. Everything is made fresh and the service is great. You ll pay a bit more here than the competition  but it s worth it. Great spot here..
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,59,The only reason I gave it a one star is because there wasn t anything lesser. I was looking for some good food and it was convenient to go there. Everything looked good on the menu. But then it began. Our waitress took forever to wait on us and when she did she seemed annoyed. Finally got our drinks which sucked. A group of people sat down across from us at that time. She finally came and got our order. We waited for about 20 minutes before she even came and asked  if we wanted refills. Which is about the time the table across from us got their order. They were about finished when one of us got some of his order. I sat there for 10 more minutes and she finally brought me a taco. A cold damn taco at that. Sent that shit back. Then she brought the rest of his order. Then my bowl of soup came out. It was mostly water. 2 big bones and no meat. And luke warm. Then tried overcharging us on the drinks. Ive had some shitty food but that place and service topped it all. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT THERE.
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,60,the service was AWFUL   the food was horrid    a co-worker and I went during lunch there was nobody there and our food still took more than 30 mins. to come out   and we were late going back to work     NO BUENO    NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN   
La Catedral Del Marisco #2,61,over priced for what you get will never eat there again paid for 2 large cocktail of shrimp and 2 teas paid over 40.00 a mcdonalds fish sandwich would of been way better
Taco Bell,1,Cheap  delicious  spicy  and filling   Yay   As of this writing  they still sell their fiesta potatoes tacos for  1.00.  What an accomplishment in this day of inflation   I was thus able to buy 5 and still have a cheap and filling meal for about the same price as some grocery store meals.   I love their kiosk that lets you customize your orders.  I imagine customizing is a hassle for the staff  but they still often get it right.    Very nice and clean inside.   Yum for Yum Brands.
Taco Bell,2,The guy who took my order was nice but the food was trash. The potatoes were hard and cold like that s being lazy not to make new ones and the chicken quesadilla was not even worth it. Where was the chicken 
Taco Bell,3,Showed up an hour before they closed. As we were at the drive through they turned off the lights AN HOUR BEFORE CLOSING.  the end.  Will never show up here again.
Taco Bell,4,Seems like the workers here don t like to work and take advantage of their hours because everytime I pull up during what s supposed to operating hours they re literally always closed but their is ALWAYS employees inside.
Taco Bell,5,Great customer service by the guy working the drive thru speaker.  Drive thru was quick.
Taco Bell,6,This place is seems to be closed on operating hours more than normal. You see the employees in there  too  The times we ve been able to order  the order is wrong. Do yourself a favor and drive to the Taco Bell that s close to Pete Terrys. That place is awesome.
Taco Bell,7,RUDEST employee in the drive thru.  No sauce. No  thank you . Pulled up  what you want  is how we were greeted. Horrible   Employee had extremely long red nails. Does not need to be in customer service 
Taco Bell,8,I recommend going above and contacting the company. This is the worst taco bell in austin and I can vouch for that.  I live close by and 9 out 10 there are closed early  non responsive  rude and careless and go against store hours and never pick up the phone if you have an issue.   They bring back the Mexican pizza and advertise other goods but close down to renovation   idiots. But when you look online its open.  Night staff is trash.  It won t change till people bring attention to someone higher up.
Taco Bell,9,I wouldn t even give this place one star  The service is terrible. The drive-through workers are so rude they ve messed up my order they do not add napkins or condiments even after I ve asked. This last time I asked for hot sauce and napkins  cashier hands me my bag I look in it no napkins no hot sauce. I asked for hot sauce and napkins and I got the eye roll then one napkin and two sauces for the two burritos and six tacos.
Taco Bell,10,This place always has something going on  either there system is down. Or they can t do delivery orders. The employees are extremely rude and lazy. They ll take every opportunity to not work. I don t recommend this place to anybody  you ll be in for a rude awakening. They need to restaff cause it s obvious the people currently work there don t give one damn.
Taco Bell,11,I never write reviews but here we are. Every Taco Bell in the area says they re open until 1am  yet they re always closed if I go after 9 30pm. This location had their drive thru and parking lot blocked off with dumpsters at 9 45pm. Every time I go something is wrong with the order  the drink isn t filled up all the way. Last time the girl in the drive thru at 4pm said  it s been a long day    after having to remind her of my drink. Girl you work at Taco Bell  how rough can it be  Probably would be easier if your nails weren t 3 inches long.
Taco Bell,12,Not sure why it says temporarily closed on here  but it is is open and one of the best Taco Bell locations in Austin  Staff is always giving excellent customer service and makes you feel like part of the family. Speedy and excellent service  food is always good 
Taco Bell,13,Why is it closed during business hours when workers are sitting right there  It s happened on multiple occasions
Taco Bell,14,Went through drive thru  nice people but I asked for a chicken quesadilla and they gave me a cheese quesadilla  I went back and they made it right and added a LOT of chicken.   
Taco Bell,15,They NEVER have Cinnabon delights....EVER  I ve vistes on 4 different occasion and no luck. Very irritating lol
Taco Bell,16,A year and a half later...Taco Bell and this location have decided they don t care about their customers and never responded to my multiple attempts at customer feedback. I never wanted anything for free  I don t need your attention or your apologies...I do  however  deserve my money back for chalupas that were never given to me. To not even respond to negative feedback is an atrocious business move by both the managers of this location and corporate. Keep letting children run your place into the ground. Clearly you don t give AF. Don t spend money here.
Taco Bell,17,Every time I go to Taco Bell they say the computers are down even though the store has employees there.  I asked for the managers phone number and when I called all It did was ring no voicemail available.  today they were actually serving customers  for once and all the fryers were out  imagine that. This is the absolute worst Taco Bell I ve ever been to.
Taco Bell,18,Every single day I come here to see if they are open past 8pm and EVERY SINGLE DAY. They are closed and the staff just sitting inside  what is going on at this location   
Taco Bell,19,At this point I ve lost count of the number of times I ve shown up at this location and they ve been closed or having some other issue where they can t get food. I know the bar is low to begin with at Taco Bell s but this crew is a special type of incompetent.
Taco Bell,20,Ordered through Uber Eats and after an hour wait on a 34 minute delivery it was cancelled.  Went to McDonald s instead and actually got my food  and when it was supposed to be delivered.
Taco Bell,21,Arrived at 8pm and was told they re not taking orders despite the website saying they re open for another 6 hours.  No explanation whatsoever of what the problem is.  Not the first time having this kind of problem at this location.
Taco Bell,22,Horrible. Never open. Stupid guy says the system is always down. Literally worst service lazy ass people.
Taco Bell,23,I have worked fast food and I understand it can be frustrating when your system is down. I used to go here often because it s nearby somewhere I frequent. I love Taco Bell and go all the time near my house. I will not be returning to this location. I went because I hadn t eaten all day  I get up and they inform me they are only taking cash. As someone who was a broke college student  I ve saved up a lot of coins to pay for fast food so I don t need to worry about going out sometimes. I let them know that would be ok. Then everything I tried to order they were out of  and I understand they could ve just been frustrated because they had to take cash and they were out of stuff  they could ve been a lot nicer and apologetic. And the person who was taking my order switched twice  2 different people  but that was just kind of confusing lol. When I worked fast food I quickly realized you need to be very nice and apologetic or people will get angry. I wasn t really  I just ordered what I could  I have limited options as I am vegetarian.  when I came up to the window  I let him know I was paying with coins. Despite this  he only reached out one hand. I figured he thought he could hold it and I trusted it and handed it to him and he dropped my coins all over the floor. I tried to be nice and not say anything and just pick them up and his annoyance was evident. I know a lot of people who can only pay with coins  we are not trying to inconvenience fast food workers  it s all we have. As a fast food worker  you HAVE to be more understanding about that. Please. It s very rude to get annoyed at people for paying with what they have. Plus they were only accepting cash anyway. I still told him to have a good day because I understand that it s frustrating and embarrassing when that happens. But I hope y all get better customer service and be a lot more apologetic  even if you don t want to  it avoids situations like this where I left saying I d never return. When I got home  my potatoes were hard as a rock and barely edible. I will not be returning to this Taco Bell I d rather drive further to avoid it.
Taco Bell,24,Thank you kindly to Courtny at the Braker store in Austin Texas. What a kind  considerate  emphatic leader for this store. The wrong order was mistakenly given to me but with the management and communication he exuded  my satisfaction was met. Please note his effort and support  Appreciate you all for continuing to work for all of us...
Taco Bell,25,Freaking incompetent people   They act like they are doing you a favor abs your food is free  Maybe if the person taking the order wouldn t be in their phone they get the order right   Maybe they would include a straw for your drink and the hot sauce you asked for   But no instead I m eating dry AF tacos no sauce and drinking my soda out of the cup with no straw   If you are so freaking unhappy with your job quit abs get another one   Freaking ridiculous   it s almost all the Taco Bell s too here in Texas    Not to mention I have to drive 10 minutes out further CS use the one by my house is even worse  
Taco Bell,26,I don t know what the hell happened with this taco bell. They used to be pretty awesome and rarely ever screwed up my order. Now I feel like they re hardly ever open- twice I have driven by before 11pm and they are either fully closed down or there is a dining chair in the drive thru lane blocking it. Twice now I have ordered food with the app and they don t have all the menu items available  which is annoying  but also made the items wrong. Today I went through the drive thru and the guy taking my order was in such a hurry he didn t get several things right that I even asked about before he gave me the total. Had to clarify with the people at the window that the items were incorrectly entered in  then wait another 5 mins for them to remake the food    I get home and I guess they don t make mild sauce anymore   Because for the 3rd time now I ve gotten a box full of hot sauce. I open up the taco supremes and begin to think they ve run out of tomatoes too. 3 taco supremes with everything but the tomatoes on them. These are really simple things I can live without and still eat my food  but it adds up to me never coming back because they cant get shit right.
Taco Bell,27,Like any tacobell this place is better during the day time and not at night. I ve Been here several times and they ve forgotten a few items over the time and have made some item poorly. That being said they are consistent with giving you lots of sauce which is awesome  
Taco Bell,28,I came to get some food through the drive thru  Marcus took my order and made me smile and laugh with him. Such an awesome personality and upbeat nature about him  Let there feeling good and happy 
Taco Bell,29,I usually avoid Taco Bell because of the grade H meat  and staffs inability to fulfill simple orders  but was feeling lazy and stoned on my day off and still don t have running water to cook with. Lady taking the order on the com was really nice  but when I went to pay the jackass child who took my money was making fun and laughing at me with a co worker. Not that I give a shit  I think it was because I was ironically wearing a  DARE  shirt I bought at a thrift store lol- but more likely because he just hated white people.. could hear him code switching between me and whoever else was laughing at me back there. Again whatever man  they seemed butt hurt jealous  and I m happy to make people laugh  just wanted to feast on my tacos- but sure enough he handed me a wadded up bag with all the tacos clearly crushed to pieces intentionally. I did nothing to piss anyone off  I was super nice and quiet. Should have went and dumped them on the dudes car  but I m sure he just grew up without a father and only knows how to behave like a little girl. I threw them out because god knows what else they re doing back there. At least I didn t feel like throwing up the rest of the day.
Taco Bell,30,Honestly the people here do whatever they want  the order is always wrong  the staff is disgusting  and they legit don t know how to make the food. Save the time and go to another location.
Taco Bell,31,I had a metal skrew in my breakfast burrito. It was not pleasant when I bit down on it. Hopefully it was not intentional by the cooks.
Taco Bell,32,EVERY TIME I order food at this location  my orde is wrong.  I had won a gift card which is why I gave them a  chance again and was more disappointed this time than every other time.  Don t bother ordering a supreme anything  you won t get it.  You will also leave the drive through missing items. There are better fast food places close by to frequent.  Do yourself a favor and don t go to this location. Pathetic.
Taco Bell,33,Took my wife to Taco Bell for a quick lunch break  and it s about what I expected  fast food 
Taco Bell,34,Ate beef because of wrong marker on the package. Disgusting   .. I am pure vegetarian and I can t explain how disgusted I feel due to your small mistake. Please have your staff be cognizant about such things and their impact.  First P-Terry and now you guys. Bad week for me.
Taco Bell,35,This place has to be trying to go out of business. Don t go to this location  having a perfect experience there is harder than winning the lottery.
Taco Bell,36,Lunch on a Saturday  Forget it    Staff was overwhelmed... management did an abysmal job of making sure enough people showed up happy and ready to work. The drive-through wasn t moving and the inside of the store wasn t either.  For a fast food restaurant  this wasn t fast --not even a little bit. I seriously worry about this store. If it was a ship at sea  I d ask the owner how he she feels about keelhauling.
Taco Bell,37,Drive thru on braker has a knucklehead taking orders and we have been in the drive thru for 29 mins - avoid if customer service and your time is important.   food was ok - but after that wait  who cares - not a happy customer
Taco Bell,38,Perfectly nice Taco Bell. The Quesalupa was flavorless and stupid.  My meal was provided to me before I walked the 20 feet to the soda machine  but it was around lunchtime so I guess they have them ready to go.  They were  out of large-cup lids  so I could have an extra large soda for no charge. Or a medium. I chose extra large ...  The dining area is immaculate and with some high tables that might be fun for groups. But there s lots of signs outside about loitering.
Taco Bell,39,My dearest Taco Bell Corporate   I have neglected you lately but not dispassionately. I have only been thinking inside the bun lately  too much Americana on the mind at a time when isolationism seems more pleasant than the alternative. And fourthmeal  As forgotten as the naivete of our youth. What I can say is that it is always an experience when our post-divorce paths cross in the distant badlands  the nexus of drinking about you and not being able to find any other eateries open as late that enthuse me even a little bit  like a gas station burrito  I would always return to you over that option.  At the juncture of our latest fond encounter I was taken aback. This was the first time  across the wide and disparate lands  that the guy taking the order through the squawk box asked me if I wanted to donate to charity. At no other Taco Bell has this happened. I did not know if this is a new Taco Bell thing  or just that one. I find it mildly humorous that like many people  I was in the drive thru late in the evening because it was cheap  as in I did not have a lot of money but I could still eat like the King of the Peasants awash in my wealth of cheaply priced tacos. That demographic of your drive thrus  especially in the late evening  I would not think is going to be among the big contributors to that enterprise. Shaking down an investment banker or oil  amp  gas person  that is a different story. They are assholes  excepting Warren Hellman  but they have the money to fix all the root causes of feigned evil and evil-in-fact. But your typical Taco Bell customer  No. We re not seeking authentic Mexican cuisine  we are broke and need cheap tacos. So I will be interested to see if this was an isolated incident  or if this is a new chain thing you are rolling out across the board  like fourthmeal or think outside the bun.   P.S. Bring back the chihuahua so I can pet him.
Taco Bell,40,Warning - their closing time does not match what s on their website or yelp.  Drive here and you risk wasting a lot of gas.
Taco Bell,41,Did I just admit to liking Taco Bell  Did I visit a clean location with friendly employees who filled my order correctly    Nah  I must be sleep-posting on Yelp.  And sleep would explain how that cheesy potato burrito thing could become my fast food vice.
Taco Bell,42,Very pleased-wanted breakfast tacos for the office on short notice  called in my order and it was just about ready when I arrived 20 min later.  Very nice crew.
Taco Bell,43,3 times I ve been here since moving into the area. 3 times I ve ordered a number 2 with a soft taco and no ice in my drink. 3 times I ve gotten a crunchy taco with ice. They re 0 for 3 on getting my order right.
Taco Bell,44,Orders are always wrong  chips are stale  and the food is made like no one cares. Taco Bell on Parmer Ln is MUCH better.
Taco Bell,45,Went there today for lunch before heading back home to Houston. Went with a co-worker and it turned out he ordered the same thing I did. Ten minutes later they called out his order and I was curious on why his order was called before mine even though we ordered the same thing. Two more orders were called out so I asked a staff member about my order. He looked it up on his monitor and said that it would be right out. Well  four more orders were called and I was still waiting. My co-worker already finished his meal. I asked for a manager because I ve already waited 20 minutes and wanted a refund. The same guy that told me that my order was coming right up  approached the register to give me a refund. He avoided eye contact as he went through process and even when he handed me the money. I didn t even receive an apology or explanation for what had happened. Lunch ruined.
Taco Bell,46,I literally just left this establishment. As I ordered my food  I saw a lady walking with a broom in her hands  as soon as my order loads onto the screen  the same lady holding the broom  went to make my food. She did not change out her gloves. I addressed her and the situation. I approached the situation calm and civil. I had asked if she changed her gloves before making my food because I saw her holding the broom. She said no and looked offended that I even had to ask. She got so bothered that an elder lady that worked there had to tell her to calm down. I don t understand  if I was on the other side  would she have liked for me to make her food when my hands were in possession of a dirty broom     Really people....this is the food industry....why the attitude  Anger  You definitely won t see me here anymore  
Taco Bell,47,You d think as the cost of fast food have raised over there years that there quality of the food would also get better but they skimp on the amount of chicken they put into the tacos I get the chalupas and there s never enough chicken in them it s disappointing really would it hurt to add a little more meat 
Taco Bell,48,Avoid like the plague  Way too long in the drive thru. Almost ten minutes from order to pick up with one car in front of me. Ordered a grilled and nachos bel grande. Burrito was unevenly made so half of it was just tortilla. Nachos were made up of all broken chips except like two. Just NO.
Taco Bell,49,not a good taco bell. writing more cuz yelp won t let me post blah blah blah lol yeet
Taco Bell,50,I love me some Taco Bell.  Whenever my son gets to pick dinner most times he picks Taco Bell.  Even though my wife and son incorrectly order their bean burritos with no onions and without red sauce and I get them they were God designed them to be eaten  Taco Bell always gets both orders correct.  Throw in some cheesy roll ups  which let s be honest is just a tortilla with some melted cheese with a fancy name to trick kids in to getting it  some soft tacos and you can feed a fmily of 3 for around  10.  Victory   This Taco Bell always seems to crush its health department scores as well.  winning
Taco Bell,51,I drove all the way to this place at 1AM because it said it was open until 1 30AM only to arrive at 1 10AM and receive no service. Nobody even came to the window to talk to me  they just looked at me  talked amongst themselves and ignored me. This is not cool. Don t say you close at 1 30AM and then refuse to acknowledge people before this time. Extremely uncool.
Taco Bell,52,I love this Taco Bell. They always get my picky orders correct and everything is always hot  probably because I order so much stuff without certain ingredients so they re probably not able to give me the pre made stuff  but either way  love this Taco Bell. Think I m gonna run up there now actually.
Taco Bell,53,Taco Bell generally gets a bum rap  but I don t understand what people s expectations are when they judge TB so harshly.  I was a little annoyed that they didn t have a combo meal available for the new item they are promoting  the fajita melts  stay away from those btw.  The new 79 cent Cheesy Roll-Ups RULE   The thing that sets this location apart is that they have greeters during lunch  this would be annoying  but they seem to be so genuinely nice that it is okay if they ask you how you are doing and how the food is 2 or 3 times.
Taco Bell,54,Been going there since I move back to Austin I ve gotten to know all the nite crew there always smiling laughing very friendly they go out of there way to make my meal just the way I like it thank you nite crew y all are the best keep up the great service ...
Taco Bell,55,Food and service were very good. My reason for 2 stars and not higher is the TV.  I m not a fan of news being shown when you are out trying to relax and CNN is the absolute worse.  I d prefer almost anything else. People get enough news  how about something more enjoyable.
Taco Bell,56,Okay  I ll admit it. Taco Bell  also affectionately referred to as Toxic Hell  is a guilty pleasure of mine... and not always when I ve been drinking  surprisingly. I was a little more than devastated to see that this location had closed upon a recent craving. I even Tweeted about its demise. So  imagine how excited I was to discover that they d only been closed for remodeling. Hooray   I ve never actually been inside  but my drive thru experiences have been great. The employees are usually pretty friendly  I was in my work clothes the last time and I was asked if I was going to work or on my way home. I always order the same thing with a slight modification and I ve never been given any flack for getting a soft taco in lieu of the crispy. Well  it s Taco Bell  so I really don t know what to say about the food... except that its really tasty when you re hungover  depressed  stressed out  overwhelmed  or just hungry. Yeah  pretty much any time.  My affinity for Taco Bell probably stems from a couple childhood experiences  and I m totally okay with that.
Taco Bell,57,I may be intoxicated as I write this  but that should show how sincere I am in my review. The drive thru operator was so kind and accommodating. He didn t make us feel at all rushed or an inconvenience  will definitely be back for future drunk purchases.
Taco Bell,58,I just stopped in to this Taco Bell and was greeted with rudeness. Initially they stated that they were out of beef so I was told whatever I wanted to order had to be changed to chicken or steak. Once I got to the window I asked why we were charged for an issue that we had no control over. He stated that even though they didn t have beef he still had to charge me for the unwarranted change. He then proceeded to be rude and say that if I didn t like it I could get something else. I was taken aback because I wasn t rude with him  I simply asked a question. He also stated that they closed at 1 30 and there was no point in making more beef when they were about to close. I understand that logic  because it was almost 1 am  but they initially lied stating they were  out  of beef or didn t have any  not that they didn t want to make it. He was beyond unprofessional and argumentative. We were charged an additional  4 for an issue that was out of our control. I find that extremely unacceptable. Working late  being pregnant and just wanting to grab something quick to eat turned into a very unpleasant experience.
Taco Bell,59,Came during  happy hour  where they have dollar medium drinks  wanted water and they had to charge me a full dollar for a medium cup  seriously  I mean I get a like 20 cent charge for the cup but full price for a water  That s ridiculous.
Taco Bell,60,I ve always loved Taco Bell but unfortunately my local one  Braker and Research  always and I mean ALWAYS messes up my order.  Today was one of the worst.   My order  Cheese Quesadilla no sauce Nacho Bell Grande no sour cream Large Pepsi Mild sauce  What I got  Chicken Quesadilla Nachos with no beef    Medium Pepsi Fire Sauce  0 4 that s a new low    The employees are nice but I think I ll have to stop going here.
Taco Bell,61,placed an online order and prepaid. when i get home i have missung items. i called to ask for the missing items to be refunded as i dont want to drive back in pouring rain. the employee who answered made no apology but simply i will have to contact the GM tomorrow they couldnt do that. an apology and at least asking for contact info for the gm to contact me would have been nice. i did get nachos that were stale and the lid was not on and fell all over the bag. Don t think i will be back here. pretty gross and now i need to track down a gm for their mistake.
Taco Bell,62,Probably the worst experience I have had at taco bell ever. My family and I went to the drive thru to order some lunch the day before easter. We asked for a minute to get our kids orders ready and the lady  valentine g  was very rude. She continued to say she couldn t hear my husband and told us to pull up the the first window  where james took the rest of our order. We pulled up to the second window and were asked if we wanted sauce. At this time I realized I ordered the food for my children and forgot about myself. We asked to add a taco and she was visibly more angry. She took the credit card from my husband and yelled into the cooks that she needed another taco. Then proceeded to throw bag after bag of food in our car window at my husband. When she gave him the drinks she put his card on top of one of the drinks and rudely just said  card  like we are supposed to know she wasn t going to just hand it to us and put it on top of our drink instead. After we received the last taco we ordered we started to leave the parking lot when I realized my children did not get their drinks. We went back and rather than dealing with her in the drive thru I decided to go inside and talk to the manager about the drinks and the customer service his staff was giving at the drive thru. He seemed complete unfazed by what I had to say. While getting the drinks for my children he had to remind his staff to get back to work and take orders at the drive thru. Also valentine decided to hide behind the kitchen equipment while her other coworkers came around the corner trying to see who was talking to their manager about their customer service. All the manager had to say at that point was have a good day and sorry for the inconvenience. None of it was sincere  it was like he didn t even care that his staff could be so rude and unprofessional. I understand this is fast food but if you don t like your job then maybe you shouldn t work in fast food or customer service. Then when we got home we realized the drinks were just carbination and our tacos were half wrapped and falling apart all over the bag. This was a waste of money and time.
Taco Bell,63,Worst drive through experience aver. Waited 33 minutes in the drive through to get to the window with only a few cars in front of me 12 2 16 1 00 pm. Get to the window girl gives me the wrong total and have to go back and give her more money. Waited another 4 minutes to get food while girl was standing there doing nothing dancing around and talking to another girl. Hard tacos were all cracked in half and other food was cold. Poor management at this location for sure.
Taco Bell,64,It would be great if the price on the board matched what they ring up.
Taco Bell,65,Lousy  slow service. Nobody cares about the customers. Go home if don t want do the job. Make room for other people that want to work.
Taco Bell,66,I love Taco Bell and this is the closest location to my house so I will keep going here but it is rare they get our orders right. More often than right it is wrong or missing something. People are extremely friendly though. Just check your bag before you leave.
Taco Bell,67,I m giving this a glowing review purely because of the incredibly nice and sincere people who work here  who deserve better than to work at a lousy underpaying fast food job. You can stand to pay your workers higher  Taco Bell corporate.
Taco Bell,68,I love Taco Bell  and this location has some great people. I give it 4 stars cause there is one constant problem  they always miss something. When I catch it and point it out they never hesitate to make it and give it to me on the house. But the employees are awesome and always make me feel welcome 
Taco Bell,69,I ll admit it  I like Taco Bell.  I ve never had a problem at this location. They are always friendly and the service is always fast.  Free WiFi and TV  its great to go on your lunch break when you don t have a lot of time or money.    Thank you Taco Bell.
Taco Bell,70,The day shift people have always been nice.  The manager that works nights is extremely rude  on multiple occasions.   She didn t give us the second half of our order and didn t say anything to us and walked away from the window and kitchen  get home realize half of our food is missing and she blamed it on us driving away.  Another time went they the drive thru and she refused to let us have two orders for one car  and we re stuck in the drive they so just had to do an order all together.  Never polite at the window.  I came here pretty often but this manager just makes me not want to come here.  BUT the day shift is great  Just don t go at nights
Taco Bell,71,I LOVE Taco Bell..however  I have never been so rudely treated in my life at a fast food place. These places are a convenience for the consumer  thats why its called fast food. The Manager  a crotchety old man  was working the drive through. Upon ordering  I ordered a  1. He asked if there was anything else and I replied with a yes and tried to carry on with my order. After everything I ordered  he said  do you want anything else    not can I get you anything else. I did have one more item that I wanted to order and I did. I ordered a Burrito Supreme. Well  the number one has a Burrito Supreme and he rudely said   another one    like I was some sort of pig or something. His demeanor was awful. This is the manager we are talking about here. This man need not be in customer service  he should be in an office or on the assembly line  firing . When I asked for a few more hot sauce packets  he practically threw them at me. But wait..it gets better. After all that  we pulled out of the drive thru  not checking the bag and ended up missing an item...seriously    So. I pulled back thru the drive thru  was met at the first window this time by a wonderfully nice man that not only had what was missing from our order ready  but at his own doing  threw in 2 empanadas for us. Very kind. We graciously asked him for a few more packets of hot sauce  my fiance drinks the stuff  and he so willingly asked what we wanted and accommodated. I will NEVER go back to that Taco Bell  not that there aren t 50 of them in Austin  but that particular one needs a new manager. I don t know how they keep employees if he treats customers like that..how does he treat his employees      My message to him...just because you are having a bad day  doesn t mean that your customers have to suffer the repurcussions of your unhappiness. You chose your job and you get to wake up every day and decide if its going to be a good day or a bad day. Note to self  pal..if its going to be a bad day..STAY HOME. We don t deserve to be treated that way.
Taco Bell,72,This is like a High End Taco Bell. Staff is great  food is great and the place is very clean.  I ve been here twice now  and I will return 
Taco Bell,73,This is hands down the nicest Taco Bell I ve ever been to  Great service and very clean. Also  the food was prepared well and wasn t sloppy and messy when I got it  10 10 would recommend.
Taco Bell,74,Good service. They put up with a lot of yuppie crap that slows the line. I go there twice a week  and am almost always trapped behind a Lincoln Navigator or Toyota Sienna with 15 item orders and multiple substitutions. I rub my forehead as they bark out  on that one  no tomato ... or  maybe just a little tiny bit of sauce on my burrito... like  a REAL TINY bit . YUCK. Die in a fire. Despite having to deal with these a-holes  the employees are always cheery and do their best to move the line as quickly as possible. A  for the store  overall. I usually get my nachos without tiny broken chips... and my tacos are always well-loaded and well-wrapped. Tortillas are always hot. Good job  Arboretum. A 
Taco Bell,75,We stopped by here one late afternoon for a quick snack. The male cashier looked young and inexperienced. That didn t matter. What mattered  however  was pretty much how the following events unfolded. The cashier charged us extra  and we didn t notice it until the receipt was already printed out. He brought it to the attention of his manager -- a Hispanic woman who looked like in her late 40s. She came out from the back of the kitchen and approached the counter with no smile on her face or even just a  Hi . The cashier explained to her the issue  and I did as well. She insisted the charge was correct. I told her it s not and pointed it out to her. It finally hit her that I was correct. But the attitude she showed was quite disturbing  like it s such a burden to make the necessary changes by punching a few buttons. Although it was just a two dollar extra charge  it wasn t about that. It was about integrity and customer service.  Later  I had to go back to the counter to ask for something in relation to our order. She didn t even want to make eye contact with me. How rude    I didn t get her name. Apparently  she took her name tag off. This incident took place on 4 13 2015 around 5PM. Don t get me wrong  I do like Taco Bell. It s just that the experience we had that time was very unsatisfactory.
Taco Bell,76,Soooo Slow.  Only 1 cashier at lunch  so the line extended to the door.  After waiting 8 minutes to place my order  I waited 18 minutes to get my food.  No  I am not exaggerating it really took that long.  There were 4 customers that asked for refunds  due to the wait.  The worst part is that nobody ever appologized.  The manager giving the refunds only made excuses that they were short staffed.  This is the second time in the past month that this has happened.
Taco Bell,77,A really friendly Taco Bell. It was really fast and the people were so nice. I must admit I would go back to them
Taco Bell,78,Without question the finest Mexican fare in the area.
Taco Bell,79,I seem to only eat taco bell after getting off of work at 11pm  i go through drive thru of couse and impressively......whoever runs the drive thru here is FRIENDLY  I m all grouchy after getting off of work and its so nice to hear a friendly person  Food is as usual  you get what you pay for and can never go wrong with the cheap nachos.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,1,Came in to order to go    The staff was very helpful and recommending dishes.   Ordered the 7 seas soup    The ambience is a bar feel. Not my personal fav Bc feel Bc to dark and dreary.   The soup is delicious and full of a large variety. Would def go back to try more food.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,2,Was exploring other possible Mariscos  Sea Food  location while traveling this part of Texas and thought this must be a hidden local venue  yes...it hidden and very unusual place to find.  From outside could discourage you as I was hesitant to enter  however the place is clean has great layout and character with two bars and excellent sound system lighting and TV screens everywhere  including  a stage for a band to perform. Sitting offering booths and tables depending of party size. Nice   Food quality and portion for the price was disappointing  other than the jumbo shrimp seems to be the favorite item to order while I was there.     14.95 appetizers   1 2 dozen of half shell Oysters  fair to ok  29.96 Main dish   price didn t match menu by a  1   Parrillada  Grilled Shrimp  Beef  Chicken  amp  ear nopales  with rice and beans and a small greens  the corn tortillas were hard and seem old and everything was just bland tasting.  Drinks  ask price before ordering    9.40 Modelo bottle beer    WOW   12oz.  11.33 for Modelo Super-Michelada 24oz  deal   Note  Regular menu had no pricing for beer or alcoholic drinks  my error not to ask   Service  was fair to good but continue to ask for condiments to improve the flavor of this items that took to long to get  considering the place was relatively empty.    Conclusion  did my best to enjoy the experience but left feeling disappointed. Furthermore  since this venue caters to local Latinos who learn quick when it comes to  cost  lesson learned should there be a next time   Hey the first one was on me    But  Ahh...above are my token to share this exploring experience to the next happy wonder   Bathroom are Decent and plenty of parking  Finally Regardless of where you go ask questions and be engaging to explain what they are offering.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,3,This food is horrible. It s all fake seafood  the meat is just cooked that s it no seasoning no taste  nothing. It takes about an hour for it to come out cold and have NO TASTE   Honestly I was so upset for the prices they are charging you would think it would be half decent.. If you wanna save yourself from  throwing up don t come here.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,4,Decided to give it a shot my brother order some food and food was trash he ordered a meatball stew meatballs were still frozen when they arrive at the table if I can give it a zero stars you know damn well I ll give a zero. The shrimp cocktail was good but the food is overpriced.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,5,Cobran por gratitud cuando aveces el servicio es pesimo  se supone que uno tiene que dejar lo que quiere.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,6,Worst place ever   If can give it zero stars I would. This food is disgusting and over priced. The food arrived cold. We still had to pay the full amount. The drinks tasted watered down also. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place    You re better off going to McDonald s.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,7,I wouldn t with my family to eat and I was eating but then I looked down at the floor and cockroaches started coming out
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,8,The food was good but I asked for a beer and it tasted awful  when I told the waitress she said the manager told her I still had to pay for it even if I only took a couple of sips  so beware if you do not like what they serve you you still have to pay for it even if its horrible and don t eat or drink it
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,9,I appreciate the service here and the chips were great. Their Baja taco really sucked tho and their shrimp enchiladas were probably the worst shrimp enchiladas I ve ever had. They just tasted kind of bad and a bit on the fishy side. I probably won t be back here but I did enjoy the ambiance of this restaurant.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,10,This place is really crapy  the lobster was fake worst than imitation crab  baked potatoe was hard as a rock  drinks suck  waittress terrible  manager was worst than anything  never going here again.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,11,I m on vacation and I try to treat myself after a day of cancelled plans  and the food is legitimately disgusting. Thanks a lot  Mariscos Tampico.    Like  seriously. Scallops were rubbery and watery and legitimately inedible. Crab cake was ice cold. Rice was way undercooked. Queso was hot and delicious  which is why I gave them one star  but even then  they only gave me like eight chips. I was really hoping for a good treat  but I ended up just... sullenly dipping microwaved cheese sticks in queso once the chips ran out. Thanks for increasing the disappointment of a disappointing day of disappointments.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,12,worst service ever. Dont order take out  they are rude  soup was spilled all over and didnt deiver the drinks. Nobody answer the phone.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,13,Went here on the recommendation of Jenmarie P.  who told me they have the best mol  enchiladas in town. And indeed  they re pretty darn tasty.   It s not terribly easy to find. Don t go into the flea market. That s just a glorious waste of time that will lead you far from enchiladas.   Service at the bar was slow  but friendly. I think all drinks  including sodas  get made there. The chips and salsa were tasty  but nothing terribly amazing.   The margaritas are good as well. Not much of the overly-sweet sour mix in there. Fair bit of Everclear  though  so watch yourself.   Mol  enchiladas don t have cheese on top here  a pet peeve of mine   but thankfully they put cheese inside. The chicken is just chopped up chicken breast. Is there no tinga at this place  The sauce is damn good  though. A bit of heat  good flavor  quite a bit of oil  and that unfortunately makes it slide right off of the tortillas while you re eating them. This is frustrating  and could be solved by topping them with cheese and putting them under the broiler  like any civilized enchilada would be made.   The kicker of this place  though  is the price point. It s high. It s a little too high.  8 per house margarita   11 for enchiladas   30 for lunch  That s a bit much. I might be back to try some of their seafood  which looks great  but only when I have a fair bit of excess money lying around.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,14,This place is Literally the worst seafood I ve ever tasted and I m a huge Mariscos eater. The micheladas also was the worst I ve ever had. Didn t even taste the beer or Clamato just the Warshire sauce  I don t ever do reviews even if I don t like the place but if I can save someone from trying this and wasting money on this garbage I will  It s also expensive to make things worse lmao 
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,15,If I could rate 0 stars I would. Service horrible  drinks horrible  didn t have items that were on the menu  no chips and salsa served. The food had no flavor. My rice and beans were cold. Would not recommend and will not be back.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,16,Food is trash. They don t know how to cook  I won t recommend this place at anyone. You re better if eating at Taco Bell than here.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,17,Had a nice dinner for my wife and i  The food was really good and The drinks were delicious and strong  The micheladas are muy bien  our waitress was super nice and sweet  had chicken and beef fajita ate half and took other half home    they are generous   
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,18,Always delicious  The mole sauce is the best I ve had in Austin anywhere and their shrimp salads are amazing.  We are regulars here and the margaritas  rocks  spicy salt  are strong and tasty  and everything else has been good too. Fresh made guacamole  enchiladas suiza  enchiladas mole  and seafood salad.  All fantastic. Killer tortas cubanas too   Good service and the karaoke doesn t suck.    
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,19,Had a nice dinner for my husband and i  The food was really good and The drinks were delicious and strong  The micheladas are mega great  our waitress was super nice and sweet  had chicken and beef fajita ate half and took other half home    they are generous   
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,20,Food is decent but not good enough for me to waste my time here. I ve been here 3 times total and ordered takeout once. The service is terrible. Servers are slow and inattentive. The one time I ordered takeout against my better judgement it took about 50 min for a very simple order of 4 tostadas de camaron seemed like they forgot to put the order in twice. I won t be coming here again.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,21,I ordered a mojarra. It came with rice  salad  mostly lettuce and a couple slices of tomato   fries  and tortillas. I requested to substitute the fries with extra salad. Waiter just shortly replied that they don t do that. I asked  what if I m wanting extra salad and no fries  He says  don t eat the fries and order a salad for an extra charge. I m sure that this ridiculous policy has nothing to do with the price of lettuce vs fries but more about making a profit no matter what. My dish looked good but looks can be deceiving  The fish was tasteless and super greasy. I only tasted the grease. Not good. I do not recommend this place at all. Less than one star for me.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,22,Please excuse my logos and typos   I give one star to This restaurant if I can call this a restaurant   I went for a family dinner on Saturday  around 7pm  With my Wife and I and my two daughters  not a busy time for them  We sat by the hosted after 6 minutes we get our chips and salsa. 5 minutes later a male server arrived to our table   Since my baby daughter don t eat seafood  we plan to get it kids meal for Her so my wife very nicely  ASKED THE SERVER  WIFE  ARE THE KIDS MEAL COMING WITH ANY DRINKS   SERVER   THIS IS NOT MCDONALDS   I STAND FROM THE TABLE and I told him excuse me  How you  can you respond to HER like that she is only asking one question for you   can you answer professionally. You are the server so you must answer questions in a good manner I told my FAMILY TO GET OUT THE TABLE. And leave He was so confused because of my reaction but I told the hosted the situation and she said sorry. And by the way  Food is overpriced. Drinks. Are overprice   Noise is too loud and a gross looking  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fplace.in amp s 17f22484e5094e49da0262eb84e24eba86d52637dba1bb14ece956c0bf8b222a  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  place.in  a  the inside For outside Look NICE AND CLEAN BUT THATS NOT A RESTAUTANT is the the big box were the flee market is located    Thanks
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,23,Worst place ever. Just went today 25 minutes later they bring chips and salsa. . Now its 35 minutes and we get drinks total of 55 to get our food and its all wrong bathrooms dirty . Spoke to management was worse then the server.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,24,I m disturbed to have read that previous customers used a Groupon.  I went in with a Groupon last week and was told it was a scam and that they d never set any deal up with Groupon.  I was very disappointed but decided to give them a try anyway.  I ordered and paid full price for  a grilled tilapia that  unfortunately  was so dry and bland I couldn t finish it.  It was honestly the worst tilapia I ve ever tasted  and their drinks were overpriced.  To be fair  I will say the salsa for the chips was great.  But my companion also thought her food mediocre for the price.  I really wish they would have compensated me in some way for the Groupon  the smallest gesture would have left me with a better impression.  But I ll never go back.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,25,Baby Octopus.  Pineapple.  Telenovelas projected on the wall 20 feet tall.  Weird little place  hard as hell to find  but very  very tasty mexican ish  seafood. Next to the flea market in Crockett Center.   12 bucks for a fajita skillet full of tilapia  shrimp  crawfish  octopus  pineapple  peppers  onions and about a pound of Monterey jack cheese.  Gringos beware  seafood lovers rejoice.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,26,I had heard good things about this place  so I decided to check it out... wish I d just stuck with my regular spots. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas.   I waited 20 minutes for my food. I ran out of chips and water  never to be refilled during this wait. When the food arrived  I asked for more water and got some  however our chip bowl was removed and never returned.   By the time our food finally arrived  mine was cold  the pound of cheese they put on it was already hard  the beans tasted like something out of a Wolf Brand Chili can and the rice was awful and not even fully cooked. I sent it back. Bummer. HOWEVER  my friend got the skillet of  tilapia  shrimp  crawfish  octopus  pineapple  peppers  onions and about a pound of Monterey jack cheese   and it was ok minus the store bought corn tortillas... but not enough so that I d ever go back.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,27,I m definitely not a Mexican food expert  but I have lived in cities coast to coast with large Mexican populations. Therefore I ve been eating Mexican food for a long time. With that being said  the food at Marisco Tampico was the worst Mexican food that I ve ever had. Actually  it was the worst food I ve ever had. I ordered the Mole Chicken Enchiladas and ceviche tostatdo. Both were literally un eatable. I would advise that you stay far away from this place. The only good points about this place was the Ice Water and the Saltine crackers.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,28,Food quality is overall a 3-4 star. I ve been there 3 times and once it was cold  the 2nd the rice was undercooked  and the 3rd was just fine.  The food portion is moderate and prices for the area are high.   The main reason why I give this place a 2 star is because every time we have been to this place  the waiting staff is the worst. The females are rude and literally sweep every woman that walks through the door in a judging way without contempt. They would rather chit chat at one corner of the room than assist you when you need something. We needed a 2nd round of drinks. It took our waitress over 45 minutes to check on our table  only after all 4 of us raised all our hands and left them raised high so she could assist us. This might be the reason why the food is cold.  I have to say this place had much better food and staff when it started. Now its overpriced for the quality of food and service you get.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,29,Hole in the wall. Food was good. Prices are high. Place is a bit dirty and rough around the edges for the price. Overall it was okay but I wouldn t go out of my way for it.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,30,Place is a bit hole in the wall but the food is actually really good  I am recommending.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,31,Charming restaurant beside the flea market is very convenient to me. Unfortunately the food isn t very good. The best things on the menu are the shrimp cocktails  which aren t as good as El Caribe s  but cost twice as much. Also good are the soups  but for half the price  the soups at Quality Seafood are better. And that is the theme of this place  no matter how nice the waitresses may be and no matter how close it is to my neighborhood  you don t have to go very far to get better food for less money.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,32,delicious aguas de horchata  Nachos are great  food is amazing  great drinks  and wonderful atmosphere.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,33,Bought a groupon for this place twice now and hope they put another one up again    It s a hole in the wall but has the best seafood I ve had in a long time especially since I m from the east coast which has the best seafood in the country. Highly recommended   Don t be afraid of the appearance because the food is amazing  
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,34,I loved this place  I ve been coming here for about a little over a year now. At times I can tell they are a little under staffed  but it doesn t bother me much. Especially since I use to be a waitress and I know how demanding people can be.  They have wonderful authentic Mexican food. Unlike generic  Americanized restaurants such as Chuy s  this restaurant is completely authentic and wonderful.  The atmosphere reminds me of an exact restaurant my parents and I use to eat at in Mexico. Not only is the taste good  but the portions of food are enough to feed a table of two for sure.  I do agree that they are a little pricey  but I do recommend trying this place out. They have huge projection screens on both ends of the restaurant which always seem to be airing Mun2  a Spanish music station .  It s wonderful and for sure a two thumbs up for me   
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,35,Kinda dirty inside and needs a coat of paint. Waiter doesn t listen and gives you the wrong drinks. When you re ready to order  he ll talk to his friends sitting at another table for 10 minutes first. Then  once you get your food you will have soupy mushy  lukewarm rice. Unexciting beans. Awesome beerita though  I want to like it more. I might give it another chance...we ll see...
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,36,Some of yall are crazy. This is one of my favorite places in town. I think the deal with a lot of places is you need to get the special dish in order for you to know how good it is. Here is is the seafood fajitas. I can understand going here and ordering just tacos and walking away saying blah. It would be like going to Saltlick and trying only the cole slaw and commenting how bland the food is. Sometimes it takes a few tries  I usually ask the waiter what everyone orders  or look around to see what the hot items is. That s what I did here. I have never seen anyone eating anything other that the seafood fajitas.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,37,Very authentic Mexican seafood with almost exclusively Mexican customers. Not the nicest place in terms of atmosphere and the neighborhood is a bit sketchy  but food and service was very good.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,38,Bad service  nasty side dishes  not worth  80 ticket. Not once did our waitress check on us.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,39,Haven t been there yet  but I read all the great comments and am so willing to try it out  
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,40,This place is the spot to go if you want some authentic Mexican shrimp Coctel. Definitely one of my favorites  along with the ceviche tostada. You ll want to pair the dish with a cold Mexican beer...I ve found this to be the ideal combo when eating seafood.  The location is a bit sketchy  and the place could use a bit more lighting inside. When I walk in it feels more like a traditional cantina that you would find in Mexico. The place is set up inside to host PPV boxing fights when they re available with a few screen projectors and sound system. On weekend nights they have karaoke going on  and it s fun to get up there and sing your favorite tune. Most of the participants sing traditional mexican songs but they have quite the variety in songs.  Here is how I would rate these things individually   the food I ve tried so far has been good and excellent presentation  Coctel de camaron  5 stars  tostada de ceviche  5 stars  fajita de mariscos 4.5 stars  didn t care for the cheese that it was topped off with  .  The location and outside appearance could be better given the price of the food and presentation of such is actually decent. The lighting on the inside needs to be different I feel to give the sense of ocean   beachside that you come to expect when eating Mexican seafood...I think the problem here is the lighting is optimized for karaoke setting  projector screens and has just been left that way.  Considering all of the above  I still give this place 5 stars because they have the potential to take this business to the next level.  Finally  I should add that I m Mexican and have lived in Mexico.  I have tried the authentic stuff. What I ve had from this restaurant meets or exceeds from the restaurants that I ve had in Mexico.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,41,Average food for above averages prices. So many other Mexican seafood joints to pick from  especially on Lamar. Def won t be going back..
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,42,Bought a groupon. Then we read the reviews and almost didn t go  but so glad we did  The TVs were all tuned to different channels - fun  The chips and hot sauce for the table were fresh and very good. The waiter was pleasant and friendly  and my husband got a chance to practice his Spanish. He ordered campechana with shrimp and octopus  I ordered shrimp cocktail  all excellent. The presentation was unexpectedly elegant - a large glass garnished with big nicely-cut pieces of very fresh fruit  cucumber and avocado. It looked beautiful and was as good as we ve had anywhere. We definitely will go back.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,43,Went here on a Groupon- thought it would be like a little hole-in-the-wall I used to frequent in my hometown. WRONG. Hole in the wall- yes. Good food no. Their ceviche is not ceviche- it all tastes like they buy the bulk frozen seafood from Sam s Club and then serve it  no seasoning  no anything. We tried several things on the menu and their drinks. Sad to see people call it  authentic Mexican . Sad because it means so many people haven t ever experienced good food  or service for that matter . I d much rather go spend the  75 for dinner and couple of drinks my sister and I spent elsewhere. Way over-priced  poor quality  and terribly bland. They had store bought tortilla chips  Make them  You know ceviche is supposed to be raw seafood  cooked  in lime. Not a trace of lime in it. Seafood soup had that Krab junk in it and the fish was extremely fishy... For me to say that is really saying something. And the shrimp cocktail is made with a ketchup base  wtf   It seriously offends my Mexican sensibilities. It is literally the worst seafood experience I have ever had- including the time I had an allergic reaction and my throat swelled shut- because at least it was delicious going down. There was no good part to this trip- not the atmosphere  not the eating of it  definitely not the paying for it  and not the two days of stomach unease after the visit.
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,44,Horrible service. Horrible food. I ordered the camarones Alfredo and the pasta was so mushy and bland. Never again
Mariscos Tampico Bar & Grill,45,I ate there for the first time recently and I must say  without hesitation that this was the worst Mexican food I ve ever had anywhere  any place  at any time. I ordered the  Chicken Enchiladas.  Big mistake. The stuffing was chicken  all right  but like it had been run through a blender  and with a flavor that was simply awful. And the accompanying rice and beans  They were fine. After all  what could they do to screw up rice and beans  But  we live and learn. And I ve learned the hard way to stay clear of this place. YUCK  
Taco Cabana,1,We actually had a somewhat decent late night  post-bar meal here   Stopping in on a Saturday night around 11PM  we simply wanted some tacos and a quesadilla.  The guy working the drive-thru was friendly and they made the food to order.  The food took a few mins to make  but it tasted decent.  The salsa and guac were actually decent.
Taco Cabana,2,Used to love going to the Taco C by UT campus not just when I was a student but many years after. The food was predictable  albeit for a chain  but the place was kept clean and the food consistent for what it was.   Then I walked into this location. Holy you know what. Almost every table dirty  which explains why no one was dining in   no one managing the registers and no one even remotely cognizant that customers may actually be in an establishment that serves food or provides a service    When someone finally did decide to come take my order they couldn t have been more smug and  frankly  unkind. Waited about 10 minutes for the steak quesadilla I ordered and it was kind of hurriedly thrown at me as yet another reminder of how unwanted me or any other customer was at this place of business.   When I finally got it home  well  I kinda felt like crying. It was the saddest  most underwhelming quesadilla that may have ever been made. Ever. And I didn t think poor me  not for a single moment. I thought about that poor employee that had been so unkind  so terse  so just well beat down seeming. The quesadilla was awful  the service was awful and this location is absolutely  unforgivably awful. But so is whatever lack of management exists to make employees be so awful to their customers and  even worse  keep them around. Close your doors for good if you can t even have some respect for your fellow human.
Taco Cabana,3,This was the worst taco cabana we have ever been in.  In general we think their food is acceptable as a fast food chain  we do not expect it to be fine dining  but this particular establishment has gone off the rails in food quality.
Taco Cabana,4,Came into this Taco Cabana and the  person in charge   who wouldn t give his name  told us that there wasn t any inside dining  even though there were people inside dining . When I asked why  he kept saying  goodbye sir . I was a frequent customer of this location for years  luckily I don t have to be any more. Goodbye Taco Cabana 
Taco Cabana,5,So many mixed feelings about this place. Apparently  due to covid  they still are not letting customers use the restrooms. Heaven forbid we want to wash our hands before we eat. With the restroom doors fully locked  I hope workers are washing their hands. The food is standard. What is completely free to add to your food inside  will cost you money if you ask for it in the drive thru. And when you mention this  they will shut the window in your face. The number of times I ve come here and they were out of  or just said they were out of  Beyond Meat  has made me only stop here when I really  really have a craving. And then I usually leave disappointed.
Taco Cabana,6,These are the  nachos  my wife received from this poorly ran establishment. Soggy  the chips that weren t soggy were stale. They refused to remake them and refused a refund.
Taco Cabana,7,On Thursday 6 3 7 54pm order number 323770  I stopped by to get some tortitas and queso because they are delicious and the taste of my favorite meals here are gone especially de fajitas and the rice is bland refried beans are bland as well   But let s get to the point I ask the gentleman at the register for some tortilla and queso there was only one costumer dining at that time he was in rush answering my question about the margaritas flavor I was trying to get one with chamoy for my wife but he was like I do whatever you want like I put chamoy on whatever s oy get but that was not my pointi was trying to get a good flavor with chamoy but not having someone rushing me for my order  anyway that gentleman was not friendly not welcoming my business I this the other manager lady is little better but you guys need to stay calm and have some good hospitality skills to work with public  Nope not planing to go back to this location    Please excuse my bad typing
Taco Cabana,8,If I could leave a negative 5 Stars I would. The manager hung up on me after getting my order wrong.   Drive through attendant refused to fix my order upon returning and threatened to throw my card on the ground.   Very unprofessional and dirty. Do not eat here.
Taco Cabana,9,The worst    Spoke with the manager who hung up on me twice  I ordered a steak taco combo and received one taco  No option to reconcile because they are to busy. I would give 0 stars if I could.
Taco Cabana,10,Taco cabana provides good food at a decent price. Parking lot is decent and the bathrooms are clean. I really like their happy hour nachos and margaritas. Abi and I shared one of each.
Taco Cabana,11,I am one of those patrons who can remember what taco cabana was like in the early 90s. The portions were extremely generous and as fresh as possible for a lot less money than you would expect to pay. And this formula went on for years which is why they were so very popular.  Fast forward to today and the vast majority of millennial s have no clue just how great they were back then. Several of their locations have now closed down especially the one I liked the most on South Lamar by town lake. Today those portions of fajita meat are carefully portioned out and tend be be dry and unappetizing. Nonetheless they keep their plates as close to under the  10 mark as they can which makes them at least affordable.  You do not go to taco cabana for an amazing meal  you go there because you want something good and cheap. Those days of trying to wow you with a lot of food for a cheap price are over but they still deliver to a limited extent. On occasion I still order their fajita plate because for less than nine dollars it s worth it and of course their salsa bar helps make the meal that much more enjoyable. My concern is that you can only hang on only so long by offering somewhat decent fare.  There is so much competition in the fast food restaurant market that I m worried that taco Cabana may not be around in the years to come.  I hope I m wrong.
Taco Cabana,12,Holy moly   Either some things have changed or this place is under new management.  This is fast food but the portions wouldn t suggest so.  The boys love their cheese enchiladas and tacos here and I really like the street tacos or flautas.  We came in over the weekend before a movie and were excited to see that they changed the portions to reflect more of the pricing.  I have a weakness for Taco C.  We will back before you know it.
Taco Cabana,13,The manager here is unnecessarily rude. He talks with this   hurry up and stop annoying me  kind of tone that comes off very instigating.  For example  in the drive thru we were getting two separate orders  same car. After saying the first order he replies     What else     That ll be it for that one    What else     Like  for the second order     Irritated sigh   What-else     Okay. For the second order...   While taking the order  he also didn t confirm any of the modifications  or anything that we ordered. At the window there were no apologies and no common curtesy of   please  or  thank you  Just repeats the total  and hands the card back with a sharp   Here.   There s been other dine-in visits I had where the same manager has been rude. I don t know his name  he doesn t wear a nametag.
Taco Cabana,14,This location has been a disappointment to me twice.  First time my order was drive thru and was wrong when I go home.  This time I decided to go inside and was treated very rudely.  I will never go back and I recommend you don t go to this location if you want a favorable experience.
Taco Cabana,15,I was ordering food in the drive thru. I asked the order taker that I would like 2 steak fajita tacos if the meat was fresh. Rudely he stated that he wouldn t serve anything old. I stated from previous experience the meat is bad. He disregarded my comment and said what else that I needed. I finished placing my order and drove up.  I asked him why he was rude. He mumbled something and took my card and closed the window. Then I said why he has to be a sick about it. Then he opens the window give me my card back and shuts the window. I eat at this location and others at least 3 times a week. He knows who I am.  He always seems bothered or irritated when I come through. He is always at the window. It s not my fault that he took it personal when I asked about the meat being fresh. In can go on and on about taco cabana customer services but it s nothing y all don t know.  Yes I parked my car at the window because he would speak to me about the situation. I was not rude loud or in any shape or form showing aggression. I just asked a question.  He ignored me then when I wouldn t move he wanted to talk to me. When he could of just calmly spoken to me not serve me and I would of drove off.  We use to work together he was rude then and still rude. Not my fault that you work at TC and your career is not going where you want it to be. I m saying this to you Daniel because you where the same way when you wheee tuning the Lamar location.  What you get out of life is what you put in to it. If your stuck in the same position earning the same salary do something about it. So many opportunities out here all you have to do is look believe in yourself and invest in yourself and doors will open. I hope this makes you mad enough at me to make you change good luck buddy.
Taco Cabana,16,Daniel the Manager worst employee here     He got my order wrong and when i ask for him to fix it be call me names without me asking in a bad way
Taco Cabana,17,Great food  Excellent service  Manager was super friendly. Place was clean and smelled amazing.
Taco Cabana,18,There was not only many hairs in my food it was tangled hair attached to a tiny rubber hair band  I don t think for a second it was an accident. From the drive-through you can see that no one was wearing gloves or anything so probably contracted coronavirus for all I know.Talk about disgusting and ridiculous. This food establishment is an embarrassment. Nobody should eat here and they should be shut down. Seriously the city food inspectors need to come out here because it is disgusting. Inspect your food thoroughly before investing or better yet don t come here. We were starving but it s best not to eat here even as a last resort.  So much for making matters right.... no response after I followed up. I guess just trying to look good.
Taco Cabana,19,Came here on a sunday at 2 20 pm and the drive thru guy is such an d ck head  while we were ordering this guy had such an attitude  things we would normally order from other taco cabanas he would just say   we dont do lbs of meat by themselves  or he would respond   of what  be specific  and in a rude way. Then when we were waiting for out food we could hear him talk rudely to other customers in the drive thru  Yes it comes with rice and beans   and then he told his co worker  este pendejo no sabe que esta ordenando  which means  this idiot doesnt know what he s ordering  and so yeah it was just annoying how this guy was just rude for no reason
Taco Cabana,20,I just got home from this location the man who took my order was very rude I understand maybe he was busy no need for rude I ask for no bean I got double beans and no salsa I work at a TC myself and that was terrible I don t care for a refund or replacement of food I just think this store should do better
Taco Cabana,21,Whoever took my order at this location not 5 seconds ago needs a real lesson in customer service. Not only was he a prick but the tool couldn t even put utensils in a togo bag. Way to be a kook. Eat shit
Taco Cabana,22,This used to be one of my favorite spots to stop in and grab a delicious meal. NOW  its horrible. I m so disappointed. Their customer service is appauling.   Coming in it s so dirty  the tables are not wiped down  there are left over trays on the tables and the floors look like they haven t been swept.   A BIG tip  get someone who actually can speak other languages other than huh .... it s annoying having to repeat oneself.   TACO CABANA NEEDS TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACT 
Taco Cabana,23,Full disclosure  I only come here for the tortillas. Here follows a review of the tortillas. - Fresh  Really solid  soft  fluffy  yummy tortillas. I can just straight eat these without anything else.  4 stars  - Two Days Later  I prefer store bought tortillas at this point. They re still good if you beat them up on he stove or in the oven  but I might only get these tortillas if I eat them the same day.  2 stars 
Taco Cabana,24,Let me start by saying the employees were trying their best to solve the problem and help me. That is the only reason this review comes with two stars instead of none.   I arrive at Taco Cabana around 9 10 am to order some food under the impression that they accept Apple Pay  I ve used it before both through the drive thru AND dine in and even called ahead to be 100  sure as it is my only form of payment right now as I await a replacement card for the one I lost . I order  the young man takes the order and per usual I say that the form of payment is going to be Apple Pay. The Verifone payment machine shows my total  12.38 and an image that says  Insert card with chip or swipe.  I immediately knew this isn t what a Apple Pay accessible Verifone looks like. And to no surprise  I try to pay but it doesn t work. I then ask for the manager who gladly comes over and agrees that they do in fact accept Apple Pay. After trying for 10 minutes  she says she hasn t done it in the dine in setting but definitely has at the drive thru. So I offer to go through the drive thru. She says thank you and continues to apologize and I assure her everything is okay. I load up my three year old  buckle her up  she was so frustrated at this point because she was hungry  and go through the drive thru. Again  it doesn t work. Frustrated I thank the employee and park off to the side. I check again on both google  yelp  and the official Taco Cabana site and they all state that Taco Cabanas  this one specifically ACCEPTS APPLE PAY IN BOTH DRIVE THRU AND DINE IN. I finally decided to just download the app  order online  park AGAIN  and pick up my to go order and dine in.  I cannot stress enough that the employees are not to blame   But Taco Cabana  come on  Please change your accepted payments options and provide your employees with the proper equipment to serve what is advertised.
Taco Cabana,25,Awful service. Consider going to a different location. Daniel s management is awful. He is very rude and impatient. He doesn t care about customers just wants to move the drive-thru line fast.
Taco Cabana,26,Drive through.  I would like a steak taco in a Crispy Shell.  Reply   We don t offer that  only beef or chicken.  Question   You can t put the steak filling in crispy taco shell   Reply   No  only ground beef or chicken.  Seriously folks   What is so hard about this request    Will never go back if I can help it.
Taco Cabana,27,Yes fast food but not Taco bell- LOVE me my Cabana- especially cheese enchiladas.  Don t bother with the margaritas ever though- the are awful.
Taco Cabana,28,So annoyed by my visit...enough to go on yelp and say something. I stopped by to get  quick  tacos for my girls before gymnastics and I was literally in the drive thru for 10 mins behind ONE car and no one behind me. The food was sooo disappointing. I ordered the chicken fajita tacos and it was just chicken and a tortilla and I paid  7 for it    Total Oder was  15...I had to double check that I didn t order double  No salsa  no peppers  no nothing   Not even one napkin. Erghhhhhh. You try giving kids a bean and cheese taco with no napkins    No thank you. So sad TC is worst than TB.  Update  Taco Cabana has apologized and I appreciate the response. I ve been back and it hasn t been nearly as bad 
Taco Cabana,29,So  this place isn t very good. I mean  often my bean and cheese taco has like 2 shreds of cheese and 700 pounds of beans. And like  the beans seem to have random bits of lettuce in them. and one time I could hardly taste ANYTHING but random bits of random stuff  I mean  it s not like the beans usually taste good ANYWAY    Ugh. very bad. And one time I was waiting in the drive through to pick up food  and I waited 25 MINUETS for ONE CAR to get their food. And then I had to wait for mine  Really       However  one time everything tasted ABSOULUTLY STINKEN DELICIOUS. But only ONE TIME. However  we were just about home from a long car trip and so I may have just been super carsick because I totally felt light-headed and I didn t feel good already so maybe is caused like a reverse-psychology thing and so now the food tastes great since I already felt awful    Don t know. Also not very clean. Don t like.
Taco Cabana,30,I came to Taco Cabana recently tonight at around 12 03a.m. I ordered The Trio Sampler  with NO PICO and i got EXTRA PICO instead. My chips for my queso were as STAIL as could be as for my girlfriends personal order of chips. HIGHLY disappointed with the service especially. Manager was rolling eyes and making faces. Definitely never returning.
Taco Cabana,31,From a customer stand point  I feel sorry for the employees that work there with the apparent  management  they have. I pulled up to the window and overheard the  manager  being negative towards his employees and then with me. I ordered 2 fajita tacos and he wanted to charge me like  7 when the sign said a special of 2 for   5. Then was far less than hospitable  explaining  to me how it was my fault. DUDE   Switch to de-caf. I will not be back...
Taco Cabana,32,I used to come here frequently several years ago   long before the remodel. I ve been twice now recently and it s just not the same place. The counter staff take a looong time to take your order and they frequently don t get it right. My last visit two people returned their food  while I m in line  because something wasn t right about their order.  The place was mostly empty at prime breakfast time  which I now understand. My tacos were good  and I really enjoy the fresh salsa bar  but the service and general attitude of the employees is sad. There are other TC s around so I would recommend going to one of them.
Taco Cabana,33,I ve only tried Taco Cabana once when we first moved here and I wasn t impressed.  I ate here again yesterday and it was pretty darn good   I got the taco salad in a crispy shell.  I tried ordering a bowl  no shell  but the lady at the cash register had no idea what I was talking about which was extremely frustrating because English wasn t her first language.  She also told me it didn t come with beans  which is does.   They left off the chips and queso off of my co-workers order and the girls in front of us order was incorrect as well.  I tried not to hold up the line by confusing the lady at the register and just ordered the taco salad with the crispy shell and black beans and it was GOOD   Very impressed.  You can tell all of the ingredients are pretty good quality.  They are pretty much a couple of notches over Taco Bell.  I will definitely be back by I think I ll try the North Lamar or Burnet locations instead.
Taco Cabana,34,I remember the old Taco Cabana  Fast drive in service  Variety of great breakfast tacos such as barbecoa  amp  carne guisada. And the tacos were packed  amp  larger. It was 24 hour service. But today  It s all gone downhill  Service is horrible  It s like they took away what customers enjoyed the most  It just a matter of time when they start to close down  I am looking for another taco place that offers what TC has abandoned. Bye Bye TC  Thanks for the memories 
Taco Cabana,35,Really frustrating to go to a place consistently and one out of every three times they get my order wrong and I have to wait in line again at the drive through or park my car and go inside   This past time they forgot to put sauce on my enchiladas and when I went back they said they d remake them so they d be hot  so I waited for 15 minutes for them to remake them and then they put cheese instead of chicken in theM  ugh
Taco Cabana,36,They do not listen to your order and if they do they make your order then give you attitude when they have to remake the order I ordered the brisket bowl and burrito and only received the bowl and was told I never order the burrito and was told if you want it then pay for it and y all get it. They then turn around and made the two people behind me the wrong orders and told them that s what they ordered and if they wanted anything else they will have to pay for it. I will never be returning hear. This was the worst customer service I have ever received at a food establishment I think they need to have corporate come down and either clean house or do some retraining on customer service.
Taco Cabana,37,I ve been ordering black bean tacos from TC for well over a decade. Ordered some at the drive through here tonight and was told   We don t do that.  Not  We re out   or anything else that might actually make sense. Just  We don t do that.  Okay. They also messed up the rest of the order  but that s something I ve just come to expect from this location.
Taco Cabana,38,Waited 5  minutes for service  and the lady had manicured nails that prevented her from taking our order the first time. The food is edible  but the restaurant is dirty with cups and napkins everywhere. It always looks like the lunch rush happens if you go inside. Management and owner don t care about hygiene. Pathetically wilted tomatoes and stale chips. Stick to drive thru if you even come at all.   Check out their dulce de leche in the image attached.
Taco Cabana,39,Not sure what was worse  the service or the food.   Had to wait way too long for my order and then the food wasn t even worth waiting for. Very disappointed.
Taco Cabana,40,Not as advertised.  Not how it used to be.  Minuscule portions.  Overpriced.  Impersonal.  Food is just so-so.
Taco Cabana,41,I m really happy that they have breakfast all day now  but no barbacoa .  This location provides the usual quick Tex-mex fast food on good tortillas.
Taco Cabana,42,The last time I came here like 2 years ago they had a bean and cheese taco combo and I was really excited to come back and get it again now that I m back in Austin but they didn t have it anymore so that was kind of disappointing. Maybe I m just the only one who likes it and that s the problem. It s a heavy burden and I will carry it with me for all the rest of the days of my life.
Taco Cabana,43,I honestly didn t experience any of The bad things mentioned in other comments.  I went through the drive-through during rush hour on my way to work and ordered a Coke and a beef fajita taco. With two cars in front of me I was completely through the line within three minutes and my food was fresh and hot.  This was the exact opposite of my experience with the Taco Cabana on Lamar.
Taco Cabana,44,Too Pricey for us.  Other than that  the food s great  the Service friendly  and it s busy enough to stay in business but never over crowded.  The argument could be made that the pricey food  compared to similar establishments  is due to getting what you payed for  but with a large family it s just a bit too much. The sad fact is that this is largely due to Taco Cabana s inability  through no fault of their own  to acquire tax benefits that global chains receive.  Honestly  if money isn t an issue and you want good quality Mexican Food in a nice environment  you should go here.
Taco Cabana,45,I ve given this location numerous tries but they always tend to have a very very very long wait time for food on drive through it s pretty ridiculous.
Taco Cabana,46,Met friends for happy hour.  There were less than 10 people in the whole restaurant.... And they ran out of Margaritas    How the hell can a Mexican restaurant run out if Margaritas at 6 15pm        -   However  the food was good.  So was the pitcher of margaritas that we did have.    - 
Taco Cabana,47,used to be the place to go ... circa 1980 something  grill was NOT on   fired    or grilling anything  guacamole was nasty  NOT made in-house  so they have a salsa bar ... BIG WOO -- all food comes frozen  pre-packed from either Sysco  US Foods  or BEK  which is not a crime  UNLESS your business is advertising as  fresh prepared    NOTHING IS GRILLED  FRESH  OR EDIBLE
Taco Cabana,48,worst manager ever  cant control her team cant ring an order correctly  cant take ownership of her mistakes and cant communicate like an adult. Manager working on kims register sunday august 2 2015 at 10 00am.  I waited 6-8 minutes to be greeted by mgr who took my order while crew stood around. my food was completely wrong not because of staff because she didnt ring any of it up correctly. When i called back she blamed me n hung up  theni called the hotline and stayed on hold for 8.43 minutes.  Never again
Taco Cabana,49,I thought I would jet through this Taco Cabana s drive through for a quick taco this afternoon.  Well  my first mistake was thinking that I would  jet  through anything  after giving my order to someone who sounded like he could not care less about his job or my order and a total 20 minutes in line  I pulled out of the line  parked  and walked inside to get my food.  TOTAL CHAOS.  The place reeked of sewer gas  and the assistant manager  the senior-most person I could find  seemed kind of spaced out.  I explained the problem and that I was in a hurry  and she made a lot of noise bitching at multiple people to get something to happen  yet it was STILL 10 minutes before I got out of the place with my food.  It is notable that it was NOT busy  this was 2 30 in the afternoon on a Sunday .  I still can t figure out how hard it must be to put together two damn tacos and hand them off that it takes TEN minutes   When I informed the asst manager that it stunk in there  after a few minutes  my nose adjusted and I couldn t smell it anymore  but it was still there  so I thought maybe she thought it had gone away    she told me that it had been like that for a while  that the pipes in the building were old.  So much about this experience made me a little sick to my stomach to think about the food coming out of this place that I ended up eating very little of it. Notably  after I d been inside 10 minutes  they STILL hadn t gotten the person who had been ahead of me in the drive through line taken care of  and there had only ever been 2 people in front of me  one drove off  angry  before they could ever get to the window .  I love Taco Cabana  but I will venture a little further up the road to the one in the Arboretum before I ll ever darken the doors of this one again.  SO GROSS.
Taco Cabana,50,I haven t been to Taco Cabana in 19 yrs and was looking forward to the experience again. Once we ordered our food  the cashier took my debit card to another machine even though the guy in front of me was rang through at the counter. I thought it suspicious at the time. 12 hours later  Wells Fargo notified me that my card had been compromised with several fraudulent charges. Dine here at your own  financial  risk.....
Taco Cabana,51,The food is good and fast plus cheap for every body allso they serve beer too ooo yes
Taco Cabana,52,Be prepared to wait up to 5 minutes before they great you and place your order. Happens every time at this location. After 5 times it was time to make a note of it.
Taco Cabana,53,These guys are rude and incompetent. They also charged me for queso and didn t give it to me. Beware 
Taco Cabana,54,They took forever to take my order  got it wrong  and then were rude about correcting it. Im a vegetarian and told them I can not eat their refried beans. They redid my order with black beans and  by no accident I m sure  put bits of steak in the black beans. I have a short lunch break  so this is one of my only options. I ll skip lunch before I go back here. Jerks.
Taco Cabana,55,I crave ye yet I knowest ye betrayest me.  Thy salsa bar of lore fills the cilantro shaped vacuum in my soul with thine fresh wares.  And thou doest woo me with a bouquet of fresh tortillas and tempt me with thine nachos of chicken.  Thou contents mine inner tempest... only to awaken a much larger tempest  like an hour later .  Thou doest please my palette but alas ye are but fleet of foot fare.   translation   you taste good but you re still fast food  
Taco Cabana,56,Cabana bowls are good when you are broke and hungry. For under  4 you get a giant taco shell shaped into a bowl. Inside the shell-bowl are beans  rice  meat  cheese  sour cream  guacamole and pico de gallo. It s big  it s cheap  and it s my favorite fast food. Hit up the salsa bar for lime and cilantro  and the green salsa isn t bad when mixed with everything. The red salsa is always watery  but I use like 4 little cups of it anyway  I am a salsa freak.   Anywho  that isn t even what I ate last night. My lady-friends and I were hungry  but did not want to spend an arm and a leg on food. So my friend Amber suggested Taco C. I got a soft beef taco combo and a regular margarita. The taco s were fine about a million times better than taco hell  and the margarita was ok. You definently get what you pay for here.  But after we were done with our food  we wanted to get out of there  and all still had over half of out margs left. My friend poured the rest of her margarita in the cup that comes with the combos  genius. I know the employees saw us doing that  but no one stopped us. Thank you Taco C employees for letting us have margaritas to-go 
Taco Cabana,57,I stopped by this Taco Cabana after a frustrating search for a nearby bookstore. I wasn t angry or impatient  because I found my quarry with just enough time to browse before they closed. So I was a bit taken back by the drive-thru person s curt and rather terse service. I might have been talkative  if I hadn t been stunned by the semi-subtle way the guy cut me off  and made me feel uncomfortable for the rest of the transaction.  I m not a sissy  so I  didn t storm off. I may have been a bit slow to realize that the involuntary glare I shot this twirp  might have affected the quality of the food I received. I m not completely naive  though. I watched them assemble the order as much as possible  and I looked it over carefully when I got back to my room.  The nachos looked like they shook them like a tossed salad  and the refried beans and cheese  what little they put on  was cold  though the drive back was brief. Half of the tortilla chips had no cheese on them  and the chips on the bottom were soggy. The plate was also sloppily assembled  with red sauce and oil from the puny enchiladas were all over everything else.  I had assumed that all Taco Cabanas were the same. But I ve never had food or service like that at any other location. There won t be a second chance from me  it just seemed too deliberate
Taco Cabana,58,It s late. TC s is your last  and only  choice.  It s just there. Live with it. Eat that taco. You ll like it. Now go to bed and quit yer bellyachin . Literally. That s what I tell myself.  I think everyone raised in Texas had that time in their life when Taco Cabana was like  the BOMB. Where did YOU first learn what a quesadilla was  If you say mexico  you re a big fat liar.
Taco Cabana,59,I don t know why my friend likes Taco Cabana quesadillas so much.  They are way too salty and not tasty.  Maybe for fast food and late night standards they are acceptable.  This Taco Cabana is located on 183 across Charles Maund Toyota.  It is west of Brake Specialists Plus.  It seems really popular.  I won t come here again.
Taco Cabana,60,i just stopped by the drive thru and the customer service was horrible. this was my first time there and when we pulled up to the window they kept closing it on us and not answer any questions. i will not be back and i would not recommend this place to any one else.
Taco Cabana,61,I regularly have large portions of my order missing from at this location. Who ever owns it needs to address it.
Taco Cabana,62,17 minutes in the drive through to get 2 tacos. Cars are pulling out of line due to the wait. This location is understaffed. It seems to be a common problem at this location.
Taco Cabana,63,Slowest taco c ever. Drive thru is a joke. If it weren t so close to my house I would never go to this location.
Taco Cabana,64,I just had a terrible experience with the night crew. There was absolutely noone ahead of me  and still noone came to take my order. Ive eaten here dozens of times  but tonight  after ten minutes of just standing there like an idiot and making eye contact with all of them  not a single one bothered to come up to me.
Taco Cabana,65,My last experience at this location was terrible. I went about a month ago. I ordered a kids meal with an enchilada and they brought me a quesadilla. When I told them that wasn t what I ordered and my kid didn t want it  the cashier went to fix it. Then  another employee came out with a bad attitude and asked   OK  what did you say   I explained to her  with the same attitude she approached me with  that I wanted an enchilada meal. She proceeded to snatch my receipt while mumbling   He can take care of this . I couldn t believe what had just happened. I should ve known it wasn t going to be a good experience when I saw two other people demand their money be refunded because their orders were messed up as well. The manager was very nice and corrected their mistake  but I m going to stick with the Burnet location which has always had great service and great food.
Taco Cabana,66,There is something about this place.  It feels good  or the food is good  or I feel close to mexican food  whatever  the food is always nice and good to eat. Staff is supportive.  My friends like this place and so do I. Overall I would visit this place frequently  good to try out......
Taco Cabana,67,I had been going to this location for years off and on  yet on  my last couple of visits it has left me disheartened....the first was in arrival  there was no greeting and the  small-one order took even longer  than before. I was handed my order with no apology for the delay and it seemed  as if I was the one bothering him...this last time  I placed my order for my fajitas and alot of the order was  off  in taste  the rice was fair  the beans seemed overcooked  the meat was closely burnt  on some edges...even the condiments tasted stale..the jalapeno tasted like it was a week over and the others were getting close to that bad sour taste  not eventful.   Very disappointing  yet luckily no after effects.  The waitstaff were very courteous and attentive  yet some of the cleanliness left something to be desired.
Taco Cabana,68,Great late night food stop.
Taco Cabana,69,Since I am on this website I want to share my experiences now. I live close to this place so I hope you don t think I am too much of a dummy to keep going back for misery. The last time I had my to go order 100 percent accurate  18 months ago. However  the real reason I wrote this review  I am poor  on a small income  so I always order my tacos with a couple extra tortillas to make my stomach and budget stretch but last Thursday I was told that I cannot order extra tortillas. It thought they were joking  they are not free to begin with  but I wonder if they were discriminating with me personally as there were customers not appearing to have restrictions with their orders. Sometimes you run out of something but out of tortillas  That is like McDonald s telling me they are out of hamburgers  Maybe they should close the business instead of wasting my time trying to order lunch when a Vital ingredient of their menu is out of service. And the  I don t care  attitude and lack of understanding and care I receive every visit I can think over the past couple of years is the true motivation for writing this post at 2 25 in the morning instead of sleeping. I find the employees lazy  I don t care attitude towards me and the other customers time and time again even more baffling then Taco Cabana running out of tortillas  After two years of abuse I finally figured out they don t want me there. I was so uncomfortable this last time that I left before they called my order that I paid for
Taco Cabana,70,This place is horrible .   If you want to spend your hard earned money and get nothing in  return   fine. I dont.   I ordered fajita nachos  only 1 3 of my nachos had cheese. I did not get my sour creme and guacamole for my quesadillas nor did I get my chips that  came with the chips and queso. Service was less than desirable. Crabby service and a long wait .   I did thier online survey hoping to get some resolve out of this and I have yet to hear back from them. I love thier food  but they have gone way down hill.   Sad but true. Kids  lesson learned  dont waste your money here  your better off with some velveeta and a can of Rotel.
Taco Cabana,71,The only I hate about this place is that they rush you when you re ordering and when they screw up my order. Besides that  everything is yummy.
Taco Cabana,72,Pretty tasty for late night food. Carne asana was pretty good. Tortillas were spongey and awesome. They got our order wrong a few times over the intercom and ultimately we were missing a couple of things in the order  and they have some weird policy where they make you drive away from the window so you re not waiting at the window  it was weird. But for late night food  it was good.
Taco Cabana,73,This place is very unprofessional. I ordered a few things and the worker Jermy charged me and only gave me 1 of the items I ordered. The food I did get was cold dry and not tasty. I will never pick this Taco Cabana again.
Taco Cabana,74,If you want what you ordered do not go here... I stopped coming here cuz they kept messing up... have them the benefit of the doubt today and that is my mistake. Apparent chicken and old beef tacos are the same to the people that work here. I won t even go get my money back because I never want to set foot in this nasty place again. Close it and put a Taco Bell here  atleast they get my order correct  plus if they don t I m not throwing  10 away....
Taco Cabana,75,It s fast food  but for fast food it s pretty good. My friend and I walked down here from discount tires because they were taking forever to get our truck done. The inside and outside we re very clean. This was my first visit to this particular chain  and I didn t feel like the wait was too long in line to order  especially considering the amount of orders in front of us. I ordered a chicken fajita burrito sans pico de gallo. It was very good  and extremely hot and fresh  when it came out. The time it took for them to get our order together was neglible  and the service was friendly.
Taco Cabana,76,I like taco cabana just fine. This place smelled like sewage though. The men s bathroom actually smelled better than the dining room.
Taco Cabana,77,BEWARE  I order to breakfast tacos.  When I bit into one of them  there was a piece of hard plastic the circumference of dime  and the thickness of two dimes.  Almost broke my tooth.  The plastic looked like it was from a broken dish.    I called customer service  800 number  and spoke to a live person who took a message.  However  no one ever returned my call.
Taco Cabana,78,I have only been to this location one time  but it was terrible. I just ordered some tacos to go  and there was more cheese in the bottom of the bag then on the tacos. The taco meat tasted like a bunch of salt was dumped on it  and it was super greasy. These were by far the worst tacos I had ever had. I would have rather had a Taco Bell taco that was put in a refrigerator and then heated in the microwave and had hot lettuce on it. The other thing is their credit card machine was down  and they were were asking to write down credit card numbers to enter them later. I opted for the cash method of payment.
Taco Cabana,79,I placed my order on 8 17 during a drive thru visit. When I returned home I realized my order was not made correctly and was missing items. I have never been treated so horribly in my life. Not only did I call to complain the Manager I spoke with Juana had a bad attitude  amp  was rude with me. I could not return that day because I had just picked up and gotten all my children home. I went in today as I was told I can go in whenever and have my whole order remade just to bring the receipt. The I m assuming shift manager heavy set woman  I spoke to was rude and evasive. I was told that she called the mgr and she said she didn t work that day and No one called to make a complaint at all and my order would not be remade and to leave. The woman I spoke with had an attitude and whispered BITCH  as I was leaving. This was going to be my children s lunch today for me to take them while on my Lunch break.So I was upset when leaving. I worked for TC in 07 and can not believe costumers are treated this way. i will not be returning and will let everyone know VIA social media how horrible this location is. I would appreciate a refund. And or Possibly my order remade at another location. I work in a corporate office and would be appalled if any of my employees every behaved so horribly. PLEASE REACH ME VIA EMAIL  I AGAIN AM VERY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED IN EVERYTHING THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE WITH THIS STORE. I can not blame the company for unsatisfactory workers with bad work ethic.   I CANT BELIEVE HOW HORRIBLE THEY TREAT YOU AT THIS LOCATION 
Taco Cabana,80,Gave them a second chance by going to the location and asking to speak with a manager...since they never responded to my e-mail complaint....assnt manager was very cordial and very apologetic which is the only reason for the second star in this review as she made a valid attempt to offer to fix the situation and said she would make sure the manager called me.   Only problem was they replaced my screwed up order and again didn t give me all of my order as they forgot my fajita taco yet again   
La Caprichoza,1,Chicarron  amp  Tripas Tacos and a Delicious Fresh Semisweet Mango Water after working a Q2 Soccer Game. Mexico City connections to this Delectible Eating. Orange Chili del Arbol salsa will light U up  La Caprichoza Taco Trailer 7am to 10pm every day closed Sunday. Open later on Q2 Soccer Gamedays. Located in Sunoco parking lot Braker   Burnet. Yall can bet that I will return again  Dr Wiley Coyote SFO...
La Caprichoza,2,Kind  friendly people run this food truck. The quality of its food is significantly better than the photographs on its side panel menu.   They recommend their tacos above all else  and their pastor offering features pork bits  no grist   coated with a pleasant achiote sauce  nestled on your choice of tortilla  and adorned with the requisite chopped fresh cilantro  chopped onion  lime slice and a choice of salsas.   If you re hungry  it will do nicely.   The carnitas taco was a wee bit dry  despite being  maciza   or so he said.
La Caprichoza,3,Got a semi burnt tostada that was more lettuce than I would expect for a  5 tostada. It did include a little meat  crema and some queso fresco and a small layer of refried beans. The meat was tasty. I also ordered a Mexican coke that was a touch colder than room temp. I m sure they have better things on the menu  but I wouldn t recommend either of these.
La Caprichoza,4,Good food. I enjoyed my quesadilla of squash blooms  my younger son enjoyed his burger  my older son his tacos al pastor and my wife her pork and hitlacoche tacos. Nice change from the usual Tex-Mex.
La Caprichoza,5,The truck hasn t been on E 6th for a few months  but I saw it in the vicinity of Congress Stassney recently.
La Caprichoza,6,Ordered 3 tacos then ate 2 more. The fajita and chicharon  pork belly  were great. Pork ears  amp  shrimp are worth trying too.
La Traila,1,Grabbed a few tacos while at the gas station  was shocked at how much I liked em. Homemade tortillas is the key
La Traila,2,Came to the gas station for gas. While pumping I could smell their truck. I had to order something. Ordered 2 la gringas along with the red salsa. They were incredible to say the least  Can t beat that price either. If you re in the area  I would highly suggest making a pit stop here.
La Traila,3,Quaint taco truck on the side of Exxon near my place. They close at 4pm  so it s a breakfast and lunch joint. They have breakfast tacos as well as regular Mexican tacos and tortas  etc. I ve had both breakfast tacos and pastor and carne asada tacos here  and they were so quick and yummy. Good customer service. Authentic 
La Traila,4,Hands down. One of the best cheap tacos in austin. Pretty good quality and made fresh and hot.. very nice hard working ladies and quick service   Please support local business.. they are just too good  
La Traila,5,Best taco truck in Austin. My family loves this place and the people are amazing. Go here  
La Traila,6,Went back after a year tacos are good but I used cash. Left a cash tip of my choice not just added to my credit card. I ll try it a few more times and update from there.
La Traila,7,Great Tacos. Great People. I am not sure about the credit card getting charged 25  but I would watch out for that. They are open at 0600 in case you go to work early like I do
Taco Bell,1,I just want to say Alex who I believe is the manager  is one of the best managers I ve ever seen working in a good place. He gets in the grind  is nice even when you as the customer makes a mistake  is fast and really cares about his store. I can definitely see him managing more than one restaurant. Good work everyone there.   Ps  they actually put the correct amount of cheese if their quesadillas.
Taco Bell,2,Very disappointed. First time going to this location and went to the drive-thru when the young lady told me the drive-thru was down and we had to order inside only. Weird but okay  I ordered inside and the lady was very nice taking my order and the food was ready very fast. Got home and every single taco had cold meat and tasted like it was old. As a former restaurant manager this entire experience was very disappointing and I think food standards need to be checked at this location.
Taco Bell,3,I have been here almost every other week for the past year and a half and have never received my food cold  which was often my experiences at other stores. Both night and day crew kill it every time and should be getting paid for the quality they consistently put out. Love my east parmer store
Taco Bell,4,This locations sucks. I don t think I ve ever received an order that wasn t missing something.
Taco Bell,5,I used to think the people who worked at this location were incredibly nice. Now I think they are lazy children that should be reprimanded for not doing their job. I ordered door dash because I am sick with covid. Whomever worked tonight 7 2 22 this concerns them. I ordered door dash at 10 45pm. My driver started pushing back the time. 11 30 rolls around and she calls. She apologized and said they didn t receive a door dash notification and would not help her. COMPLETE LIE. She also said they closed at 11 00 that night and would not be helping her. Whomever the manager is... did you guys close at 11  Seems like a bunch of lazy kids not doing there job.
Taco Bell,6,I really like this Taco Bell location and I ve never had any issues any time I ve needed my Taco Bell fix.      On my most recent visit on 6 1 2019 my daughter  amp  I ate inside and not only is this Taco Bell location very clean but the employees are very friendly.   Shout out to employee Alexandra  who was so patient  amp  very friendly with me when I was trying to figure out what to order and she did a great job of explaining the  5 Taco boxes to me  amp  is what we both ended up getting.     I totally recommend the Taco Boxes  which come with 5 items  including a drink and cinnamon twist.   See you later Taco Bell  030263    -Rebecca our
Taco Bell,7,Customer service was shit .  Took them forever for. 2 grilled cheese Burrito  It was only beans in a cold Tortia wasn t even wrapped
Taco Bell,8,Update  things have gotten better seems like they figured it out  drive thru is faster and employees are nicer.
Taco Bell,9,Stopped by for dinner tonight. The girl In the drive thru is amazing. Very friendly  even asks hello how are you tonight  Etc. other fast food places you pull up and get a  how may help you  or  you ready   It just makes such a huge difference. Always fast  accurate and great. Best Taco Bell ever
Taco Bell,10,Always stop by here to grab a snack because of the quick friendly staff  but today the guy taking my order was completely rude  I always ask what kind of freeze drinks they have since sometimes they don t have a certain kind  when I asked  what kind of freeze drinks do y all have   the guy answers with  the ones that are on the menu  so that threw me off but I tried to ignore his attitude about it  I proceeded to order the kind we wanted  amp  he interrupts me with  we don t have the red one . Throughout all my order he kept saying  what else .  --What happened to the staff that was previously there that actually greets you when you approach the speaker  
Taco Bell,11,Simply rude. Tried to ask an employee a question. I even asked her the question in the sweetest tone ever. She rudely answered and rolled her eyes. Other employees also ignored me. Customer service is horrible. Todays night crew needs some customer service training to do.
Taco Bell,12,You know when you make your order  then roll up to pay and ask for an extra item that could be made quickly  with only one car behind you ...ever did that ..do you get your extra item  more times than not you do. WELL not here    I ordered a bean burrito and a 7 layered nacho off the value menu...I roll up and ask for another burrito  the cashier looked confused  what...this never happens   he goes to make the request for it and the cooks tell him no..  wait  what    So I m thinking he was kidding and made the request again. He apologized and said that they  the cooks  weren t kidding. So I go inside and ask for the manager.  The GM was helping someone else at the register  thee were like 3 people in there eating  and he comes over and I tell him the deal  he apologizes and states that he didn t make that rule  but the DM did ...and that person quit THAT day...the guy looks a little exhausted to be honest but he made my burrito and didn t charge me.  Was also told that a string of DMs have come and gone...that location needs some serious attention  obviously morale id in the crapper and its just a crap ran taco bell. I reflected these same thoughts at  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Ftellthebell.com amp s 2462d844a9611d7becb94d6cc9c66faa178fcf07bb6b28069f306564020946d1  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  tellthebell.com  a .  The food  the burritos were decent...wait  the one the manager made was...and those 7 layered nachos  looked more like a blob of cheese smacked onto broken chips...awesome.  I got a  Maverick  badge for eating here..guess that s what you earn when you eat at a sketchy place.  win 
Taco Bell,13,The only Taco Bell in the nation  maybe the world  with good customer service. They are so incredibly friendly at this location  it baffles me. The manager of those location needs a promotion or at the very least a raise.
Taco Bell,14,Absolutely best Taco Bell I ve every been to  Every employee that spoke to me was so kind and had a great attitude  You could tell they cared about giving customers a good experience plus all my food came out right even with my many modifications  which most other locations I have visited always mess up . Definitely will stay committed to visiting this location   
Taco Bell,15,I love every Taco Bell. They all get 5 stars. Starting to piss me off with taking things off the menu though
Taco Bell,16,Ate here the other night and have been terribly sick ever since. Haven t been out anywhere else during this time and now my doctor has sent me to go get tested for COVID...causation and correlation... to be determined.
Taco Bell,17,I am writing this because I had exceptional customer service from the guy who took my order and gave me my food today.  He was very friendly  pleasant and made me want to come back.   Just wanted to give kudos to him 
Taco Bell,18,Great drive thru experience today. Alex was so nice and upbeat taking our order. We got the food right away  we were in the drive thru less than 5 minutes total. I haven t been here in well over a year so I m glad it was such a great experience and the Crunchwrap is better than I remember  The skittles freeze is also amazing  way better than the old starburst one. Love this location  we will be back 
Taco Bell,19,Sometimes you just want to put shit in your body knowing full well of the ramifications of doing so  side note - that also involves shits later . We go to Taco Bell once in a while  maybe 4 times a year. I need you guys to have all the ingredients on those 4 days. Come on guys  out of cheese  Really  The 3-cheese blend missing chapula did hit the cravings spot but still left a spot empty  the spot reserved for the 3 types of cheeses i was so wanting  Service was fast and friendly.
Taco Bell,20,Great drive through experience this evening  Everything in the order was correct  food came out hot and fast.
Taco Bell,21,Had to downgrade the rating due to a poor customer service experience we received on a return visit a while ago. We visited this location several times with no issues except for the last visit. It was near closing time but we had 10 minutes left to order our food using the drive-thru. As the lady was taking our order  we heard the loud and whiney voice of a male in the background blatantly complaining on having to make our order.  When we pulled to the window to pay  you could easily hear the same guy in the back raising his voice about having to make our food and crying about how he didn t want to do his job. It was sadly pathetic for a grown man to sound this way. For crying out loud  it was only a few items. They told us the menu selection was limited as well. He was so obviously loud about it and we were made to be very uncomfortable. To make matters worse  they flicked the lights off with minutes left on the clock before closing time.  We won t be returning here again.
Taco Bell,22,My wife was getting off of work and me and my daughter wanted a late snack so we asked here to stop by taco bell and get a box of tacos. We live about 2 min away from this restaurant so it did not take her long to get them to us but by the time we got them they were saugy almost like when you pour a cup of water on a peice of bread
Taco Bell,23,I honestly wouldn t give this store a star period just went less than 20 mins ago ordered 2 steak nacho plates and 2 5 layer burrito. Also Ordered a watermelon freeze and two apple impinadas they forgot our impinadas and my watermelon freeze. My 2 burritos had barely no meat look like they took a baby spoon and called it alright to serve. It was mostly cheese bean and sour cream very dissapointing. I called to say there was no meat in my burrito and the lady didnt apologize for the mistake and ask what I wanted to do. With a very unpleasant voice. I m a local customer who goes in there a lot and always got a unhappy meal shut this mf down.   I will be calling the store owner  
Taco Bell,24,i ma give y all 5 stars cause the grilled cheese burrito that is just sumn else  i ve never ever tasted anything so scrumptious. if y all ever want a burrito that tastes so good get that grilled cheese one it s pretty good
Taco Bell,25,Until management changes hands  I won t bother with this location. The last two times I ve visited were bad experiences. Once  at the drive-thru  around 9 30 or so  I finally made my way to the speaker  there were about 5 or 6 cars ahead of me   and the guy actually suggested I go elsewhere because  we re really behind and slow tonight.  Thinking he was kidding  I asked if the wait was going to be 10 minutes or so. He said  No... Longer. It ll be more like... I wouldn t even order ma am.  What the what...   The last time  my family was walking toward the door to dine in  and the couple ahead of us was met at the door by an employee who said they weren t serving because enough people didn t show up for work. He proceeded to lock the door. It was 2 30 in the afternoon. WHAT. THE. WHAT    I called Corporate  and they are passing my issue on to the field office  not the store manager  since the problem seems to be WITH that person.
Taco Bell,26,This is one of the worst Taco Bells.  It s slow even when there are only two cars in the drive thru. They get part of your order wrong more often than not and they are constantly out of something.   Like taco shells  Taco shells   No tacos at the Taco Bell tonight.
Taco Bell,27,Breakfast time  So this morning I came to this Taco Bell location and their not open yet  and they supposed to be serving breakfast but they have a sign on the drive-tho order saying  sorry we are until 830  my thing is how y all have breakfast don t open until 830 most and many ppl are at work by this time so what s the point of advertising that y all have breakfast but start so late and plus on the yelp said y all are open but y all are not open    
Taco Bell,28,Consistent  Consistently Bad. I like Taco Bell and was excited about it coming to our area. Visited this establishment several times. In hopes that my experience this time would be...different...better. They have consistently disappointed. Why  No one is in the dining area  yet every table is dirty. The floor has food and trash everywhere you look. I ve brought it to the attention of management several times. One time  that I complained they actually sent someone out to clean. I give up...
Taco Bell,29,The wait was a little long  but the food was fresh and the service was great.  They didn t fully understand fulfill the order the way it was ordered  but it ended up working out fine either way. If you get the chance try the new Wild Spicy Naked Chalupa with Queso Dip on the side  two should suffice  - you ll thank me later 
Taco Bell,30,Every table was dirty and service was extremely slow. The place is empty and the drive thru is slow. Food all over seats as well. Bad management.
Taco Bell,31,In the morning time the food is good and fresh  But there evening crew needs some help always out of rice cheese just the basic stuff   last time i went i asked for the chlopa supreme combo and thy always give old crusty burnt shell it took them two tries to get it right   i have asked them without the beef but thy both had beef in them so i dont know how hard is it to listen for the ingredient and push a button   late night shift is a joke because there is no adult preset to keep the 18yr olds. Just sad
Taco Bell,32,This was a miserable experience. I went into the dining room to get food to go. I was ignored for several minutes before an employee who was working the drive through finally came to take my order. She tried to log into the register  than stated she didn t know who the drawer belonged to and went back to the drive through. I was ignored for a few more minutes before a manager logged into to the register  told someone it was okay  and after a while  someone took my order.  The real kicker came when I tried to pour myself some iced tea.  The spout came off and tea started shooting everywhere--over me  over the floor  over everything. I yelled for help  and an off duty employee who was hanging out in the dining room rushed in to stick his finger in the spout. He told me to tell someone what happened. I called for help  and someone did come to rescue the guy s finger from the iced tea container. I then went to the counter to ask for iced tea figuring they had some by the drive through  and considering the circumstances  they would be willing to at least pour me a cup.  The guy asked me if the tea got all over me. Yes  it did. I asked if I could get iced tea from the drive through line. I was told no.  No apology  no tea  no offer of help of any sort... just no.  So I was ignored  and I got drenched with iced tea. There was no apology or even an offer to pour me some from the drive through container  and basically nothing.... I do appreciate the fact an off duty employee saved me from my iced tea shower  and another employee did fill my cup with what she was emptying from the defective container.... but I do think my experience could have been much better.  I threw out my iced tea drenched receipt  so I won t be able to fill out my survey  but I will probably contact corporate because this was ridiculous.  But whoever stuck his finger in the iced tea container should be thanked.  He told me it was the second time today the spout came off  so get that thing fixed 
Taco Bell,33,I have never had a more positive experience at a Taco Bell in my life.  Tone was so helpful and nice  we had a car full of complicated orders and everything was executed perfectly   10 10
Taco Bell,34,Very good taco bell compared to most. Never had any major issues with the online ordering  I have had issue before but we re quickly taken care of and with no hassle. Would recommend this one 100  over the one on pecan st.
Taco Bell,35,This location is like a mini Taco Bell.  The interior is kind of small and mostly stools and counters.  The entrance is kind of a cluster to get in and out of  like most things in this area of Parmer .  The staff was friendly enough.  The food is what you expect from Taco Bell.
Taco Bell,36,I gotta say this Location has never disappointed me until tonight there was only 3 cars in front me by the time I got my food it was almost 20 minutes I noticed when I first pulled up after ordering I noticed three of the employees goofing around in the back I won t be back at night anymore
Taco Bell,37,This is the worst Taco Bell. We were so excited when this location opened so close to our house  yet because of their horrendous service  i.e. No service  we go to other locations  much further away. Today  I couldn t even purchase gift cards from this location. I was told that their manager is the only one with access...and he she is not here...at lunch time. This is the same manager that asked for prospective employees to come in on a specific day  only to be on vacation. So sad. At least there s another one down the street.
Taco Bell,38,Food was cold. Customer service was horrible. Won t be back    We wanted to place two separate orders  and was told we would have to drive around twice for two orders    Wtf 
Taco Bell,39,Ever single time I have been to this location something is wrong...out of food  closed early  machines down...etc. Don t trust.
Taco Bell,40,This particular Taco Bell location is awful  On two occasions I ve had terrible service. I went one evening through the drive thru about 9pm and I was told that they were closed because no one showed up to work. Really   Then just last week trying again at the drive thru  I m told that there is a 30 minute wait because they are out of beef  when I expressed my disappointment   the person on intercom said that I could substitute steak or chicken so I placed my order for 3 tacos and it was  11. He did not tell me he was going to charge me for the substitute  When I saw that I told him forget it  They really need to get their act together.
Taco Bell,41,It s Taco Bell  so you generally know what to expect. I went through the drive-through with no problem. Everything I ordered was in the bag  with sporks and sauce. Got home and it was tasty enough.
Taco Bell,42,Usually not a bad location...but today was crazy. Went into this TB around 2pm. There were 2 people sleeping in the lobby...customers..laid out..laid across multiple seats. There were 4 back packs in a corner and the lobby was a mess. It looked more like a day care center than a restaurant.  The long unshaven guy at the counter never asked if he could help me nor did he give me the correct change back  until I asked him to recount it. Just not a good day at this TB.
Taco Bell,43,Ok  ok...now I know it s not cool to like big chain fast food. TB always seems to be the butt of many jokes. Drunk food  stoner food  whatever...  The truth is...I like TB. Now  given choice and convenience  I d prefer a little taqueria...but for the price and convenience  I m cool with the Bell.  It takes me all of 5 minutes from house to Bell back to house. Enough grub to satisfy me for under a fiver.   Feel free to judge away...I m sure you have been known to things you are less than proud of. Stand tall. Stand proud. Embrace your vices 
Taco Bell,44,I bought some food today and 2hr later me and the toilet were best buddies for 1 hr  do not buy food from here it will give you the  Burning Shits 
Taco Bell,45,I ve been to this location several times  and it isn t like other Taco Bell s.  The food isn t up to par. Tonight  the bean burritos were on old hard flour tortillas and hardly had any beans.  The nachos were okay  but was missing something. I would suggest avoid this place.
Taco Bell,46,Taco bell on 1548 E. Parmer Ln Austin Tx 78754. I went to taco bell at 5 20 2018 at 12 49 am. I got a number 10 which was 2 crunchy tacos chzy gord crunch and cinnamon twist. The next morning around 8 am I woke up with a headache  diarrhea and vomiting all day. I went to the ER because I couldn t keep nothing down and also was giving a IV for fluids. The doctors ran test and ruled it out to be   Food Poisoning  the doctor sent me home with three different medications. I called the restaurant to let them know an the Manager Alex gave me attitude. I had to miss three days of work and on the third day I was still feeling bad.
Taco Bell,47,I did not get sick. That s about the best i can say for this insipid inauthentic chain restaurant.
Taco Bell,48,I wish I could give this POS place zero stars. We pulled up at 1 43am and these people would not answer the drive-thru  so we pulled up to the window. We waited at the window and attempted to drive back thru. Nothing. Then they waited until time sprang forward at 2am to 3am and they turned the light off in the drive-thru. I will never visit this place again. This is not the first time we have had this type of issue with the lazy employees at this taco bell. Fire your night staff.
Taco Bell,49,8 30pm- been in the drive thru for over 20 mins now. it normally is slow here but holy Chet wtf. save yourself some time and go to the one on west parmer. sometimes they run out of beef
Taco Bell,50,Worst taco bell I ve ever been too. Every single time it takes at least 15 mins to get through a line of 3 cars. Been to this location 3 times and today was the last time. Waste is time.
Taco Bell,51,Rude Staff  Unwilling to help  and food is horrible at this Taco Bell.  I was thrilled that a new Taco Bell was built close to Dessau  amp  Parmer cause I spend  35 to  45 a week on Taco bell and have to drive all the way to Parmer and close to Metric. At least at that location  the staff works hard to be friendly and the food somehow just tastes so much better   I ve been to this new location 5 times and I ve finally had enough and will not go back  Each time they always miss some part of the order. Its always cold  they take forever to get me my food  wait an average 15 to 20 minutes from ordering  and they are rude when you tell them they made a mistake.   The Doritos Locos Taco Supremes are always low on meat and the soft tacos are hard  yes I said hard. The food here just isn t worth the money  I thought all Taco Bells taste the same  nope  Not here. I miss the other Taco bell soft tacos with the meat so hot its so delicious. HERE  its given to you cold  I guess its because I always have big orders  but that s no excuse  I have a big family and spend a lot of money and expect a good warm meal. The other taco bell gets it done  Not here.   Go to another Taco Bell  this place gives you small amounts of meat and isn t hot or even warm. I still do not get how this Taco Bell s taste is not good. I love Taco Bell and all others are so good. Why does this location lack so much with service and taste        Go elsewhere  you ll be ripped off.
Taco Bell,52,5 stars simply because of the person at the drive thru was the most professional and nicest employees ever  Taco Bell in general is a joke when it comes to Mexican food but because of the service this employee gave in less than 3 minutes of interaction it made it all great. Wish I could have a better description but it was a skinny male lol
Taco Bell,53,Very very slow and inconsiderate staff. I don t recommend coming here unless you want to wait an eternity for them to fix your order they most likely will mess up on.
Taco Bell,54,Been here maybe 4 times since moving to this area. Two times it took 20  minutes to get my food and one of the other two times my order was wrong. Possibly the worst Taco Bell ever.
Taco Bell,55,Unbelievably slow. Always a wait. Staff takes forever for simple order. If you re vegetarian  don t bother. They don t understand...I asked to sub beans to my order and they ADDED beans on top of the meat after I said  no meat 
Taco Bell,56,As someone who has an autoimmune disease that limits what I can eat  Taco Bell is actually one of the few fast food restaurants I can go to. I went through the drive-through with my boyfriend at around 11 30 PM. Now  we knew that they were about to close  but the restaurant was not closed therefore they should still have the food that you would like to eat right  Well I was able to get my soft tacos with no problem  however my boyfriend wanted to order nachos and she stated that they did not have any cheese. He then asked for something else with steak  but they were out of that as well. It is so frustrating to us when we go somewhere and they are out of the food or don t want to melt the cheese so that they can make our food. The lady speaking to us was very sarcastic and rude  as we were trying to figure out what we could order that they actually had. At one point she even stated and I quote  we don t have whatever you want  we are about to close.  So rude. Never going back to this location
Taco Bell,57,The place is good  not great but good. I live around the corner  so I go here all the time. The day staff is great  but the night staff is lacking. It is almost like a different Taco Bell  honestly. They are all very nice  but not necessarily fun. If you are trying to have fun and be goofy  they just kind of stare at you. I don t suppose it is their job to be entertaining  but a smile would be cool. Anyway  as a whole this place is pretty good.
Taco Bell,58,This place is horrible  3 times I ve been here and each time they managed to screw up my order in some way. I order a large freeze drink  the girl screws it up and Gave me a regular while charging me a large one and it wasn t even busy. I order a chicken cantina bowl they somehow made a chicken Catina burrito instead. I order a chicken cantina bowl and the guy who made it didn t even add the cheese and the guacamole. I mean come on now  how can you screw up on an order  You have the ingredients and a picture that shows you how to make it. I m never going back here again. This place lack customer service and a Management That can lead his or her team the right path. There has been other times I came in and the staff is busy taking and not even tending to customers.  This store is not going to make it without a leader who knows how to lead.
Taco Bell,59,Tell me why I go around 8 30 pm and order a quesadilla meal so you would assume that these people know how to do their job and know dam well that a quesadilla is hot. Well that wasn t the case after getting home and seeing that the cheese wasn t even melted just pissed me off how are you going to give someone raw food  So you know obviously I went back to the store and politely asked for a refund and for my order to be remade. The manager said he can only do one thing either redo my food or give me my money back since it s against  company policy . I told him no you re gonna make my food again this time hot cause that s not my fault you guys couldnt double check before giving out raw food and you re gonna refund my money. Now I wasn t rude. I didn t cuss or get loud. I got my money and my food after all the dam employees kept looking at me like how about doing your job instead of looking to the lobby to see who s there. So when I m leaving the MANAGER ON DUTY decides to say a smart ass comment as I m walking out and tell everyone in the kitchen loud enough for me to hear on how much he hates his job.  I turned around and told him boy you hate it here so much maybe you should go apply else where. Ghetto  retard  and still wants a better job. Sorry but this place gets 1 star and that s only because Yelp doesn t let me give y all 0 stars. Next time don t waste other people time and maybe we won t have to come back.
Taco Bell,60,Absolutely horrendous customer service  I m still fuming.  I ve worked customer service for nearly a decade now and half of that with fast food.  Yes it was rush hour  no it was not busy  there s no excuse for the level of rudeness from the drive-thru staff.  It was very much a  whatchu want   anything else  experience.  The employee taking my order didn t say  Hi   no  Welcome to Taco Bell  may I take your order   no  how ya doing  nothing.  I had to sit and wait a few seconds in disbelief at the greeting I received  just to make sure I heard it clearly when he called on the speaker again. It gets better  when I got the food  the employee just closed the window and worked on the next order  no have a nice day  nothing.  I was so mad when I left that I didn t even notice til I got home that I was missing a drink from my order.  I called the store for the manager and was told she was  busy  for the next 2 hours.  This place is not worth your time  I ve had some poor experiences  but this one takes the cake.  I ll stick to the Taco Bell on W Parmer from now on  never had a bad experience there.
Los Potrillos,1,Food is delicious. If you want to try true Mexican authentic food this is it. I would def recommend to family and friends.
Los Potrillos,2,I ordered on the phone. I am not native English speaker and they are not either. It was hard to understand each other. They didn t want to deal with it then all of sodden  they hang up the phone. It was very rude.
Los Potrillos,3,I would have given it zero but that s not an option..my Chile relleno was not seared long enough and it was still raw. At first they offered to remake it then the waitress came back and said that s how it s supposed to be. No it s not..I then went to pay and they wouldn t take it off my check because that s how they cook it..never go here.
Los Potrillos,4,The food is authentic Mexican  not your average tex mex. The food has always been consistently served well   no major complaints. Their drink menu has a unique variety of drinks and they are reasonably priced. The place is great  but just note that things there get done like they do back in Mexico. They re not going to turn down the music just because you request it... they have a unique character and you either like it or you just need to move on. One highlight of the place is Karaoke during the weekend nights ... this is great and entertaining  the dj is awesome and keeps things moving along smoothly.. its mainly Spanish songs that get requested but they have a good selection of songs in English too
Los Potrillos,5,Wow  The food is great  The place is so clean and y all about fast service. The place is a little cozy  but this won t stop us from coming back. One of the best in town I ve had. Highly recommend 
Los Potrillos,6,We decided to take a chance and try this place last night. We were not disappointed. We were a little concerned when we went inside and there was an armed security guard inside the front door  though.  The salsa was a refreshing change from the norm. They brought a fire roasted red salsa  a green salsa  that they warned was hot   and a plain mild tomato sauce in a small carafe. We each got our own little bowls so we could mix some of the mild sauce with the salsas if they were too spicy. This is a great idea and especially nice for my partner who is not a fan of anything too spicy hot.  I had a pork carnita taco and a grilled chicken gordita  my partner had the enchilada  amp  taco combo plate  and our teen had the fajita nachos. We all enjoyed our meal and will definitely go back.
Los Potrillos,7,The restaurant is surrounded by  hourly  motels  but don t let that scare you away.  This is a fun place with great food.  They have 2 types of salsa that you can mix to make it as spicy as you want  the refried beans and rice are full of flavor.  Have had their nachos- they give you a huge amount  enchiladas- beef and cheese  tacos- crispy and soft  corn and flour and beef and carnitas  and burritos.  All were delicious and full of flavor.    They have karaoke- in spanish  and although it s loud at times  it s definitely fun.
Los Potrillos,8,The wait staff is very unprofessional and condescending. My friends order came back wrong and when we told the waiter he said we would have to pay for a second plate  even though they messed it up in the first place. The chips are tasteless and stale and the queso tasted like it was microwaved. The rice tasted reheated and overall the dishes lacked Mexican authenticity. Very upsetting. Would not go back.
Los Potrillos,9,It seems like a family oriented place. It gets super packed and it takes them a while to get your order in. The waitress was rude and instead of fixing the issue she wanted to charge me for both entrees.  The food is authentic but the rudeness and the time you have to wait to eat sucks. I would not want to try this place again.     Se tardan mucho para atenderte y ademas la mesera se molestan cuando les dices que no es la comida exacta y me la querian cobrar como quiera. La comida si es autentica pero el maltrato y el tiempo que se tardan para traerte tu comida es fastidioso. No me gustaria regresar.
Los Potrillos,10,Our group of 5 had the polar opposite experience to the reviewer slamming the service.  We went for a late breakfast around 11 00  had a delightful waitress who served our food in no time.  This isn t TexMex  but authentic Mexican.  I m not an expert but from my travels throughMexico  I d base the style in Mexico City or West of there.
Los Potrillos,11,The food was ok  but the music was extremely loud  It was hard to keep a conversation at that place without yelling to each other. We requested to our waitress if they can turn down the volume of the music a little bit down  but she said   This is the way they keep the music in here   Horrible music btw 
Los Potrillos,12,Great Food and Excellent service  my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin. I have been a regular for more than four years and they have always been consistent with and quality of their food and service
Los Potrillos,13,This place deserves a ZERO    When I walked in there s literally someone guarding the door like you have to push the door open for him to notice you pretty wierd... The place  Is very crowded literally not much space between other tables if you have babies you will literally have to tuck them in under the table that s how reduced the place is and what we had to do with our babies.When I spoke to the person who was going to show us to our table he looked like I had no what I was saying to him note that I spoke in  English and Spanish to him.All the waitresses looked very distracted and also rude for  example our waitress was taking our order and another waitress yelled at her to tell her something not work wise and she ignored what we were asking her. She messed up our order we asked for the parrillada cavern cola for 2 people and only brought one small parrillada she kept looking over at our table I m guessing to see if we would eat what she had served me and when we called her over to tell her there s been a mistake with what we order she said there s not much difference between the individual parrillada and the one for 2 we asked her to bring us the one for 2 and trust me it was huge difference and then she just didn t show up at all we had to call out to other waiters.We also got a Mexican martini which was not good the food we order was very good. The music they were playing was corridos and Norte as and it was really loud they also had karaoke. All in all I would not go to this place EVER again.
Los Potrillos,14,While visiting Austin  we stopped by. Turns out they have extremely loud karaoke. The food was subpar at best. The chips tasted like they came out of a bag. Completely tasteless. Our dinners were much better. I had hoped for so much more in a Mexican restaurant in Texas.
Los Potrillos,15,I used to pass this place and never really cared to go try it  mainly because of the location. When I decided to try it I was astonished by the taste and the variety in their food. I absolutely love the molcajete Azteca  the meats  beef fajita  chicken fajita  sausage and shrimp  are all well cooked and come in chipotle sauce with onions  cactus and jalapenos. They also come accompanied with a side of rice  charro beans  guacamole  pico and sour cream. This is all to much food for me so I get to share with my hubby. The price is fair for the meals. Most of the servers are attentive and friendly. It is a karaoke bar  which can sometimes be fun but not when you are trying to have a good conversation since the music is very loud. In those cases I recommend you go in the daytime or during weekdays.
Los Potrillos,16,Small but good portions.  Food was served fast  good margarita.  Enchiladas supreme did not come with rice and beans.  Would go back  but not in best location.
Los Potrillos,17,this is not your  americanized tex mex restaurant folks.  awesome  authentic mexican food here. i am personally a fan of their fish ceviche. must be that hispanic side of me but its very flavorful  very very yummy. the fajitas are also an A plus.  you really cant go wrong here as long as you are prepared for real hardcore ethnic mexican food.  pretty fairly priced as well.  thursday-sunday is karaoke night. lemme just say i stumbled in one night around midnight and was greeted but a full swing congo line and very active  tipsy restaurant full of people. the vibe was contagious.  i really really enjoy this place.
Los Potrillos,18,I hate this place I live right by here and have only been in austin a few months and love Mexican food so I come here often but the staff is always so rude I could care less about how the food tastes I ve spoken to the manager and even reported them to the department of better business
Los Potrillos,19,Los Potrillos opened a few months ago and is a terrific addition to Austin s restaurant scene.    The decor is Northern-Mexican ranch-style with good-quality polished wooden seating.  The owners invested quite a bit into the interior for a pleasant dining environment.  I ve eaten the chicken fajitas as well as some burrito lunches and each time the food was excellent.  The fajitas come out sizzling in a generous portion and the burritos are BIG.  Veggies and salads are always fresh and tasty.  Lunch specials are definitely affordable and dinners are reasonable.  They have karaoke  en espa ol  on Friday and Saturday nights and on Sunday during the day.  It s loud but fun   Si Ud. puede cantar en espanol -  unirse al karaoke 
Los Potrillos,20,The food is good. Nothing fancy or out of this world. Good is enough. I have been there several times to watch a soccer match. They are very friendly and nice. Always order a Jamaica to drink. They have this very Mexican options. Most of the Mexican restaurants doesn t have Jamaica or Orchata. Fajitas are really good. Good staff.
Los Potrillos,21,I pass this place every day on my way to work  so one day I thought I d give it try for lunch. The food was so good  I went again that very same day for dinner  bringing a friend along. I ve since been back a few times and I m still highly impressed  delicious affordable food  prompt service  clean and welcoming environment. If anything was true in the previous negative reviews of this place  these guys have since improved on it. If I have to mention one gripe  it would be the karaoke being quite loud when my friend and I dined the evening mentioned above. But it s karaoke  what are ya gonna do  Best hole-in-the-wall Mexican food place I ve ever tried in Austin.
Los Potrillos,22,We arrived and should have listened to our gut feeling and stayed in the car.  There were broken bottles all over the place.  The salsa was room temperature and disgusting.  My partner said he had the worst barbacoa taco ever.  The only thing that was even slightly worth eating was the baked potato.
Palomino's Food Truck,1,Great Food from a Great Family   Ate there last Night. Parked at Maverick s Dance Club in Buda  Tx
Palomino's Food Truck,2,Y all  This food truck is outside of Mavericks and they re SO gOod   Their fajitas are delicious and their salsas...amazing  
Palomino's Food Truck,3,Really enjoyed the food and service. We ate several tamales and tacos and everything was amazing.
Big Boss Foods,1,you know  life is SHORT. do you really have time to NOT eat these tacos  THIS food is worth the most precious resource you have. TIME. think about it.  p.s. the tots were sick also.
Big Boss Foods,2,This place shares tables with Regal Ravioli.  They just opened last week.  While I waiting for my raviolis I was eyeing the menu which leans heavily on Bacon and I had to try the Big Boss   7 - 2  12 .  The Big Boss is a Bacon Wrapped Onion Ring  stuffed with seasoned meat and a little bit of cheese.  The closest comparison I can think of is the most delicious sausage you ve ever had.  I ve had Bosnian meat in Boise that was similar.  The tacos also looked delicious  and had a bacon and meat theme - though I only tried the Big Boss.  Looking forward to going  back soon.
Big Boss Foods,3,Bacon-cheese tots are out of this world  The staff is incredibly friendly  and involved in the community. For a good time get a Boss Ring
Taqueria Jefes,1,One of my go-to Taco trucks. I always get the Tacos de Bistek  beef tacos   and they re always amazing. There s been one or two times where they came out just O.K. but most of the time  they re excellent. Prices are good and staff is friendly.  I always recommend them to friends.
Taqueria Jefes,2,Love this place  It s right off the highway so it s a quick stop on the way home after a long day. All the ladies that work there are super nice. The tacos are wonderful 
Taqueria Jefes,3,The food was overall bland. No seasoning on the meat. The salsa wasn t good either. Staff was friendly though.
Taqueria Jefes,4,Came here during the night shift .  I can forgive bad food but definitely not bad attitudes. Ordered the burrito with carne asada. The meat was super dry and for how long it took for them to make it   it s just not worth it. Best bet is to go to the Whataburger across the street.
Taqueria Jefes,5,The tortas sucked.. Im usually not picky at all especially not if i m hungry. The bread was hard af  amp  the meat felt super hard too.
Taqueria Jefes,6,Well night shift likes to creat their own prices. I over heard another black woman surprised at the price of her tacos  the other day she. I was sitting out side. Saying that she paid 12  for the same order the night before. I laughed at her and told her she must have gone somewhere else because no way she pairs that. She insisted it was here jefes catering service trailer on 290 in front of the spin zone. I assumed she had been drunk and just mistaken. I come here every week. Sometimes multiple times but always during the day. Tonight I had to was close later than normal so I walked over to my faithful truck. I got the same thing that I always do. It s 5  and I ALWAYS tip  She decided to charge me 6  for 2 -2  tacos. Honey if your going to charge me the tip I m not going to give you one on top of it... THEN the girls where rude. Rolling their eyes and talking shit because I didn t tip. Its also bad business to make assumptions that people don t speak or understand Spanish.
Taqueria Jefes,7,This place sucks. I went there tonight and order tripa tacos and they gave me something i didnt even know what it was. It was very disappointing. I will not be returning ever. There was lack of effort  communication. The girl who was cooking had her hair down. Very unprofessional.
Taqueria Jefes,8,Woah. Just woah. I ve lived near this place for a year and never thought twice about eating here. However a friend suggested we give it a try tonight. We ordered two al pastor on corn and two barbacoa on flour. The al pastor was a little too crispy for my taste  but the barbacoa was INCREDIBLE. We ordered two more. Our friend ordered  The gringa  with bistec  beef fajita more or less  and holy woah  I was blown away. It s basically a fried layer of cheese with fajita and onions and cilantro. This place is incredible. Give it a try 
Taqueria Jefes,9,Ok tacos. Meat was a bit dry. Got the bistek taco and a little over cooked. Lean portions for  2 a taco. I ve been to other taco trucks where tacos are stuffed for  1.50.
Taqueria Jefes,10,Cash only. Basic Mexican trailer food. They do have menudo. Prices are fair  service is quick. Staff is nice. Food is average ok. I had no problems with my food. I had a torta cubana and it was mixed meat. not bad.
Taqueria Jefes,11,I am the first English review for this little taco truck  That speaks volumes alone. I drive by almost everyday and there are always lots of people and their kids. From what I can tell it is also open very late. I ve never stopped because it is in a parking lot next to Arlan s Market and thus not very tempting. So when I had to get a tire patched recently  I tried the breakfast tacos. Soft tortillas  good chorizo  tasty refried beans. And spicy green sauce and smoky red... I ll be back 
Taqueria Jefes,12,I expected a lot more of this place. I can only speak about the tacos because that s the only thing I ordered. The flavor is good but the amount of meat they put in them is not enough  it s like eating tortillas with only flavor meat not the actual meat. They would ve been OK if the price was lower  but it s ridiculous  2 for each taco that is mainly tortilla with barely something in it. I ve been to better places that put more meat in the tacos and the price is around  1.60  believe me- it does make a difference 
Taco Bell,1,I went for breakfast and though I love the food I can be reluctant to go to Taco Bell s for breakfast because other locations are usually out of things or don t know their own breakfast menu very well. Whoever was on drive thru this morning was super helpful and friendly and my food was out fast. Great job guys  
Taco Bell,2,I simply asked for a vegan crunchwrap supreme with no cheese  no meat  only rice  beans  lettuce  and tomatoes.   I told the guy three times no meat.   He continues to ask do you want beef    Was he stupid or just hard of hearing       He asks me what sauces  I say hot. He doesn t give me any sauces.  I didn t receive a receipt.   The crunchwrap supreme has cheese on it. And now I can t eat it. Wasted  5 due to this guy s carelessness and ignorance.   I d avoid this Taco Bell at all costs if I d were you.
Taco Bell,3,We waited in the drive-thru for 20 minutes  then got to the order box and they said they were now closed. Then......we were stuck in line to wait for the cars in front of us that did get orders. Waited another 20 minutes because we were trapped in line. Unbelievable experience.   Unreal.
Taco Bell,4,This is my first review ever. And Its in hopes that no one else has to experience wasting their money here on food that will have to go straight to the trash.  Yesterday night we got some tacos. 2 boxes and they were all rancid   I understand this is not a 5 star restaurant but all food establishments should have the decency to serve edible food.  Management please do your job and make sure expired products are thrown out and cooking oil gets changed.
Taco Bell,5,If you want to wait 40 minutes in a drive thru for a single item this is the place for you
Taco Bell,6,Tried ordering online a few times - stuff was missed the first day but I thought maybe it was just one bad day. It wasn t.  I ve ordered delivery from this location three or four times now and I m always missing things from sauce packets to extra sauce on my entree to entire drinks. I m unsure if there s a standardized amount of meat that goes in each item but I feel shorted on things like steak when I order from here.  Generally frustrating.
Taco Bell,7,I ll always support Taco Bell. They re a major chain for a reason. But I sat in this drive thru for 40 minutes..... That s way too long for how fast the food is. There were about ten cars ahead of me and it was moving pretty quickly  then when I got to the intercom to order  I waited 15 minutes for someone to ask my order. And unfortunately it s drive thru is one of the ones you can t  escape  and it s blocked in by curbs and grass. I finally get to the window to get my food and I hear the cashier cussing at who may have been a customer yelling  WE HAVE STEAK OR CHICKEN TAKE YOUR F CKING PICK.  Not to mention the woman in front of me didn t get her full order  so she walked back to the window  knocking for 3 mins before she was even noticed. Only reason they re getting more than one star is because my order was right  and it tasted how it should have. Otherwise a pretty bad experience.
Taco Bell,8,I can t believe I m reviewing a Taco Bell but I just have to. They are always SO kind and cool at this location. Very friendly  accommodating and sweet to my pup. We went just now and my boyfriend accidentally dropped his card during the hand off. My boyfriend put the car in park and began to open the door to go grab it  but before he even could the employee reached all of the way out of the window to get it for him. I have worked in many customer service jobs and it s so easy to get jaded  but everyone here is always friendly.
Taco Bell,9,Usually passes as a Taco Bell but since the beginning of the month  2 out of the last 3 times I ve gone I ve been told the  system was down and it d be a 20-30 minute wait.   Keep in mind both of the times I heard that was at around 11 30 pm and today and 10 30 pm  close at 1am .  Odd how frequently the system goes down here  always at night  and the guy also knows when the system will come back on.   Edit  changed to a one star because guess what 2 more times I ve gone and their  system is down   After a long ass double on a Saturday sometimes I just wanna pick up a few tacos. I get you just want to clean and go home but there s still an hour left of business and this is always the excuse. Now they don t pay me the big bucks to run a restaurant  but if they did  I d recommend.. idk.. getting a new system 
Taco Bell,10,Time and time again ... this is theee BEST Taco Bell experience  Y all crush the customer service and the timeliness  Keep doing what you re doing  
Taco Bell,11,Absolutely horrible    I mean obviously we know Taco Bell is on a high class restaurant but what I encountered in this particular location was beyond bad    The service is horrible  Workers are super rude  The restaurant itself was dirty  I don t know when was the last time they cleaned it  and the food.....well  let me say this.... I won t even feed them to the dogs   STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION   
Taco Bell,12,I want to share my appreciation for the staff.  I came by during a Friday night  and the drive thru was really backed up. When I pulled up to the cashier  the employee seemed stressed. We had a quick conversation while she was running my payment.  The team was two people short  and they were working frantically to fulfill all the orders. The young woman was polite and kept her composure while getting my order ready.  I don t think these people get enough appreciation for getting through unexpected circumstances. Thank you 
Taco Bell,13,This is the closest Taco Bell near my work  so I go here often. The past few times  they have messed up my order and I tried to be nice and let it slide. I called up there to speak with a manager and no one picked up  answer machine was full  so I called a few times more AND THEY TURNED THE PHONE OFF    They have messed up my coworkers orders as well. They often forget extras on the tacos  which cost extra   forget to switch the protein to an extra paid one  fail to put a sufficient amount of potatoes on the potato taco  the past three times I ve gone there  I ve gotten 3-4 very small  burnt  sad potatoes . Their employees are rude  neglectful of the front counter  always on their personal phones and always seem stressed and unhappy. The physical appearance is unkept and the bathroom is often times nasty.   Not good Taco Bell  not good.
Taco Bell,14,I hate driving down Cameron road  but occasionally it s worth it for a quick stop at Taco Bell s drive-thru.  It s not somewhere I go all the time  but I ve probably stopped here about once a month ever since I moved into the neighborhood several years ago.  And all but one of those times  the service has been excellent.  Though I ve gone inside a couple of times  I mostly just go through the drive thru and then eat when I get home 3 minutes later.  They ve never messed up my order  even though I always stray from the basic menu  asking for extra this and none of that.  The only thing they sometimes get wrong is the number of hot sauce packets I need  probably because I ask for about twice as many as most people would use.  But I keep a bottle of their hot sauce from HEB at home anyway  so it s not a big issue.    The people working the drive-thru are always pleasant -- they re even extra sweet to my old dog  who s often hanging her giant head out the backseat window.  Sometimes their drive-thru line is a little long  so there s a bit of a wait  but I can t really complain about that  since they re clearly working as fast as they can.  There was only one time the wait was unbearably long  and I m not sure what was going on.  But when I got up to the window to pay  the manager popped into view and gave me a 100  discount  so I got my food for free.  I hadn t even complained or been unpleasant about it  all I d done was hand over my credit card.  But she just said I d had to wait too long  cleared the total from the register  and I didn t need to pay.  Now that s amazing service 
Taco Bell,15,First negative Taco Bell experience. Our regular Taco Bell location was closed to we drove an extra 15 minutes for Taco Bell. Service staff were really nice but half the food I paId for isn t in my bag. Extremely disappointed. Wish I could get my money back  OH  and the crispy tacos were soggy and THERE WAS NO CHICKEN IN THE CHICKEN QUESADILLA. Worst Taco Bell experience ever.
Taco Bell,16,A very hilarious Taco Bell where they will flat out lie to you and tell you they are out of food when they re not and they just don t wanna serve you.
Taco Bell,17,Well... when did Taco Bell change their menu  They didn t have at least half of what we wanted.  We came in 20 minutes before closing but still heard them tell a customer they were closed. Make TACO BELL GREAT AGAIN.
Taco Bell,18,Literally the worst Taco Bell ever. I used to frequent this location all the time but recently stopped coming. My last visit they overcharged me by  7.21 because they gave me my order and someone else s order after waiting in the drive thru for over 30 minutes and my order was still wrong  The lady working the drive thru doesn t understand anything  special requests  even though she s worked there forever. Never again.
Taco Bell,19,It s Taco Bell...at it s worst. Unfriendly and aggressive. The ingredients are old and stale tasting. Cheese in quesadilla not completely melted  Chalupa bread cold  old not heated up..etc..pretty pretty bad...
Taco Bell,20,At the drive-thru late and order two special menu items   oh we don t sell those.  Sign is still up  okay then  recalibrate order.  We are out of beef  chips and shredded chicken.  So like your entire menu  Was here once before and they were out of flour tortillas. How is that even possible 
Taco Bell,21,Took 55 mins to get our order. Didn t even get a sorry for your wait. Then our order was wrong..... We stayed patient and waited it out  but man they have some horrible customer service.
Taco Bell,22,This has more to do with the staff  and not the food. Around closing time  someone comes into building  and starts shouting at the crew  and called out a tall Hispanic with tattoos on his arms about respect. The guy who walked in was shouting at the staff in prison terms. The staff handled it very well  and calmed down the situation.   I ordered 2 bean burritos there  and was entertained. The bean burritos came out good.
Taco Bell,23,The service was ok and the food was ok. My main issue was to hear the manager berate his employee s  while customers were still dining. I have been a Supervisor and know that employees may not always be fully capable  yet common decency is not embarrass employee s  in front of each other or the public. We are all human beings that are adults whom should all share common respect towards one another.
Taco Bell,24,Some of the people working here couldn t give a damn and it s a bummer. I know from personal working experience that these kinds of employees make working difficult for other employees that actually try and deserve better.  Management should know better than to provide no support for every employee. If an employee is falling behind  it s your job to support them. It probably  definitely  goes higher than store management itself  so if you re the district manager reading this  get it together. Your employees shouldn t be falling behind like this and it s all on you.
Taco Bell,25,I just had the worst  fast food  experience ever at this Taco Bell location. We ordered at 11 20. My friends got their food 20 minutes later. As I watched them eat  still no food for me. At 12 00 after my friends had finished eating  I finally asked for a refund  with my food nowhere in sight. The manager that processed my refund was extremely rude and seemed put out that I was disappointed. I tried to give her the change that I had received so the I could get back my  6 without coins and she said  without even looking me in the eye   I don t want that   and proceeded to give me even more change. No apology  no nothing. Needless to say  I will not be back. Taco Bell might as well just close this location or hire all new staff. I ve never had an issue like this at any Taco Bell.
Taco Bell,26,I ve never written a yelp review. I specifically downloaded the app and created an acct just to come here and say that this Taco Bell is fucking bullshit. Went through the drive thru for two items  a fresco style crunch wrap and Doritos locos taco.   This is what I got. Shittily made. Barely any meat. The meat on the locos taco was so liquid-y  that the taco fell apart like you see in the pic. It made the tortilla soggy.    6 for this shit. This location needs to get their shit together. Retrain their staff or something. Very very upset customer.
Taco Bell,27,Worst customer service  out of stuff half the time  long lines. Food is ugly and tastes bad
Taco Bell,28,Staff has Horrible customer service and ghetto to the max. Made my  food sloppy took back in for a refund and all them started talking hot at the mouth. It s none of your concern if I wasn t talking to you. The manager came and refunded me back my money. Lost me
Taco Bell,29,Big Taco Bell fan but this is the most incredible drive thru experience of my life. Got the veggie crunch wrap supreme and Doritos locos and have never tasted flavor like this before. Truly amazing. Will drive out of my way to hit up this TB again.
Taco Bell,30,Taco Bell is Taco Bell.  Duh.  I ll just throw out some observations for you.    .  The drive thru line can be ridiculously long.   2.  Inside is hardly ever busy.   3.  People are lazy and don t want to leave their cars  even if nobody s inside.   4.  People are weird.   5.  Sometimes the food takes a while.  6.  Sometimes it doesn t.   7.  75  of the people that work here  that I ve dealt with  are super nice  8.  I like nice people.
Taco Bell,31,Just moved to the area  glad to see that 4th meal was an option for me. Long drive wait after normal Business hours but that s expected  I can deal with that   but the food has been perfect  when I order bean w cheese burritos 86 the onions and red sauce extra cheese it s always perfection for me. Keep it up
Taco Bell,32,I use to love going to this location. So I decided to go yesterday. I ordered a Nacho Fries Bell Grande and 2 supreme tacos. This is the 1st time the fries were cold. Couldn t finish it. Then I opened one supreme taco  barely anything in it  the other was full but was missing the shedded cheese. So I took it back to the counter and asked them to remake it. The cashier who was very sweet informed the guy who prepared it and he said   portion control.  I understand portion control but that was more like toddler portion control. Never received the tacos so I paid for 2 supreme tacos without having it fixed. They pretty much stole from me. I went to the cashier and she gave me 2 large skittle slushies. The old crew is who I loved. They weren t greedy. This new crew just don t care minus the cashier.
Taco Bell,33,Ok. So I m giving it 4 stars based on the fact that it s taco bell and I m comparing it to other taco bells. This isn t a fancy establishment  there are no bells besides in the name  and whistles. With fast food I have little expectations other than fast and accurate service and pray the food is  decent . So with that said. This location meets expectations.  The drive thru line IS long -go inside if your in a rush  the orders are 98  accurate which is pretty good considering everyone s been  screwed thru the drive thru  BUT THE STAFF  THIS IS WHY I BOTHERED TO YELP A FREAKING TACO BELL  the staff is always super nice. Chatty  funny  whitty  apologizing for a wait  if any  and they seem to actually enjoy their job. Which  I mean ....   The food is mediocre  but it s taco bell. But if its late night and the feelings right  stop by this location for a little taco burrito action and meet the staff.
Taco Bell,34,I m not afraid to give a fast food place 5 stars but this wasn t it.  Food was good and the employees were nice.  Service was really slow  they were out of chicken  amp  all fountain drinks at lunch hour  I m not even dinging them for that since I didn t order that but they told others   and they call customers  guests  which loses a point right there.
Taco Bell,35,These guys are complete liars. I asked for bean and cheese burritos and they said they were out. How are you out of refried beans  And how are you that unprepared  This store should be shut down solely based on the laziness of their employees not wanting to serve.
Taco Bell,36,Food would ve been fine  but it was accompanied by a gross side of sexual harassment. The man working the drive thru Saturday night kept making unwanted  disgusting advances on my sister and myself. We left feeling unsafe and gross. Wouldn t recommend going here whatsoever.
Taco Bell,37,Each time I ve gone my order has been wrong. They re all extremely rude and they close an hour early most nights but stay in the store until they re suppose to leave. They say there registers are down as an excuse to close early but it s every time.
Taco Bell,38,Horrible customer service. We waited 15 minutes at the speaker box to order and nobody still didn t attended us    On top of that when we get to the window we have the cashier get the manager to tell us that he could not attend us at the speaker box because the system was down so  we asked if we could order at the window. The manager kept making excuses refusing to attend us. I would not recommend this Taco Bell at this location to nobody.
Taco Bell,39,I have been to this location one other time before it every time I come the line is so long and the person at the drive-thru window is always very short and doesn t sound very pleasant on the other end. They d have terrible customer service skills. They just handle your card and your food and your receipt and they just closed the window. Don t even say anything. I will definitely not be coming back to this location again if I have to wait a long time for food to come out. This location could do a lot better
Taco Bell,40,Any kind of burrito you order from here will fall apart on you instantly because they don t know how to wrap it.  Be sure it get a fork with your order.  Avoid any food item with potatoes in it. What you get is really old rock hard chucks of potato.  I used one of the potato junks to stabilize my desk at work.  Seems be holding the weight and working just fine.
Taco Bell,41,Just went to Taco Bell and was told that they were closed for the night with hours online show that they are open to 3 AM and their lights are still on. If you were close why do you show that you are still open and why are you advertise that you are still open. Been to this establishment many times before And have had many orders messed up so to show up and to be told opened and to be told closed is very unprofessional. Seems like the staff does not want to work.
Taco Bell,42,This place sucks drive thru bad attitude never going back to this location i use to like it here but never again
Taco Bell,43,Good for late night munchies... but still really gross. I am a vegetarian and they had ground beef all over their line that looked like it d been there awhile as it was hard. I had to say something so my food wouldn t touch it and the manager cleaned it up. I am concerned that such a mess is normal here and honestly it s just a wreck of a restaurant kept unclean and disorganized.
Taco Bell,44,They never get my order right. I ask foe extra cheese on my taco s. And I never get extra cheese and they still charge me for it.  Tonight I got 6 taco s ask for extra cheese didn t get it but got charged   2.70 for extra cheese I didn t get. And when I called to complain no answer. I called 4 times. It rang til it hung up. I strongly suggest that your team and management get things together. Basically you re stealing my money everytime that I go. You charge for extra cheese and yet don t give extra cheese. And sometimes there s hardly any cheese in the Taco at all come on really cheese in this is  essential to make a taco come together. If you don t get your act together you will lose a very good customer.
Taco Bell,45,Ricky and Mike were very accommodating despite having my complicated order. They were having computer problems and Ricky was calm and reassuring me that he is trying his best. And since I had waited for a while they compensated me for my time with some complimentary tacos. I was going for a late night munch so I cannot speak for other times and other workers.
Taco Bell,46,They said they closed at 1am. I showed up at 12 50am and they would not serve me. Not keeping the time advertised. I m disappointed.
Taco Bell,47,While the food is fairly good  the service leaves a lot to be desired. I called today because the online ordering system kept telling me that my perfectly good credit card was declined. My first question to the girl who answered was whether they accepted call-in orders. She rudely retorted  No   and hung up before I could explain that there was something wrong with their website. I m seriously ticked 
Taco Bell,48,I ordered a crunchy taco  at noon mind you  which came out flat as a pancake with barely any meat in it and no lettuce. The cheese was already melted  the shell was split down the middle and felt stale  and it wasn t even lukewarm. Just gross.
Taco Bell,49,Two words  HELL YEAH  The only thing more satisfying than a beefy chalupa after a long day at work is the Hell Yeah Hallelujah Choir manning this fine establishment. Cameron Road Taco Bell  your Doritos Locos Tacos fill my stomach and your Hell Yeahs fill my heart.  And your Fiesta Potatoes fill my arteries. I probably shouldn t eat any more of those.
Taco Bell,50,Fast service. Friendly service. Doritos loco tacos. Baja blast. Nuff said. Oh and the really njce lady called me baby. Loved it.
Taco Bell,51,Website says open until 3am. Wouldn t take my order at 1 45am  all lights were shut off and drive-thru didn t respond to my requests. Horrible customer service according to their orders of operation.
Taco Bell,52,It s true  this place does suck. Been here multiple times and I freaken love Taco Bell  but it took an insane amount of time in the drive through and no one was inside and no one was behind me. I only ordered three little things. That blows. To top it off  they forgot to give me the hot sauce I requested  Lame to the max.
Taco Bell,53,Size of everything went down and the price of everything went up. Join the ranks of Dairy Queen on manor. See you in the trailer park dawg. Seriously  used to be like  I want this and that and this  and spend  6 like a Taco Bell champion. You ve sent me spiraling back to rookie year with your jacked up menu. Love y all but come on. And your breakfast looks like McDonald s came over and crashed and made breakfast for everyone the next morning. Booooooo.
Taco Bell,54,I have lived in this neighborhood for over three years and this is the closest Taco Bell in the area. I would willing drive 10  miles out of my way to avoid this place. The last few times I ve driven through here there was not a single time they didn t mess up my order  sometimes to the point it s inedible. Everyone at this place needs to be fired.
Taco Bell,55,Had an issue where I was double charged due to a glitch in their computer system back in late March. The managers at this location were very friendly and went out of their way to accommodate me for my double charge. Great managers here 
Taco Bell,56,This is a taco bell I am aware  but this is a five-star taco-bell. Whoever that guy with the gingham shirt working the drive-thru from 12 30-12 45am on the 25th was super patient with us absolutely brain-dead college students. Like we were horrible customers  I just wanted to say thank you for bearing with us and I hope that man is recognized for his endurance.
Taco Bell,57,We pulled up at 10 30 pm and were told they were out of food. Not out of something specific. Just that they were out of food  generically  and that they were closed for 30 minutes. How does this even happen 
Taco Bell,58,This is by far theeee worst Taco bell that I have ever been too... well first of all I waited in line for over 15 min..then when I finnaly get to the window the lady with the short afro did not even acknowledge me.. I then waited ther for another 5 min while she was looking stupid staring into space then all of the sudden she had the audacity to take a personal phone call AT THE WINDOW   with her black android phone. the lady that was at another station seen how rude and unattentive the afro lady was so she politely came over and apologized for her co workers behavior and gave me my food... I spent over 20 min in line on my lunch break then I was late to work because of this this incident happened at approximately 9 20pm November 30th 2016 ugghhh..this afro chick needs to be fired or she needs to be written up.. this is unacceptable... she does not want to work she thinks this is a game   if no one is in the hospital or died she had NO business handling a personal call at the window..Thats all
Taco Bell,59,worst ever bad service and the guy making my food through the garbage out in the dumpster and didn t wash his hand before he started making food...
Taco Bell,60,So I ve been going to this sub-par Taco Bell for the past year only because it s the only one close to our new house. I m a Taco Bell fanatic  as lame as that may be  and I ve dealt with this locations idiot employees for as long as I can take. I have finally been been pushed to my absolute limit with these elementary school dropouts. I can t even begin to count the number of times I have checked my order before I leave and consistently find something missing. After my most recent trip I finally have to say something. Ordering  26 worth or food and asking for sauce I m met by a rude  and stoned  looking girl at the window who refuses to give me more than 6 packets of sauce due to them being low for the night. I try to explain how this is not my problem and I still require sauce for my food. She then refuses  to give me any more. I park my car and walk inside to again be greeted by this rude employee only to be told again that she cannot provide me with any more sauce. I ask for a manager who very reluctantly hands me 3 more packets. I ask for more and she looks at me like I m trying to steal her first born child. After a very aggravating exchange  I leave with a total of 8 packets only to find I was so frustrated with this whole ordeal I forgot to count my items and I m missing 2 tacos. This is by far the WORST Taco Bell on this great big blue planet. I will gladly drive any distance or favor my T-Bell from another location before going back to this shit hole.
