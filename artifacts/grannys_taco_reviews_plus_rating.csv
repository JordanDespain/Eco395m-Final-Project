Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,1,"I came for breakfast tacos, and they were amazing. Warm, delicious, comforting, with excellent sauces. They have a variety of excellent tacos but my favorite ended up being just potato, chorizo, and cheese. We also tried the Ranchero Taco and the Alambre Taco and they were both unique and delicious. <br/><br/>My only small complaint is when you add egg to a taco, I think they add a bit too much and it can overwhelm everything else and also be too filling.<br/><br/>I recommend grabbing coffee beforehand from Revival!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,2,"Great tacos! Nice size! Great taste! <br/><br/>The wait wasn't bad when I got there. There was a family in front of me that didn't know what to order so that took 10 minutes for them to decide. Please know what you want before you step to the front.<br/><br/>Lady taking orders looked annoyed at folks that didn't know the basics, like salsa. ""What salsa do you have?"" Sign is up front bud. And guess what? Usually it's red or green. <br/><br/>After ordering, it did take some time to get the food, but I didn't mind. Probably 20 minutes for 4 tacos, but probably because that family in front ordered a lot. <br/><br/>Will be back.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,3,"One of my favorite breakfast tacos ever! It's quick service, has a good amount of outdoor seating, and absolutely delicious food. <br/><br/>I got the Machaca Taco and devoured all of it. It was packed with flavor and filling for a morning bite!<br/><br/>Highly recommend stopping by one of their two locations.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,4,"Decided to try Granys Tacos, went on weekday morning, so not much crowded, Ordered chips with guacamole and salsa, Migas, shrimp taco and Rico taco.<br/>Loved the chips, they were thick and nice, not like thin, the one you get it in supermarkets.<br/>Migas and shrimp were good, my son absolutely love mole sauce, so obviously he got Rico taco, but he said it's too dry and more than that, way way too salty, so dint wanted to eat after a bite, hubby took a tiny bite and confirmed it, so that was absolute waste.<br/>Guy at the truck was good, if you're in the area, give it a try !!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,5,"Reminds me of the food my nanny used to make in Mexico City: Comforting, very homemade stewed meats served up with tortillas. Greasy. Warm. Seasoned with the knowledge and wisdom of her ancestral cooks. <br/><br/>Granny's Tacos may call one of their offerings ""al pastor,"" which it most definitely is not. Rather, it is another Mexican delicacy - cochinita pibil - pork cooked with achiote, an exquisite paste featuring the annatto seed from the tropical achiote tree. Wish they served them with the traditional red pickled onions, too. <br/><br/>The Granny taco is another kind of stewed pork, served with a heap of onions, pico de gallo, a slice of avocado and lime. <br/><br/>This food truck must serve up half an onion with each taco and that's delish. <br/><br/>Their handmade corn tortillas are a mess, though. I don't know how they can even call them tortillas. They're more like thin, wet, flavorless focaccia. <br/><br/>I inhaled the taco fillings and dumped the offending bread.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,6,Soooooo yummy! Worth a trip to Austin. Mole breakfast taco... whaaaat?! My only regret is not getting more.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,7,"Granny's Tacos has been our go-to place for our taco fix.<br/><br/>Sometimes they are out of our favorite green salsa. Sometimes an ingredient or two gets forgotten, like a slice of avocado or bell peppers or jalapeño. But they've been pretty consistent lately, and everything has been on point. Tacos are generouly stuffed and very messy to eat. All is right with the world.<br/><br/>Today I remembered to take photos before we started our feeding frenzy.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,8,"Had the abuela, shrimp, and Birria. All were really sauce and tasty! Really enjoyed the sauciness!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,9,"Such a hidden gem in the outskirts of downtown Austin! I found this place as I was searching for a place to get some breakfast tacos nearby Franklin's BBQ as I waited on the ridiculous line for 5 hours. I stumbled upon Granny's Tacos which looked pretty legit online so I had to try it for myself. I was not disappointed! In fact, it ended up being my FAVORITE breakfast taco! <br/><br/>I only ordered one breakfast taco since my wife and I were going to have a heavy lunch at Franklin's. Omg I wish I had some more the next day... it was so delish! Juicy, flavorful, the salsa was fresh and citrusy, and spicy. The lady at the window recommended the Machaca breakfast taco which came with braised beef, eggs, avocado, onions, tomato, and cilantro on a flour tortilla with your choice of a side of salsa. They have mild green, medium roasted chili, and hot red. I got the roasted chili which was orange in color - so delicious!<br/><br/>5/5 solid food truck serving up the BEST breakfast tacos, in my opinion. I'd definitely come back again.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,10,"Y'all, Ray hooked it up and took us to flavor town with his delicious tacos!<br/>I had the chicken which was *chefs kiss* and the Al pastor which was also delicious.<br/>Him and his son are so kind and holding down the tacos in ATX. Everything was fresh down to the chips and tortilla and the quality spoke for itself it was 10/10.<br/>I had them at Blues on the Green but will definitely be heading there after some bailando on East 7th.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,11,Probably the best tacos I've ever had. Both the breakfast and lunch options were incredible.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,12,Fresh overflowing breakfast tacos. Totally no frills but so tasty. My wife got the mole and it was balanced and tasty. The eggs were clearly fresh and well seasoned. The corn tortillas were nicely chewy.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,13,"Breakfast Taco was one of the food on our list in Austin. Everyone said we must try breakfast taco coming here so we did!<br/><br/>Granny Taco is a food truck located on a busy street. There is street parking available and few spots in the parking lot.<br/><br/>We got the breakfast taco, Ranchero and Mexican coke! There was some hiccups with our order. We wanted only egg and turkey sausage taco but got charged for chorizo as well. The guy who took our ordered insisted that we did order chorizo. There was no avocado in the ranchero because they were out. It would be nice if they tell us about any unavailable items before we order foods. Anyway always check your order and make sure it is correct. Lots of people ordered before us also got their orders wrong. Maybe it was an off day.<br/><br/>There is outdoor seating near the truck and condiments are available upon request! There might be better breakfast taco place out there so I would probably explore other options!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,14,I feel like these tacos are larger than usual. You really only need two and I couldn't really finish my third. I got the migas type one that also had chicharrones (incredible) along with a picadillo steak one and a custom breakfast one. No real complaints. Everything was quite good. I wish they gave you more salsa.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,15,"Get here early to avoid the lines!!! We waited in line about 30 minutes and luckily by the time we ordered our food, some of the people were getting up so we'd have a place to eat. I got the abuela taco, al pastor and a brekkie taco with egg and potato. The egg and potato taco was ok, but the abuela was our favorite. It was so freaking flavorful with the pork adobo!! It came with pico and avocado. I really wanted to try the Rico but they didn't have mole :( overall, I think it's comparable to the other taco places in Austin, but that abuela taco def stands out from the rest! Street parking is avail where you can find a spot!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,16,"And now for the actual, very first taco joint we visited as part of our Austin swing... Picture this:<br/><br/>It's 9:30 in the morning. And there's already a long-line of disheveled millenial and maybe even younger looking patrons, yawning- patiently waiting for their breakfast taco fix. From this, their locally favorite taco food truck.<br/><br/>The best thing we had here was their shrimp taco. I wouldn't put this place in my top 10 taco stands in Austin. But it was pretty delish.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,17,"Why 5 stars? Because I think I may have just eaten the best tacos of my life.<br/><br/>   ---   ---   ---<br/><br/>Everything was going against me in this situation.<br/><br/>I had just driven about 2 hours and 40 minutes from Houston.<br/><br/>I had to pee pretty badly at the halfway point but elected to ride it out to the end.<br/><br/>When I arrived in Austin, my bladder was approaching a Level 7 emergency (there are only 5 Levels).<br/><br/>Of course, Granny's is only a food truck with no attached toilet for your convenience.<br/><br/>I attempted to park in the nearest lot. When I swiped my credit card, the machine just said ""Please wait"" in perpetuity. Perpetuity in my case was probably 90 seconds, but it felt like 3.5 months before I just gave up and drove away. Chances of fraudulent charges hitting my account any day now = 87%.<br/><br/>I looked around for street parking. Finally found a spot that looked halfway legit. A nearby sign said I could swipe my card or download an app. It felt like the end was near for me, so the amount of time it would have taken to download an app and set up an account made that option a non-starter. <br/><br/>I quickly swiped my card, only for the machine to act like something happened, followed by it immediately returning to the main screen. Identity fraud #2 coming right up.<br/><br/>Eventually, the machine worked. I somehow walked to Granny's, and then just past Granny's to a coffee/wine bar. I apologize to the owners here for using your restroom without making a purchase. Your plumbing saved my life on this day.<br/><br/>===Now that you know I lived, time for the actual Granny's review===<br/><br/>I was studying the menu, when the guy opened his window and asked what I wanted. I was overwhelmed and felt not quite ready, so I had to wing it. I knew that the Abuela Taco was the #1 highlight, so that's all I was certain I needed to order. I clumsily blurted out three others. Let's talk about them all:<br/><br/>Abuela: Ironically, this is the only one that I was unimpressed by. It was fine, don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't need to order it again.<br/><br/>The other three? I could eat them every day for the next 50 years.<br/><br/>The Shrimp, the Campechano and the Acambre. Sadly, I am not even 100% sure which was which between the latter two. I *think* The Campechano was my favorite, but I kind of got confused which was which. It's the one on the top-right in my photo.<br/><br/>Either way, all three of these were just incredible. Every bite. Why do all tacos not taste like this? What does Granny's do differently? I have no idea.<br/><br/>All I know is that a 5-star average with over 400 reviews as of my visit is well-deserved. It's going to be hard to come back to Austin again without stopping here.<br/><br/>EDIT: Came back again on my last day in Austin. Ordered a migas and a breakfast taco with eggs, bacon and chorizo. All other tacos that I eat for the rest of my life will pale in comparison to Granny's.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,18,"GET THE SHRIMP TACO!! It was the highlight of the meal and so friggen good. A must get!<br/><br/>We also got two steak tacos which were super salty and overcooked :( The meat portion was huge though.<br/>The birria taco was decent but nothing really special.<br/>Overall, I would come back for the shrimp tacos but everything else we tried wasn't worth it.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,19,"Lived up to the hype! Amongst the plethora of tacos I've tried in Austin, this place has cracked my personal top 5. Mostly because of how well they season and cook their proteins. Green sauce is delicious. It reminds me of the doña at Tacodeli, which is easily the best part of that chain.<br/><br/>Shrimp taco is an absolute must, as many have mentioned. Light and delicious. The shrimp is seasoned and cooked perfectly. So easy to overcook shrimp but no, theirs were plump and juicy. All of the toppings worked so well together. No salsa needed!<br/><br/>Abuela was also very good. Fatty and unctuous but don't be alarmed by all the braising liquid/sauce; it's not as heavy as it looks. Meat is melt in your mouth tender, unlike some shredded meats that can stringy and tough. Pour a little of that green sauce to cut the richness and you get the perfect bite. <br/><br/>Ranchero was slightly disappointing. I love chicharron but it kind of got lost in the taco, or not enough of it. The corn chips are a nice touch but a bit overpowering. I should've ordered the Machaca instead.<br/><br/>The guy taking orders was very efficient, yet patient and friendly at the same time. Few people ahead of me and all of our orders came out in a timely manner. Everything is reasonably priced. 100% recommend.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,20,Came down to Texas to visit Austin and I knew the food seen was amazing. I did my usual yelp search to try to find a great taco spot. This place did not disappoint. I was easily able to pull up and sit at one of the many picnic tables they had. They had a variety of different tacos to choose from. I had gone there for breakfast tacos but I got a variety of different kinds to eat with my husband. The tacos were actually really big so I could only finish two. The tacos were so flavorful and unique compared to the taco trucks we have in Alabama. I had a breakfast taco which had egg/cheese/chorizo. I also ordered a chicken mole. We dove in when we got our tacos! It was so delicious.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,21,"Everything we got was delicious. The favorite was the Migas, but the Machaca was good as well. My daughters shared a torta. We also got a steak burrito which was enormous, it felt like it weighed 5 pounds. We were there around 11am on Sunday and our order was ready in about 20 minutes. I also walked to Revelry around the corner to get a latte which was good too.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,22,"Slap a lap. This place ain't joking around.<br/><br/>Machaca. Alambre. Standouts for sure<br/>Ranchero.  Birria. Also good but not quite on that same esteemed level as the aforementioned tacos.<br/><br/>Friends said the Migas was incredible as well. ""Slightly messy"" but I mean... what kind of the best tacos are not?<br/><br/>With that being said, they were out of chorizo and Abuela tacos at ~11AM on a Saturday? Disappointing but just a reason to come back. Not my favorite hot sauces anyways but those tacos arguably don't need the flavor, but I like my spice so put some on.<br/><br/>Outdoor seating is what is available. Nice coffee shop next door.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,23,"Visiting Austin and we decided to go on what we are calling a ""Taco Tour."" We stopped at many different taco shops/trucks in the downtown area. While there are too many delicious options to count, Granny's came out on top as my ultimate favorite! WOW!<br/><br/>Such a hearty, delicious, flavorful taco. I went with the Picadillo and was blown away. My only regret is not trying more tacos from the menu. Everything looked so good! <br/><br/>I also loved the atmosphere and vibe. The staff was so kind in recommending tacos and helped us to have a great experience. <br/><br/>Will for sure be back anytime I'm in the area!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,24,"We decided to try this restaurant for lunch.... Ok.... It's a good truck but keep in mind they close early.. there is outdoor seating, but the heat is brutal even with umbrellas..  the ordering process was easy, They have a few selections on the menu...<br/>The food took maybe 20 minutes or less to come out..  I ordered a shrimp taco and chicken taco, my husband ordered the Birria Taco, my son- chicken quesadilla and my daughter a chicken taco.. we ordered nachos as well..  chicken taco was average, but the Shrimp<br/>taco was FIRE!!! It had the perfect amount of spice and the shrimp was flavorful.. I could've done without the cooked onions, but it was ok..  The Birria Tacos based on my husband's input was average.. the quesadillas were cheesy and overstuffed, but it did have good flavor..  couldn't really enjoy is because it kept falling apart...the nachos ehhh... the chips were buried under all beans, chicken and cheese. They topped it off with sliced hass avocado, which were brown on each side and not brown because they were cut in advance, brown because they were going bad and it also had the sour flavor.. and not a sour flavor from the lime juice..<br/>So for the drinks we ordered Jarritos... Imagine being in 99 degree weather and being handed warm drinks...after waiting outside patiently for your order to be ready... my husband asked the lady inside the truck if the had ice, she replied, Rudely, ""we don't have no ice.""  And closed the window..<br/>Not really impressed with this 5 star rated food truck...<br/>The location we went to had Portable Bathrooms right behind the truck and the smell was awful.. we moved a few tables away and didn't smell it anymore but the closer you are to the truck, the worse it is...<br/><br/>So to be honest, There is room for growth here, starting with the basics... Cold Drinks... I mean c'mon, Austin is HOT and you're handing people warm drinks... hmmm... <br/>Overall, average tacos, service is ehh...",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,25,"Let me tell you about their tacos. They taste amazing. I got the Machaca on corn, so that the tortilla soaked up all the delicious flavor from the meat juices. The shrimp taco was made with fresh thick shrimp and seasoned to perfection. <br/><br/>The salsas were negligible since each taco was already balanced in flavor.<br/><br/>So why not 5 stars? Well the salsas were not great. The chips and guac were bland. There's seating but you'll have to fight the grackles for your food. The parking is paid.<br/><br/>A phenomenal taco food truck that I'll be back for if I'm picking up some tacos on the go!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,26,"This is an awesome tucked away gem. Staff was great, there's some outdoor seating, and the tacos were the best in Austin in my opinion.  I had a chorizo/egg/cheese and migas. Both were awesome! Definitely worth it to go if you're in town.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,27,Amazing tacos! Fast and friendly and fantastic tasting.  <br/><br/>Stopped by here on the way back from a tough day at the airport. Was rewarded with a very tasty breakfast taco! <br/><br/>Very popular place...easy to see why.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,28,"We stopped here first on our self guided taco tour of Austin. We tried the sausage and bacon tacos. The sausage was cut up hotdog (maybe this is a normal type of sausage here, but we were surprised as it wasn't what we are used to). Bacon was cooked to perfection. Very filling breakfast tacos but somewhat bland. The rojo side sauce was a great addition to spice them up.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,29,"Wishing I could wake up tomorrow and it was Sunday morning in Austin all over again. <br/><br/>Being Hispanic and living in San Antonio, I have eaten my fair share of breakfast tacos, so when I find tacos that stand out, I am always nicely surprised. <br/><br/>Granny's came to play! First, the service was excellent. Prompt but not rushed. Cashier helped me make my decision of the Alambre with chicken, which was delicious. My partner chose the chillaquilles with green salsa. I am usually let down with most chillaquilles I have eaten, but these were by far top 3 I have ever had. I wanted to dump out her taco's contents, throw some shredded chicken, and an egg on top. <br/><br/>Prices, with the exception of the Mexican coke, were very reasonable. So many other breakfast tacos to try in such little time, but I will definitely be back - sooner than later.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,30,"Pretty much the best breakfast taco I've ever had in my life!<br/><br/>I got the chorizo, egg, and cheese breakfast taco and it was honestly amazing! It was so good, that it turned back around and ordered a second one right after finishing it.<br/><br/>I also ordered the Picadillo taco with steak and potatoes which was delicious and the Abuela taco, which was also good, but I'm not as much of a fan of marinated pork. <br/><br/>The tacos are pretty hefty, so I think 2 would be adequate if you're not too hungry and 3 would be a good number if you're hungry!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,31,"Came here for some breakfast tacos and they were great! I love that they have covered tables here - we were able to enjoy both the wait time and our tacos here. Our table enjoyed the Machaca and Veggie Breakfast Tacos. <br/><br/>For parking, we parked on the street near by. There isn't coffee offered here but it is located right by Revival Coffee so it was nice walking over there after and getting a nice coffee from there too.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,32,"Granny's is probably the best tacos I've had in Austin! A group of us swung over here for a late lunch. PSA: they make everything fresh but also make each order individually (instead of bulk making certain repeat orders) so it could be a decent wait to get your tacos esp if you're in a large group. I think there were 5 or 6 orders ahead of me and I waited 10-15 min. That's really my only complaint, the wait time. <br/><br/>Onto the food...I ordered the Alambre (steak, bell peppers, chorizo, bacon, avocado, cheese melted over top), the Abuela (marinated pork, pico avocado), and the Al Pastor. My favorite by far was the Alambre, a little oily but the steak was quite tender and the mix of flavors with the bacon and melted cheese were to die for. You can also get it with chicken instead of steak (was their recommendation) so I would try that next time. Al Pastor was my #2 - succulent pork with nice sweetness from pineapple; this was also pretty messy so come prepared with napkins and a fork! Finally, the Abuela comes in at the end of the best for me. The menu says ""marinated"" but it didn't really hit the spot. The pork was also pretty dry, especially when compared to the Al Pastor. I wouldn't get this taco again. <br/><br/>Overall, fantastic food being served from this taco truck! This is a must have the next time I'm in Austin. My friends also gave the breakfast tacos rave reviews, so I'll have to try those too!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,33,"Tacos are almost a religion in Austin and according to the reviews it seems that Granny's Tacos may be one of its holiest places. With only one day in the city I had to make a pilgrimage to this mecca.<br/><br/>It seems that just like the actual pilgrimage to mecca, getting to Granny's is a perilous journey filled with staggering highs and depressing lows. We easily spent 20 minutes searching for parking that wasn't ridiculously priced. We prowled side alleys, crawled past full lots looking for open spots, and even debated a quick and dirty illegal maneuver. In the end, we squeezed ourselves against a sagging fence, between a telephone pole and another precariously parked vehicle, several blocks away.<br/><br/>After we found a safe-ish spot to stow the car we were finally able to taste these legendary tacos. We ordered an abuela, a shrimp, and a steak taco to give us a good variety to sample. Washing it down with jarritos is almost a requirement.<br/><br/>I'll tell you one thing, before even putting a drop of sauce on any of these tacos the flavor was fantastic. The proteins were cooked perfectly with incredible seasoning across the board. Sauces were a nice touch if you wanted heat or a little something extra, but I honestly didn't need them. The tastes were powerful all on their own.<br/><br/>Surprising no one who reads these reviews, the shrimp taco was the MVP of the group. Huge pieces of shrimp that burst with flavor when you bit into them. If I swing by again I'm ordering two of those bad boys.<br/><br/>Now you may wonder why the 4 star rating. Honestly, the parking situation wa so atrocious that incredible tacos can't make up for it. They could've been gold foil tortillas and gem encrusted fillings and it still wouldn't have made the grueling hunt for parking worthwhile. It's a shame, but at least I got to try them once and see that *most* of the hype was correct.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,34,"Hands down the best tacos in all of Austin, with plenty of options for everyone! As a vegetarian I have yet to be let down with their breakfast tacos or specialty tacos.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,35,"We have family in town and she was wanting something new and different. I wasn't sure what to look for but just started browsing. I came across Granny's and seen they had multiple different yummy options to choose from and I recognized the area from the Trending Machines event by Revival coffee, I chose that spot because it was a short ride and knew there was parking for that area. <br/><br/>You pull up and park right by the food truck and there are picnic tables with umbrellas outside if you wanted to eat there. Your order your food and they give you a ticket number. <br/><br/>I ordered the steak torta and family ordered 2 tacos (Abuela taco &amp; shrimp taco). The torta is huge so its worth the price and everything tastes fresh to order. Bread was soft and warm, the steak was tender &amp; they put just the right amount of cheese. The torta was very good, full of flavor and I was told the tacos were delicious as well along with the salsas given with the food. He puts a good amount of shrimp in the taco and they are a good size as well. You are getting your money's worth. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this food truck and I will come back for more and make this my torta spot. It tastes like you just had abuela's food at home.

Ever since I discovered Granny's I recommend it widely to folks traveling to the Austin area.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,41,This was one of our last stops on our way back to Houston! We wanted some breakfast tacos before we hit the road and I had this place saved to my list of food places to try! We're from Houston so we have a lot of good taco trucks down there but this is the first I've ever seen that had five stars so I had to try it! I ordered the shrimp taco and the Machaca taco which were both suggested to me by the lady helping us since it was our first time she recommended the shrimp since I like shrimp and I wanted a steak egg and cheese taco which was pretty similar to the machaca taco so she recommended I try that one as well. My boyfriend ordered 2 chicken tacos. The shrimp taco was to die for it was so good and the shrimp were huge usually with shrimp tacos they don't give you enough protein but they definitely made sure you would be for field with this taco I wish I ordered two it was so good I almost wanted to turn it back around but we had somewhere to be by a certain time! My boyfriend loved his chicken tacos which he didn't get to eat until we got back to Houston they were still good we just reheat them in the air fryer and it was magnificent! Anytime I go to Austin I have to stop at this taco truck now highly recommend the ingredients were so fresh and veggies crisp I've never had tacos to where the vegetables just melt in your mouth with the protein so even if you're not a veggie lover please get the veggies on it because you don't even notice they're vegetables so flavorful and the salsas add just the right amount of spice depending on your liking. They have plenty of vegetarian and/or vegan options as well,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,42,"I have to say it again.  Where would I drive 35 minutes on Sunday morning for a taco?  Granny's. Migas and Rico never disappoint.  I'll try other places during the week, but Granny gets me on Sunday.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,43,"Just no. Don't do it. First, VERY SALTY. lacking flavor and just tasting salt. I am sorry to say, this is the worst taco I had during my seven day trip to Austin (and I ate an embarrassingly amount of tacos). <br/><br/>I had the mole taco and shrimp tacos. Shrimp tasted rotten and I had to send back. It was also strange that the shrimp was not even cut up but thank goodness because maybe I would not have been able to identify that it was not a good piece. <br/>The person behind the counter asked what was wrong - and I tried to whisper my experience to not tell everyone around. I ordered a chicken taco that was better than the mole chicken taco. The person behind the counter replaced it quickly. <br/><br/>Each taco is wrapped in aluminum and because it's so hot, it makes it very soggy even for just a minute. I was not asked if I wanted a corn or flour tortilla, and read to ask for the corn if you are familiar. The tacos are really messy when they are opened and should probably not serve this unless asked for this. <br/><br/>My love ordered the chicken burrito and everything was able to fall out easily. It was definitely wrapped incorrectly. <br/><br/>We ordered and paid for a Coca Cola and five minutes later told they were sold out and we were able to opt for water. Honestly, I don't like that. We ordered something, you either have it or you don't and just refund the money first. This seems to be a trend. <br/><br/>The tortilla chips were good and guacamole ok.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,44,"Granny knows how to make some good freakin' tacos! Stumbling upon this taco truck on a hungover Sunday morning might be the best thing that happened to me during my visit to Austin. Plenty of picnic table seating available and tons of options on the menu. My taco was super flavorful and bigger than I expected. If the line hadn't been so long, I would've hopped back in for about 50 more of them!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,45,"Unpopular opinion...Granny's did not live up to the hype. I live nearby and always noticed the long line so I was eager to finally try Granny's Tacos but was honestly let down. My boyfriend and I tried a few of the breakfast tacos. He didn't mind them but mine had an overwhelming taste of onion, however, I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese taco that didn't have onion on it at all. It's a food truck, so I'm sure there's lots of overlap with cooking surfaces but I just couldn't get over that onion-y taste. Also, there were crows literally everywhere because the trash was overflowing so not the most welcoming eating environment. <br/><br/>COVID Precautions: It's outdoors, so minimal. Nobody was really wearing masks or enforcing social distancing.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,46,"I've been heartbroken by Granny's for the last time! I went 2x when I first moved to Austin and LOVED it. The breakfast tacos and thick greasy chips and guac were amazing. If anybody visiting Austin asked for food recommendations, Granny's would be on the list.<br/><br/>In the, like, 5x I've gone since, the tacos have just not been good (sloppy, sometimes undercooked, sometimes overcooked) and they *never* have chips and guac. They are also always out of drinks.<br/><br/>We started going to other breakfast taco trucks instead.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,47,"As a vegetarian I am always eager to find a GOOD taco truck that doesn't skimp on the flavor if you don't eat meat. I noticed this spot on a walk down 6th and loved the sweet service from the employees. I came for lunch and was not disappointed. I ordered two tacos which, with white flour tortillas grilled to a crisp, were more then enough. The Chicagoan in me was expecting corn tortillas. The mole was outstanding and I loved the layers of flavors nuanced in each bite. The veggie taco was a solid bite as well, although I could have done without the big chunks of soft potatoes. At a fair pricepoint however I could see how this spot would quickly be my go-to if I lived here. Will definitely come back.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,48,"Oh man this truck was the perfect spot to end our trip to Austin! We have killer tacos and I would eat every day if I could.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,49,"Yep, those 5 star reviews are right on the money. These tacos are fantastic! I ordered an al pastor and an abuela taco. Both were good but the simple al pastor with pico was my #1. The meat was perfectly tender and well seasoned in both. I like al pastor seasoning a tad more than adobo, but would definitely order both again.<br/><br/>The tortillas were fresh, soft, and had some elasticity to them. No booze here, FYI. Enjoy your meal with plenty of napkins on their umbrella covered picnic tables or take it to go. <br/><br/>The gentlemen working were kind and helpful. Service was just perfect so you knew your order was made fresh. Definitely a winner.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,50,"This place is amazing. They truly might serve the best tacos I've ever had. We got there on the earlier side of lunch on a weekday so there wasn't much of a line or wait.  <br/><br/>We Ate:<br/>- Apple Soda - Delicious, tbh it's better than coke<br/>- Topo Chico - I'm white, of course I love this<br/>- Chips &amp; Salsa - Chips were super crispy and still a little warm so you know they're good<br/>- Al Pastor Quesadilla - A tiny bit greasy but really flavorful<br/>- Veggie Taco w. Egg - Needs salsa but otherwise great and filling <br/>- Chilaquil Taco w. Mole - Tied for the other chilaquiles taco for being one of the best tacos I've ever put in my mouth<br/>- Chilaquil Taco w. Verde - Insane. You have to get this. <br/><br/>I legitimately cannot wait to come back here and will dream about their tacos until I do.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,51,"We came here on a Saturday morning for breakfast. We arrived around 9:30 in the morning, and seem to have beat most of the rush. We ordered five tacos in total, with three of them having corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas.<br/><br/>We honestly couldn't tell you what four of the five tacos were, but the one that stood out to me was actually the one that I customized myself. Highly recommend ordering a ""pick two"" taco with chorizo, eggs, and potato. Douse it with some hot sauce, and you'll be a happy camper! We would definitely love to come back.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,52,Delicious food!

I loved the ranchero and the shrimp taco and the chicken quesadilla was delicious!

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,53,OMG!<br/>Wow! What a find! <br/>So this is one of Austin's many taco trucks and it doesn't disappoint. We went for breakfast.

It was a little hard to find but Soo worth it.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,54,"Pretty much the best street tacos I've had in a long time.<br/><br/>This place is really hard to find if you're not from around here, so be aware that there are actually talked behind another store. Plenty of other reviewer's have commented on how to find them so I won't repeat the details here.<br/><br/>I was impressed when I placed my order that the tacos actually took a few minutes to come out, which told me they were being made fresh on the spot.  When I took my first bite I know my instincts were correct. Fresh soft tortillas, piping hot meat, and perfect accoutrements.<br/><br/>The seating was pleasant and enabled me to enjoy my meal in comfort.  Two tacos came to less than $10 and for food of this quality it was definitely worth it.<br/><br/>I have no idea if I'll ever come back, as I'm from out of town, but I'd sure love to!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,55,"There are taco trucks and then there's AMAZING TACO trucks. We went to try their meat tacos, shrimp quesadillas, and chips &amp; guacamole. For drinks, we splurged on a mandarin Jarrito and a Manzana Sidrat (apple). <br/><br/>Each of the meat tacos, marinated steak, chicken, or pork al pastor, had double corn tortillas with cilantro and diced onions. The first bite was like a free trip to Mexico, maybe a marketplace in Nuevo Leon, or your granny's house in the valley. This ain't your Tex-Mex. This is the real deal.<br/><br/>We tried the green salsa (mild), the red (medium hot) and roasted red (medium). The giant shrimp in the quesadilla were a meal on their own. The quesadilla was three very cheesy pieces full of red bell peppers, sauteed onions, and other items with the giant shrimp. They were served with some lettuce, diced tomato, and sour cream on the side. Ok, so there is cheese and sour cream, but your abuela might like it. We made ourselves save it for another day and it was still delish.<br/><br/>Everything came with sliced limes. The chips were thicker than your normal store bought fare, with a satisfying crunch and no greasiness. <br/><br/>In all, we would love to come back here and try everything on the menu.",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,58,"My granny was big on homemade ranch so I didn't grow up with tacos like this and let me tell you, as much as I love creamy buttermilk ranch, I would have traded it in an instant for one of Austin's top rated spots!<br/><br/>From breakfast to lunch, you honestly can't go wrong. I'd say the size is kind of perfect...you could have one and be tied over until a more sizable meal presents itself or order a few and walk away completely satisfied but not bogged down for a few hours.<br/><br/>I liked the pastor and pollo but I LOVED my chorizo, egg, potato, and cheese!<br/><br/>In case you're not in the know...food truck in an alley between 7th and 6th, across-ish from Austin Body Works.

There are a few shops and places to look around while you wait. It was about 20 mins for a couple of tacos. They'll hold the bag until you're back. <br/><br/>There are a few picnic tables and the crowd does clear out quickly.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,60,"RUN DONT WALK! We just spent the past weekend in Austin and I randomly stumbled upon this taco truck on our first morning in town. We ordered three tacos to split between my friend and I and that was enough to be satisfied. We ordered a migas, red chilaquil and alambre the first time and all were ridiculously good. The stand out star was the migas taco. <br/><br/>Over the course of our trip we tried another ""very well known"" ""award winning"" taco truck with store outposts around the city and we had high hopes. Nevertheless granny's blew them out of the water for a fraction of the price. The tacos here are filling and well worth your money. We loved them so much that we actually returned as our last meal of our trip . This time my friend and I each got two tacos, and we were stuffed!! All of them were out of this world.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,62,"3 Mexicans and a Filipino go to a taco stand, and we leave full but with mixed feelings. This place has great service and a friendly staff. If you speak Spanish I suggest a conversation with granny. She is a delight. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, this taco truck failed in one of the most important parts of the taco, you guessed it, the tortilla. It tasted store bought which lowers the quality of the taco to the point that you need to use the salsa to mask the flavor. <br/><br/>That being said the tacos were still good. My main suggestion is order either the breakfast tacos, the abuelita or the shrimp but don't forget the salsa it helps. <br/><br/>I would normally review this lower because of the tortilla quality but I can feel abuelitas chancla slap me across the head if I reviews this any lower.",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,67,"Been dying to try this place for so long and finally made it before they closed (which is at 3pm everyday). <br/>Asked the guy working what the most popular tacos was so went with his recommendations of an Abuela, Picadillo and a chorizo egg and cheese because I can't try a new taco place without trying a chorizo egg and cheese. This is my way of truly comparing them and honestly just judging them bc they better have a damn good chorizo egg and cheese for me to come back. And these guys did. <br/>The abuela was delicious and very different than the usual tacos I've had so would definitely recommend this. <br/>The Picadillo was kinda bland without the sauce they provide you so once I drenched it in that spicy chipotle type sauce it was so good. <br/>I can't wait to come back here and try out a bunch of others.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,70,"I was so excited to try out Granny's, but unfortunately was very disappointed. I ordered the Abuela and Shrimp tacos ($4.25 each), which I consider to be slightly on the pricier end for their size even though they were pretty filling tacos. <br/><br/>As I was eating my Shrimp taco, I noticed that the piece of shrimp I was chewing didn't have the right texture and when I looked at it closely, I could see it was still raw. Then I checked the other pieces of shrimp and they weren't fully cooked through. Needless to say, I couldn't eat any of the shrimp and because of the piece of shrimp I did eat, my stomach was quite upset the following day. Even if the shrimp had been fully cooked, I think the amount of the sauce on the taco was overkill and it was pretty drenched. And the Abuela taco did not make up for it - it was very salty. I sadly cannot recommend this place.",5 star rating

To be honest, I don't know what taco is in the picture but it's either the abuela or alhambre and it was AMAZING. The meat is so flavorful, the avocado is so fresh and the salsas are so well made.

Kind of hard to find As they're  on a side street. The customer service is really good as well.<br/><br/>Food: I got three tacos but only ate two. The tacos here are huge. Extremely big. You definitely get your moneys worth here. They don't skimp you  like other restaurants. Their tacos are fully loaded and straight up amazing. The chilaquiles was very tasty! Lots of flavor. The pork taco was so good too. The third taco that I didn't get to eat was the abuela. All of the ingredients are super fresh and good. Everything is made to perfection. Everything is cooked fresh. I literally have all good things to say about this place. I would definitely suggest giving them a try if you're in the area. The green sauce is so good. There's probably some of the best green sauce I've had in a long time. It's very very spicy and very good.<br/><br/>Customer service: Rey is doing a great job here. He is extremely personable and knows how to talk to clients. He made the great recommendations and I was happy he did because they were so good. Rey is doing an exceptional job here at grannies Taco. He was doing such a good job I wonder if he is part owner or son of the family.

Granny's is a good truck, you line up, order, take a seat and wait maybe 5 mins and then it's taco time! <br/>The Picadillo is really good, as is the Rico. <br/>Everything on the menu looks good and there are lots of options (maybe 10 different taco options) and they also have other food, but most people seem to be ordering tacos. <br/>There is about 4 large outdoor tables, umbrellas, and people seem ok to have others join their table (sitting at opposite end). <br/>Delicious. Highly recommend!",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,98,Solid Austin breakfast tacos. I'd suggest you make your own from<br/>the ingredient list. 3 tacos is a good amount. 2 might do it for a lighter meal. Good coffee next door.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,99,"Tacos were delicious! Remember to request corn tortillas on your tacos! I believe the default is flour. My friends and I forgot at first, but thankfully I remembered pretty soon after ordering, and they were able to make them on corn instead. <br/><br/>The tacos themselves were full of flavor, juicy, and overall really delicious. I also loved the crunchiness and freshness of their flour tortillas, and the guacamole was fantastic. The food truck is near some picnic tables, and there was plenty of open seating. The guy taking our order was also very nice. Overall a great taco food truck!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,100,"I came here for the first time and it instantly became one of my favorite taco places in Austin. The prices are great for the heaping portion sizes. I typically need at least 3 tacos to feel full, but Granny's had me getting full after 1.5. I got the Abuela taco and the shrimp taco. Both were juicy and full of flavor. Just make sure to get here earlier in the afternoon as they ran out of chicken and chips by the time I ate. The wait time for food can be up to 30min, but it was definitely worth it and I can see why they're so popular.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,101,Overall: The Red Sauce Taco is amazing!!!<br/><br/>First of all I love being able to order my food through this app. The red sauce taco is delicious it has chilaquiles which give it a little crunch then they add the granny's sour cream and it just makes it delish. It is pretty filling and two was enough for me. Add a coke and it makes the tacos even better.,5 star rating

Usually I feel like I need to eat 5 tacos from other places to feel full but Granny's got me full in two. Sadly, they are so popular that I got antsy dining in even though it was outdoors seating.

It's obvious the chips are freshly made and they were easily some of my favorite. Then we shared the Alambre and shrimp taco and both made great impressions. They were filled with sauce with such great flavor combinations, we were upset we shared.

You will want to make the journey and pay your respects at this holy place.<br/><br/>I'm always a little skeptical of places that have 5 full star reviews. People get caught up in the hype and rave about a place because its already been designated as a great place. Well, believe these reviews. Grannys is outstanding. Yes, you will likely wait a little while, but it's so worth it. I am not exaggerating to say these are some of the very best (if not best) tacos Ive ever had.<br/><br/>Everything I ate was delicious, but the Ranchero taco almost made me cry it was so good. I seriously dont know what magic they use to make eggs, pico, cheese, avocado and chicarron taste so amazing but it works. The 3 tacos I chose were straight off of recommendations of the owners. Obviously,  they didn't steer me wrong.<br/><br/>Make sure you also try the different salsas. They are completely unnecessary but also delicious. <br/><br/>Go now!",5 star rating

No pictures because neither survived. Sorry about that!<br/><br/>The taco was one of the best I've ever had. The green sauce was fantastic. Just to many awesome flavors in one taco and that little crunch from the crushed tortilla chips was perfect. It was a little heavy on the onions so beware if you're not into that. <br/><br/>The fries were fantastic as well. I did end up sharing these lol. The steak was tender which can always make or break being a topping on fries. The fries were fresh and crispy. The toppings were ample and fresh. <br/><br/>My friend had a torta and it was HUGE! I can't remember which one she got but she loved it. <br/><br/>Price-wise this is a no brainer. It wasn't crazy expensive and the ingredients tasted quality. This spot is a must try!",5 star rating

We arrived not long before they were closing and when I noticed they were packing up and on their way out I had to stop what I was doing and let them know how damn good everything was.<br/><br/>We were served by Liz and she was great. No idea when I'll ever be back in Austin but I'll definitely make it by again and try more from the menu.<br/><br/>If I was going to critique anything, I could use a touch more bacon in the breakfast taco. Everything was so good that I wanted the last bite to be perfect, but hey. No biggie.<br/><br/>If you're choosing between Granny's and somewhere else, just stop by Granny's.

That said, I'm a bit taken aback to see this place with a solid five-star rating on here. Granny's is good, but not *that* good, and for the most part its menu is par for the course for Austin Tex-Mex.<br/><br/>It's still well-priced, however, despite its recent price increases on most of the menu, and to be fair it has a few items I've rarely (if ever) seen elsewhere in town, e.g. mole tacos (the Rico). The Abuela is arguably the best bet, but I'm not entirely sure about the raves for their migas tacos; on the east side alone I can name a half-dozen places with superior options, though I'm admittedly an Austin OG (almost, but not quite, a native).",5 star rating

We got the Abuela and the ranchero and both were amazing! I preferred the Abuela for the delicious meat but my boyfriend liked the crunch of the Ranchero more!<br/><br/>It was kinda busy when we got there, short line but a lot of people waiting.

I loved the music playing and appreciated the outstanding customer service. <br/><br/>I ordered three tacos to share with my husband. Each taco was made to order and was served steaming hot.

I usually prefer flour tortillas, but highly recommend that you request corn when ordering at Granny's. They are homemade and outstanding. My favorites are the ranchero taco and the chilaquil taco. The chilaquil taco is one of the single best food items I've had so far in Austin. So much umami. Eyes rolling to the back of the head delicious! In general, there is something really unique about the food here.

They know how to portion a taco so that you can hold it and eat it without looking like a wierdo. I ordered two breakfast tacos with egg, sausage, cheese and spinach. The order didn't take long and the guy who took our order was really kind and had great manners. His hand was wrapped in a bandage, he either got a gnarly tattoo, or really burned himself and was working through the pain. Your dedication was not lost bro, and I hope you see this Yelp shout out. <br/>The tacos were filling, tasty, well portioned and really helped us kick off a day of exploring the awesome and beautifully weird sights in Austin. They even had a guy who works there who looks like Anthony Bordain! We had a quick laugh about that. <br/>If you fins yourself in Austin with the morning munchies, give this place a try.

Chorizo/egg/bean/cheese, chorizo/egg/potato/cheese, migas/cheese, and the Alambre. My favorite was DEFINITELY the alambre taco! My second favorite was the chorizo/egg/potato/cheese taco. These tacos are small, but they LOAD them up with filling. Two will fill up a normal sized human with a basic appetite.

A real Abuela cooked best tacos in my life. I used be proud of living in LA where best tacos everywhere in cheap price, but this is gonna be the next chapter in my life.",5 star rating

I ordered the La Gringa for lunch and me and my baby were dancing with all of the delicious flavors! It was fresh, hot, bursting with flavor and the verde salsa was spicy but not too spicy which I loved! Pricing was very reasonable and I would definitely come back!<br/><br/>BTW, they speak both english AND spanish!

They have a nice shady area with canopy tables for seating and in the morning it's very pleasant even in Texas September. I never saw granny but two guys were inside whipping it up.

I'm a veggie girl so I was a big fan of their Haley Bowl! I also am a big broccoli fan - I've never seen anywhere else offer broccoli on tacos! <br/><br/>The tortillas were soft and fresh - unsure if they are made in the truck but if they are not, they fooled me.<br/><br/>My only complaints were <br/>1. I asked for one of my tacos without cheese and their was cheese on it - luckily I do not have a lactose allergy but dairy doesn't make me feel great. <br/>2.

A cute family owned business with great food and great service. <br/><br/>We ordered the al pastor, campechano (steak and chorizo) and my bf got the abuela taco (shredded pork with adobo sauce). He said the abuelo taco was amazing (so much so he ate it all without saving me a bite) and that it was the best of the three. I thought the al pastor was delicious and the campechano was a little too salty for my taste, probably because of the chorizo. All our tacos came on flour tortillas, but I'm not sure if the option for corn tortillas is available. <br/><br/>The salsas are great and really spicy, which I love. The wait takes a bit of time but everything is made in-house and is great quality.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,187,I pulled up into a little parking lot and there's a food truck with a nice tent for you to sit under. I was driving along César Chávez in the morning when I got hungry I decided to stop at the most convenient place and this was it. I ordered a migas and Macha breakfast taco. First of all these tacos are humongous so two will fill you up. Unless you are under 23 and you probably have a high metabolism you could probably kill three or four of these. The salsa is delicious and a big chunk of egg fell out of one of my tacos. I was a little sad but I continued eating anyways. Overall would come here again to try out there afternoon menu.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,190,"I touched down in Austin with about three hours to burn, and I decided then and there that I would spend those hours visiting three of the highest rated taco spots in East Austin before writing a three way heads up review, so let's get this party started.<br/><br/>Tacos Guerrero vs. Granny's Tacos vs. La Sabroza<br/><br/>Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?<br/><br/>All three of these taco spots were trucks, with Tacos Guerrero being the largest and Granny's Tacos the smallest. That's not really relevant as all three spots also had nearby picnic tables for local diners, but I thought it was interesting nonetheless that all three were dealing with the same kitchen parameters within which to whip up their wares. Granny's took the cake as far as a quaint atmosphere went with a super friendly server to boot, but all three of these spots were perfectly fine. <br/><br/>Tacos Guerrero: Star (1)<br/>Granny's Tacos: Star (1)<br/>La Sabroza: Star (1)<br/><br/>Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?<br/><br/>When the heck did street tacos in Austin become so much more expensive than LA? To be fair these are larger tacos, but I was pretty surprised at paying between $2.00 and $3.00 for a single taco. The prices shook out per the below, and La Sabroza had notably smaller tacos compared to the competition:<br/><br/>Tacos Guerrero: $2.00 for breakfast, $2.50 for lunch<br/>Granny's Tacos: $3.00 for lunch<br/>La Sabroza: $2.00 for lunch<br/><br/>Granny's were more expensive, but they ended up being the largest, and the best.<br/><br/>Tacos Guerrero: Star (2)<br/>Granny's Tacos: Star (2)<br/>La Sabroza: Star (2)<br/><br/>Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?<br/><br/>It's here that the grown-ups separated themselves from the children if you will. La Sabroza had some pretty weak offerings in my mind, with mediocre meats (asada had very little taste) that were slightly overcooked. Tacos Guerrero had good tacos for both breakfast and lunch with ingredients that were nice and cooked together, but both fell woefully short of Granny's, which were exceptional. <br/><br/>My pastor lunch taco at Granny's was marvelous, with a fresh lightly toasted tortilla, wonderfully flavorful pastor, and some nice peripherals like freshly chopped cilantro and just a smidge of pico that brought everything together with their excellent salsas. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Tacos Guerrero: Single Star (3)<br/>Granny's Tacos: Two Stars (4)<br/>La Sabroza: No Stars (2)<br/><br/>Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?<br/><br/>Granny's? Yes. La Sabroza or Tacos Guerrero? Not so much.<br/><br/>Tacos Guerrero: No Star (3)<br/>Granny's Tacos: Star (5)<br/>La Sabroza: No Star (2)",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,216,"This has been one of my favorite Taco places as I'm a regular now, and I'd have to say one of the Top 3 Taco places in Austin.  Granny's Tacos really does it well as you can tell she puts a lot of love into her food.  <br/><br/>There's so many great things about this place, let me lay it out; <br/><br/>1.  The Breakfast Tacos ROCK!  My favorite ones are the Veggie Taco (with egg) and the Spinach + Egg + Cheese.  I always get them on corn, the tacos are always large with plenty of egg and toppings, it's just really good and doesn't bog you down.  <br/><br/>2.  The Chicken Mole Taco is AWESOME!  I love love this taco and get it on every visit, always on corn, it keeps well overnight, and lots of chicken and the mole is very flavorful.  It's definitely one of my faves.  <br/><br/>3.  Her salsa selection ROCKS!  She's got 4 of them and they're all so very tasty and carry some heat.  The green rivals the Dona, her red salsa is more robust and carries extra heat - - I love the flavor.  She has a pot of fresh salsa you scoop out with a ladle - - omg it's really flavorful.  The bright orange is their habanero - - for which her husband created and she perfected.  It's really hot but packs a lot of flavor.  <br/><br/>4.  I love her homemade corn tortillas!  I'd describe it as a thicker yellow corn, very robust, not the thin and flimsy corn tortillas I'm used to, and it's really flavorful.  She does a superb job in putting the tacos together and packaging them. <br/><br/>5.  Great bang for the buck - - I think you get a great quality product here, with her tacos being larger than some places, for a great price.  You can't ask for more.  Some taco places leave you asking for more, but her tacos are filling and quality good.  I usually buy a few and store a couple in the fridge for the next morning - - they all keep very well.  <br/><br/>I can eat her awesome food and never feel bogged down afterwards, and that's how I know she uses quality ingredients.  The service here has always been very friendly and courteous.  This lovely husband and wife couple are always really nice as we love to talk and catch up on the latest, and I always remind the hubby how lucky he is to have someone who is such a great cook and makes exceptional food.  He definitely knows and appreciates it.",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,224,I had 2 steak tacos and one of the shrimp tacos..both were amazing!! The steak tacos were my favorite.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,228,"Seriously, a segment of our conversation: <br/><br/>Mr Vasquez: ""Ask your phone who has the best tacos.""<br/>Me:   ""Hey Siri, who has the best tacos in Austin, Texas?""<br/>Siri:   ""The highest rated option I found is Granny's Tacos, which averages 5 stars and is inexpensive.""<br/>Me:   ""Did you by chance, practice law at some point?""  <br/><br/>Chef Vasquez really is a granny doing all the cooking in this trailer, and it's her husband you'll be dealing with up front. I believe their daughters are the Veracruz All Natural dynasty found throughout Austin, and you kind of wish you had a dollar for every taco this family's been involved with. A lot of passion here. <br/><br/>You can play it safe with a fajita taco that's pretty good, but it's her specialty tacos that are pretty great. The big chunk of avocado in the shredded pork Abuela was a perfect pairing, and they insisted I switch to a homemade corn tortilla for their Mole chicken &amp; rice. They were correct. I started thinking, ""I want more of all this on a plate."" I never got around to trying the salsas in a cooler, none of my stuff needed it.   <br/><br/>I always benchmark breakfast tacos at a place I've never been to before, but they were literally out of eggs on a Thursday at 1:30pm. I'll just have to get there earlier. And yes, I shouldn't jump the gun with five stars before trying a classic bacon &amp; egg, but my instinct is I won't be disappointed.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,232,Omg!!!!! We are touring texas and definitely had to stop by for 6th street. My buddy saw my check in at Austin and was like dude have your brunch at Granny's and I was like naa! Don't wAnt to go off track my route. But I am glad I took his recommendation seriously and took that detour. The best decision I took in this trip fOr the soul food. :) loved every bite of it. So we were 4 of us and one of them is vegetarian even she enjOyed her tacos. I loved my tortA. I ordeRed  this with chicken and the portion was insanely big. Then my buddy ordEred rico taco with mole sauce truly justified $3.50 price for a taco. The surprise and unique   Was their breakfast taco. Again super awesome. Also tHey  have salsas in the container it was one of a kind. The red one in the bottle had a kick to it. The regular salsa was yum too. The green salsaa was my fav. Shake it and then use it.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,235,"If you are looking for tacos do not waste your time going to the ""instagram worthy"" restaurants around the city. Granny's tacos is one of the best if not best tacos I have ever tried, I have visited Mexico before and plenty of famous Mexican restaurants around the US. There is no comparison, these tacos are flavorful and simple nothing new but pure traditional home made food. I understand that they close early in the afternoon and I think that is probably one of the secrets to the exceptional cooking and service, not overworking anyone and giving plenty of time for food prep. <br/>We had a couple of chorizo and egg tacos and they were great! then we tried the ranchero taco and it was even better, but when we tried the MOLE and SALSA VERDE tacos we were blown away by the flavor and complexity of the sauces on such a simple and well thought of taco you could really taste the freshness and each of the ingredients they were truly EXCEPTIONAL!!!! and we will make sure to come to Austin just for these tacos, if you are lucky enough to actually live in Austin do yourself a favor and stop by.",5 star rating

I'd have to agree, this place really does have the best breakfast tacos. I only ordered two because they are big, but I wish I had ordered more to take home with me for later. I'll be back next time I visit Austin. In fact, this place is more reason to come back and visit Austin.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,238,"We ate at an absolute ton of tacos from various places of both truck and non-vehicle related establishment on our Austin trip, and Granny's were the best. It's a bit out of the way, and may not look like much, but at the end of the day you're there for the tacos and they be gooooooooodddddddd. The long and short of it:<br/><br/>1. Tacos: Breakfast tacos. Non-breakfast tacos. Vegetarian tacos. Tacos with cactus. Bowls..... which are like deconstructed tacos. Lots of variety which is always nice to see. 2 tacos were plenty for everyone (I had 3 because I'm a glutton). Everything was tasty and fresh. Worth a try over other Austin taco trucks.<br/><br/>2. Price: 2 tacos and a bottle of water ran $9 which works for me and for what you get. We had tacos that were cheaper, as well as ones that were more expensive, so mid-price + quality = a good taco deal.<br/><br/>3. Wait: Granny's is pretty popular and they seem mostly made to order, so a pretty sizeable line will likely have formed outside when you get there. It may take a bit to get your food, which was the only negative part of the meal. Usually this wouldn't deter me but there are a lot of really good tacos in Austin, so Granny's would only be my main choice if I was in the area/had time to wait. Worth it if that's your case.<br/><br/>4. Location: A bit out of the way but not un-walkable distance from 6th st. Make the journey if you're in the area.<br/><br/>Granny's was a shining light in the endless sea of taco trucks in Austin. Not so much better that others we tried to go out of our way, but we were in the area and it made for a great taco brunch. Worth a try!<br/><br/>Overall Grade: B",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,239,"The food here is incredible and if you spend any time in Austin you need to at least try one of their tacos. I've tried a variety of tacos, quesadillas, and the guac. It's all fantastic, but I love the tacos the most and smother everying in Granny's sauce. It's really delicious. There's no question it's one of the very best taco food trucks in Austin and you're missing out if you haven't eaten here. It's also super convenient that you can place your order ahead of time online. In my experience the projected order readiness time has always been accurate so additional bonus points for saving me time!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,240,"I've been searching for my new taco spot in Austin for a while now, now that Houston has Tacodeli and Torchy's to claim for its own.  I haven't explored too much since leaving Austin, but a friend recommended it to me, and I have to say, it's a winner!<br/><br/>The owner here is really friendly, and gives great recommendations.  I had the ranchero, campechano, and granny tacos, and they were all fantastic.  I HIGHLY recommend the ranchero one though - it comes with chicharron and avocado!  It's a fantastic combination.  The sauces here too are great as well - their green sauce is spicy and creamy, reminiscent of tacodeli's dona sauce.  It goes well with anything!<br/><br/>Other tacos of note I'd want to try - there's tacos that contain broccoli and cactus, which my friends really enjoyed.  I also wanted to try the chilaquiles one too!  <br/><br/>Come hungry.  You're going to want to try a good number of these, and these tacos are pretty good sized.  I'd recommend 2-4 depending on how hungry you are - but if you can, go for more!  I give granny the matt thumbs up of approval!",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,254,"Really good, surprisingly large tacos. They are stuffed to the brim with meat and goodies so you'll definitely leave full. I say 2 will make you content for an average person is plenty, 3 if you're pretty hungry.<br/><br/>I opted for a steak fajita, an al pastor and a ranchero. The al pastor is good deep red, slightly smoky with just a bit of pineapple to balance it all out. The steak fajita is flavorful, albeit salty - not much onion, pepper filler - its all beef; I actually would prefer some more vegetation to cut the salt and the meatiness.<br/><br/>But whats the best about Granny's is the ranchero. Ever wanted non-vegetarian migas? That's the glory of the ranchero as they add pork rinds to your tacos on top of the chips, eggs, and avocado. Yes it's all in there and it works gloriously in a textural sense. Slap some of that spicy green salsa on there and you have a perfectly balanced taco. I might have to say its the new best breakfast taco in Austin that I've tried.<br/><br/>Their tortillas look, feel and taste homemade too. I guess I forgot to specify corn or flour but the flour ones I got by default were all excellent.<br/><br/>So come on over to Granny's. They'll treat you like you're at home (if your home is a food trailer on the east side that is).",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,285,"We ended up here by chance.  We were on our way to Phoenician on SI35 frontage to take in supper before going to the Nicks/Pretenders concert at The Erwin Ctr.  We were running behind schedule because of me, and, when we got downtown we were met with roadblocks!  The whole area in front of Phoenician was blocked off for SXSW.  Dammit!!  Panick started to kick in as we didn't have a plan B.  <br/><br/>I steered us towards Kebabalicious on the east side.  No red fish, but, a kebab sounded like the perfect plan B.  Well wouldn't you know there was no fucking parking to be found except across the street in front of some hammock store.  Parking there was metered at $10 for 6 hours!  Fuck that!  We parked anyway deciding we would sit outside on the patio and watch our car.  Then we saw this roach coach and some guy standing out in front of it.<br/><br/>Pretty much the conversation boiled down to us eating at Granny's and he would make sure we didn't get a ticket/towed.  Not what I had in mind, but, that was a good deal and since we were already pressed for time, we took the gentleman up on his offer.  I got the chicken fajita on corn and Carl got the beef fajita on white.  We both enjoyed our tacos very much, but, I will point out that prep took quite a while.  We were already pressed for time and the stress made it all seem so much longer.  The tacos were definitely worth the wait.  The salsa was really good, and, those corn tortillas were da bomb!  I would definitely eat here again and I do recommend that if you are in the area stop and check them out.<br/><br/>P.S.  We got to the concert with time to spare and really enjoyed both acts!!  One helluva show.  Thanks Granny's for being there!!",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,288,"In a foodie town like Austin, when you see something that has five stars across-the-board you have to try it, and Granny's did not disappoint in the slightest. I'm very glad that one of the reviews I read mentioned the mole because that's what I got and I will probably crave it for the rest of my life now. My husband got something that he loved, I think it was a breakfast taco of some sort but I was too obsessed with my mole taco to remember!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,289,"I didn't mean to go here but I'm so glad I did. What a sweet little taco truck. We were looking for coffee but saw the truck and decided it was destiny. We went with the cactus egg and cheese taco, and the chicharon taco. I'm used to the fast paced city life, so when these tacos took 30 minutes to come out.. I was about to tear my eyelashes out. It felt like forever but honestly they were really great and the staff was apologetic about the wait (which they totally didn't need to be). <br/>The chicharon taco had a beautiful crunch - get it. <br/>Even the christian radio station they blast really added to the experience. Just take it easy, don't rush, and get these tacos.",5 star rating

And each time, the food tasted flat out incredible. Their veggie and migas tacos are by far the best I've had. I have a go-to salsa that I use at home but their salsas were so dang good that I didn't even need mine. This may very well be the pinnacle of breakfast tacos in the states, let alone Austin.",5 star rating

My personal favorites are the BACON, EGG AND CHEESE tacos... soooo good :) <br/><br/>Also, the corn tortillas are made from scratch and wow they are delicious! <br/><br/>The only con about Granny's Tacos is the wait. Sometimes it can take a while to get your tacos but TRUST ME... IT'S WORTH IT. Everything here is very fresh and authentic.

It's a bold statement in the taco Mecca of the southwest. <br/><br/>My brother comes here all the time and had recommended it to me, but by the time I got there I had forgotten what tacos he told me to get. I went for a potato egg and cheese and a chilaquiles taco with mole (Armando confirmed this was a good choice). <br/><br/>The chilaquiles was quite possibly the best thing I've ever eaten, let alone best taco. The tortilla chunks inside were thick and fried but not so pokey as to spear ya in the mouth. The mole was just sweet and smoky enough. Granny makes the tortillas from scratch and sh*% can you tell the difference. AMAZING. <br/><br/>We were surprised at the end of our meal with two complimentary blue corn tortilla tacos - apparently Monday is blue corn day. I wasn't hungry but I ate one anyway. Should really tell you all you need to know.",5 star rating

There are another 6 or 7 in that tier, but so far Granny's are a cut above everything else I've had. Eggs are fluffy, their meat quality is great, but the tortillas are what I suspect are pushing them over the top. I will without a doubt prioritize a stop here any time I'm in town as long as this place is still going. There the only 5 star rated spot for a reason. The Yelp hype is real.",5 star rating

As others mentioned, the wait can be a bit long (20 minutes for me) but the tacos came out hot. At $2.50 each, it's not a bad deal for a pretty basic 3 ingredient breakfast taco. No seasoning of the eggs so you definitely need to add one of their sauces. The tacos were ok, just nothing special.",5 star rating

Granny's is the type of place that gives me a happy heart from the kindness of the owner and a full stomach with the best breakfast tacos in Austin. My 5 star review might get lost in the copious amounts of stellar reviews of Granny's, but as I go I hope to leave you with a story that won't be lost. I asked Armando (the owner) why he is so happy all of the time. He said that he is happy because god is good! Well Armando, I don't know what heaven is like, but I think that if we do eat from time to time that someday you'd be at the top of god's list to make us tacos and make us smile.",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,352,"Oh. My. GOD!<br/><br/>I had an unforgettable taco experience at Granny's called a chilaquiles taco. The taco starts with chilaquiles made with the salsa of your choice cooked to crispy perfection. Those are placed in a soft, hot tortilla (also of your choice) then topped with shredded chicken, crumbled cotija cheese, diced onions, and a pickled jalapeno. Boom! Flavor explosion! I tried all 3 of the salsas, and I recommend the green salsa because of its bright tomatillo flavor balanced with a warm, savory, smooth garlic and chicken broth flavor. I also recommend getting a corn tortilla; I'm pretty sure it's home made.<br/><br/>I had another taco, the abuela. I remember it being good, but I clearly don't remember it well since I remember it having steak and avocado while the menu clearly says it has chicharron and egg. I also tried la gringa, and I regret ordering it. It's basically a gourmet crunch wrap without the crunch. Sure, it was full of cheesy goodness with plenty of flavorful meat and vegetables, but the tacos are so much tastier in my opinion.<br/><br/>If I ever have the pleasure of returning to Austin, I will be sure to get 3 life-changing chilaquiles tacos and wash it down with a Topo Chico at Granny's Tacos.

It took a while for us to make the trek to the food truck in East Austin, but oh man, was it ever worth it.<br/><br/>For starters, there's a solid selection of tacos available. And the gentleman running the truck (Armando) is passionate about their food, and it shows. Asked for his suggestions, and got a tour of the menu. We settled on a pair of breakfast tacos, a chilaquiles, and a shredded pork and avocado. <br/><br/>Now, I'm not generally a corn tortilla person, but if I can give one tip: get the corn tortillas. Hand-made to order, they take the tacos to the next level.<br/><br/>Prices are totally fair ($2.50-3.50ish a pop), the flavors are all on point (didn't even need salsa on the breakfast tacos), and the folks running the truck are a joy. <br/><br/>Next time you're craving tacos, or want to show off why tacos are a staple food in Austin, make a point to swing by. Simply sublime.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,355,"Thad breakfast tacos of course. They were good, but could use just a little something more. I would eat there again though!

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,361,Chorizo breakfast taco was delicious... but it wasn't 30-minutes wait in the sun whilst watching the people who ordered after you get their order and finish their food- delicious.  30 minutes for 2 tacos (one with basic ingredients) seems excessive.,5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,362,"I don't do Yelp reviews. But after trying the machaca and the mole taco I was compelled.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,363,"Holy crap this is a fantastic taco stand.  We went there on an hour lunch break in between classes because our buddy had seen the reviews.<br/><br/>The funny part is I was initially pretty unhappy with them because they are...not....fast.  We waited a long time for our food and ended up being late getting back to class.  I totally was thinking, how does this place have a 5 star rating?<br/><br/>I tried my food.  5 stars.  Unequivocally 5 stars.  These are hands down the best tacos I've ever had in any US State, including California where I grew up.  Their food manages to be original while hitting all the right classic taco truck notes.  A close second to the awesomeness of their food is the homemade salsas they have chilling in the cooler by the window.  I tried (and loved) all of them.<br/><br/>These guys took 35 mins to make me 3 tacos and I was late for class.  No doubt in my mind they deserve 5 stars.  That should tell you how good they are.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,364,"This place is really good. I see why they are 5 stars. Probably some of the best, if not the best, tacos I have had in Austin and I've been here 15 years now. Well done.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,365,"I'm giving this place four stars because the owner was so kind and patient when taking our order. We ordered 2 chilaquil tacos and I asked them not to include cheese because I wasn't sure it was pasteurized. I was so excited because they make them the true Mexican way! Chicken, salsa, homemade tortilla chips, queso fresco and crema Mexicana. To my disappointment both my tacos were covered in cheese! :( they also had a really strange seasoning in them that I was unable to get by. My husband ordered the ranchero taco and tacos and the granny taco... he wasn't impressed either. I wanted to love this place but it just wasn't for us.",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,369,"Granny's tacos are legitimately on the running for best tacos in Austin. Each taco is expertly crafted yet still a great value. What I love most about this place is that you can tell everything is high quality; from the salsas to the corn tortillas. <br/><br/>Speaking of tortillas do you yourself a favor and get any taco on corn. You've never had a corn tortilla like the ones here. Additionally, they use nopales in their tacos which is not something you'll see often around Austin. <br/><br/>In a city inundated with great taco places, granny's tacos elevates itself above the rest.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,370,"This taco truck is everything one could possibly want from a taco truck in Austin. I was directed here by the fine folks at Texas Coffee Traders, when I asked for a ""heady taco spot within walking distance."" East Austin is seeing similar growth to the rest of the city, but this taco truck isn't a recent hipster addition, rather, it's a family-owned spot that serves a delicious variety of authentic tacos. I had three, which I unfortunately can't remember exactly (it was a couple of weeks ago), but the corn tortillas, homemade salsa, and taco fillings were delicious. <br/><br/>If you're in Austin and have an afternoon off, definitely head over to Granny's and get at least three tacos. You won't regret it!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,371,"If you are in Austin or live in Austin and you don't go here you are a complete fool. <br/><br/>The mole chilaquiles taco is quite possibly the best taco I've ever had. <br/><br/>Also the broccoli, egg and cheese breakfast taco was surprisingly good, as was the chorizo egg and cheese.<br/><br/>Handmade flour tortillas are delicious. Will try the corn next time.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,372,I go to granny's tacos food truck every weekend and it never disappoints.

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,378,"FINALLY! ESTA MILAGRO GRANDE! My husband and I had pretty much given up on finding good Mexican food in Houston and didn't think we'd find a good authentic place in all of Texas(besides El Paso) at this point. This is a serious matter for us since my husband's Mexican American and we have never had bad Mexican food while growing up in southern California. Stopped here for breakfast this morning and this was my first time not being disappointed by so-called ""Mexican"" food in Texas. I ordered the Chilaquiles Mole taco and the cactus, egg, and cheese taco. My husband ordered the Hayley bowl. Everything was so delicious and wonderfully actually Mexican food and in the case of the bowl great Mexican fusion. It was in no way Tex Mex crap! We would've immediately ordered more if we both weren't so full. Muchas gracias por todo Granny's Tacos!",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,403,"Amazing food, genuine people. Warm smiles, warm conversation, and warm fresh tortillas. As an longtime Austin resident, we take BBQ and tacos very passionately here. The owners of Granny's put current taco contenders to shame. A new face to streets of Austin, Granny's creations are incredibly fresh and of high quality. Their corn tortillas are inexplicably delicious; fresh and light, and yet could almost be confused with flour. If you're looking for a menu recommendation, heads towards the chicken mole. A professional mix of grilled chicken, peppers, and mole sauce, so that neither flavor over compensates the others. Migas are your next stop; a packed breakfast blend which mixes perfectly with one of their three homemade salsas. <br/><br/>In summary, please don't visit this taco wunderkind mom'n'pop food truck...<br/><br/>'Cause then I'll have to wait longer for my tacos.",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,433,"So Pueblo Viejo is good for street tacos, but this little place tucked in next to Vintage Heart Coffee is AMAZING. Get the Carne Asada tacos and the Veggie Tacos with refried beans. Absolutely awesome. Plus they are open at hours when most trucks are closed. We visited at 3:00 on a Tuesday and they were more than happy to make us delicious food. The truck is run by a husband and wife team who are just awesome. So good. We'll most certainly be back.",5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,437,"My husband and I tried this taco truck today on a whim, and we were so happy we did. My husband asked the teen taking our order if they had a basic steak taco, and the guy turned to the woman cooking and said, ""Grandma, do we have a regular steak taco?"" All the feels. I thought it was adorable and wanted so badly for the tacos to be awesome so we could come back and support a family business....they did not disappoint! <br/>Fresh, loaded, delicious! The sauces are fantastic also. We got the chorizo taco and fajita steak taco and I'm hooked.

Only drawback was it took a while to cook, but in her defense, Abuela had around 20 tacos to cook for all of us! I am gonna come back in sweat pants and eat until I bust.",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,454,This taco stand is worth the walk if you are staying near the convention center. Breakfast tacos are just amazing- and the fresh salsa kept in the cooler on the side of the truck is a great touch.,5 star rating

Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,460,"Ran by a friendly couple, Granny's Taco serves delicious Mexican food for reasonable prices. They even have mole, a kind of brown sauce that's difficult to find even in Austin's expansive taco scene. My favorite thing to get is the chilaquiles taco with mole! There's outdoors seating and some convenient parking next to it. The wait time is a little long, but you can chill at the nearby Vintage Hearts Coffee Shop while waiting!",5 star rating
Granny's Tacos,5fI9ZzqzRLnMNYoTMjUGGQ,461,"I had two tacos here for the first time today and was beyond impressed. I grew up in Southern California and visited family in Mexico every year so I know authentic tacos and ingredients when I taste them. I'm a corn over flour guy till I die so if you're one of those Tex mex chuy's dumpster divers you might not appreciate the lack of quesooo on these incredible tacos. First one I had the pleasure of eating was the chilaquiles taco with mole, onion, chicken, and Mexican cheese on a homemade corn tortilla. 5 stars. One of those tacos that's so good it brings back childhood memories and all the sights and sounds that come along with it. <br/>The next is the Abuela Taco with shredded pork, adobo sauce, pico, and avocado. Similar to an al pastor but way better than any al pastor taco I've ever had. 5 stars. They've barely been open a year and this place is currently the best kept secret in austin. Come here now before you have to wait forever to snag a taste of this gift from the taco gods.",5 star rating

Although these tacos aren't yet the talk of the town, they are certainly jaw-droppingly mouth-watering and buzz-worthy! Their tacos are served fresh and you can taste the authentic love that went into making them... from the homemade corn tortillas, awesome array of veggies (yes, add that cactus or broccoli to your taco!), and the salsas made with the perfect consistency and degree of spicy- orange-red habanero, lime green salsa verde, etc...Not to mention their MOLE sauce again... AH. the tacos are so special you can't resist licking your fingers after eating them with your hands. And, its a family-run joint. You can catch Granny's son eating a taco with his kids on a rainy day.
