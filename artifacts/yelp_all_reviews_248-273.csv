OneTaco,1,Found myself looking for a way to spend my day as I visited Austin. Looked up  tacos  cause... Austin. And this place happened to be 5 mins away. How fortunate for me because turns out this place has some unique fulfilling and great tasting choices on their menu   Instagram- bite4_ray
OneTaco,2,Came in this quiet afternoon  looking for a good place to eat and do some work on my device with WiFi. 3 very friendly employees assisted me quickly and respectfully. Loved the Carne Asada taco  Definitely great place to find and will be back. Thank you   Edit- I came again today because of yesterday s experience  and change of feelings and taste. Not very welcoming. I thought I had seen an advertisement for a free chips and salsa  so I mentioned it. Granted  it review and go a few places  the chair stated to grab my phone to show her. Understandable. I didn t and apologize  ordered the El pastor which unfortunately very small and disappointing for the  . I had to ask then to heat up in microwave which was done without a problem. If I was working here I would have made a returning customer a fresh one.   I will try out again sometime in the future. Thanks.
OneTaco,3,I love that the vegetarian options have their own spot  easy to find and quick to read then choose. Everything I ve gotten here has been delicious. I also love to make my own sauce by mixing sauce flavors into the 1oz cups  topping them with the tiny lids and tossing them into my to go bag before heading out.   The few staff I ve talked to seemed friendly and quick. The restaurant clean and kept up.   I will keep coming here.
OneTaco,4,The pastor tacos are delicious    Best pastor I ve tried so far    I totally recommend
OneTaco,5,taco tuesday   I always see onetaco whenever I go grocery shopping at HEB and we finally decided to stop by afterwards for dinner. it just so happened to be tuesday so the al pastor tacos were  2  I usually don t like al pastor but these were delicious  they include a slice of pineapple and I thought it was a great touch.   there s plenty of seating inside and outside. the staff is really friendly. I definitely recommend.
OneTaco,6,Dropped in after a grocery trip to HEB and was thrilled  Great tacos are easy to find in Austin  but appreciated the wider menu and bright  colorful decor.  Got the carne asada  pollo asado  and yucateco - chips  queso and street corn. Everything was fantastic   Salsas definitely spicy. No idea what the yucateco was  except pork  but it was delicious and kinda smoky. I didn t realize they d been on diners  drive ins and dives - but that s definitely why I got that taco  Next time I ll get the gringa.   Great service too - funny and helpful  definitely a great job all around. So convenient  only a bit pricey  only reason for marking it at 4 stars 
OneTaco,7,Relatively decent breakfast tacos. Tortillas were good. Seasoning and salsas were a let down and don t compare to somewhere like Veracruz but you don t have a long wait.
OneTaco,8,Love this place   It smelled so good when we walked in and the staff was so nice  Clean and not a dirty table in sight  Food came out really fast and was absolutely delicious  Such a great experience
OneTaco,9,Absolutely love this place. Just give it all a try and find what is your favorite thing. Because I liked to many things to say just one in particular thing. I ve had breakfast and dinner there and both meals were delicious.
OneTaco,10,It feels like we take out from here at least once a week during our HEB runs. The menu is really small but it has some thing for everyone. The Taco De Pollo Asado is my favorite with the chipotle sauce and burnt brown layer of cheese  I always add jalape os for an extra kick.   They have a variety of Mexican sodas to choose from and 3 types of salsas. Orders are made pretty quickly and service is really friendly.   I ll try the breakfast tacos and vegetarian options one of these days.
OneTaco,11,2 Veggie Tacos were ok Nachos were good but soggy  Ordered carryout maybe would be better in store.
OneTaco,12,I ve been fortunate enough to have had their breakfast tacos in the past thanks to a fellow employee who tended to be a bit  too  generous of bringing breakfast in for everyone at work but this was my first time trying their lunch menu   I got the Taco Norte and it did not disappoint.  Prepared fresh right in front of me  the guy working was nice and attentive  guiding me to the side refreshments station if I needed any extra sauce. Ah man  the FLAVOR in the meat was incredible. Super juicy with the perfect combination of fried cheese  shredded cheese  and pico.  I thought I would need two tacos but one surprisingly did the job just fine. While the menu was small  they do a nice job of keeping quality consistent so hopefully it stays that way.    Tacos were a bit out of my price range  but what taco isn t under  4 these days  but I guess that s the way it goes sometimes 
OneTaco,13,I frequent OneTaco fairly often  The Taco Trompo Tuesday deal is definitely super worth  It used to be  2 for the Al Pastor and Gringo tacos  but recently they raised it to  2.50  which honestly ain t a bad deal either. Also  it seems they took down all the Taco Tuesday ads posters that had been posted around the establishment previously...hopefully the deal doesn t go away anytime soon   The Gringo tacos are litty mctitty  D It s got the same stuff as the Al Pastor--yummy seasoned pork  onions  cilantro  pineapple  and a lime slice on the side BUT they add in some nicely crisped cheese that s fresh off the grill  And I m not even a cheese person  but the Gringo taco is just  so good  And such great value too  I like their green salsa...there are two different green salsas  and one is supposed to be spicier than the other  but I can t really tell them apart in the bottles that they have laid out  so I just take a random pick..and it s always been pretty good 
OneTaco,14,Every time I ve ordered through here they never send my drinks   this will be the 3rd time I don t get the drinks I order   My order was wrong and I tried to call them and there s no answer and can t get a hold of anyone   I specified I wanted corn tortillas they were made in flour   there s no following of directions in the order       It s ridiculous       What s the point in writting specifications on the order if they won t be followed   will not be ordering from this location anymore and it s sad because I loved this place      Very disappointed
OneTaco,15,I ve been avoiding this place. I thought it was like Torchy s or Taco Deli  white-washed   creative  tacos that lack flavor and aren t filling and usually overpriced   and boy  was I wrong. They remind me of the tacos I get back home in Corpus Christi  full and robust. Definitely making my way back there to try the rest of their menu.   I ordered two I double bacons  total 9.37.  More than I would normally pay for tacos  but worth it. 
OneTaco,16,I come here every Tuesday during Taco Tuesday...They have excellent service and delicious food...I highly recommend this place...
OneTaco,17,This used to be my go to taco spot but in a year it s changed dramatically. Their prices have gone up again and again  they ve changed the menu  and some of my favorite items are gone. If you re gonna go  make sure you eat in. If you order to go your whole order gets squished. It s back to looking for a taco truck for me.
OneTaco,18,This place is a hit  100  recommended   Menu is small  but that just means the food they carry really packs a punch of savory and delicious flavors  They have pork  beef  chicken  AND vegetarian options    When I saw the older Mexican band photos posted on the wall I knew this place had to be good   Friendly and helpful staff  and I seriously have to say THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS  with bottled Mexican sodas  beers  and a soda fountain that dispenses the most crisp tasting Sprite ever    Masks required  small but spacious place  clean and clutter free 
OneTaco,19,Really great authentic tacos. The menu isn t large but every taco on there is so full of flavor. I especially loved how they fry the cheese on top so there is a nice crispy crunch to it. Their Agua Fresca and Horchata are also solid drink choices if you are feeling thirsty.   Keep an eye out for their taco Tuesday deals 
OneTaco,20,Most authentic taco place in Austin  coming from a Mexican . Love the pastor  Always craving OneTaco.
OneTaco,21,Delicious quesadillas and tacos some of the best tacos in Austin. Great value and taste 
OneTaco,22,The Al pastor is cut right there and assembled to order. I had one  then went right back up to the counter to order a second.
OneTaco,23,Our favorite go to on weekends  The flavors are so delicious. The staff is nice and work efficiently. It s a must try   Especially the pollo asado and gringa tacos 
OneTaco,24,This was our first time trying it out  and I don t know how I d never heard of One Taco before. It s a no frills tacqueria with a solid menu of classics. We took advantage of the  2 Tuesday special and got tacos al pastor  which were just right. I also liked the Bandera taco  which was very flavorful. The queso is good  standard melty cheese and salsa  but not life-changing. We ll definitely be back for a tasty and reasonably priced lunch.
OneTaco,25,Delicious breakfast tacos  You can taste the tortillas and sauces are made in house. We had the Buenos Dias and the Barbocoa and they did not disappoint  Also very quick service if you re in a rush   
OneTaco,26,very very delicious tacos super clean and friendly  the pastor is very nice marinated and the bistec tacos mmmm are also a must try with the gringas
OneTaco,27,I love coming to this place  It s a great location right next to where I live so it s super convenient. My go to s are the al pastor taco and all of the breakfast tacos. Also  Tuesdays are the best because the al pastor tacos are  2 
OneTaco,28,I went there yesterday with my friend really good quality margarita is great  the tacos are good quality and the staff are very nice  
OneTaco,29,They re my favorite as far as a chain they are really fresh  have a lot of choices and I always get the al pastor and a variety of tacos all are very tasty  I always get corn tortillas abs theirs don t taste like they just got them at the store  they re a very nice texture
OneTaco,30,This place is so underrated    One of my favorite taco shops in Austin because they make the Al pastor tacos on the trompo. On Tuesday they do taco Tuesday and they are  2 for regular sized tacos    Not the mini size that most places do . I have also tried their breakfast tacos and they are delicious   
OneTaco,31,While I do like the tacos themselves. When I place orders for certain sauces  I never seem to get the correct amount or they give me different sauces entirely. I rarely ever get what I ordered with my tacos.
OneTaco,32,Visited for the 1st yesterday  amp  got the veggie taco. This came with grilled veggies. I only ordered 2 tacos  amp  it took almost 15min. The dine in was not crowded at all. By the time I received my food the tacos were cold. The total was  13.53 which included a bag of chips   salsa. I checked my bank statement and One Taco charged me  17.23 which was unauthorized. I didn t leave a tip so why they charged my card extra without my knowing is unknown. I definitely won t be visiting this establishment anymore.
OneTaco,33,I ve eaten at One Taco often...and have loved everything about the menu  service and quality of food.  The ONLY REASON I m giving this trip 4 stars is the steak tacos were very gristly.  I ve had these before and have always been pleased.    Thanks for opening this new location      Well be back often.
OneTaco,34,Stopped for a quick breakfast on a Sunday morning. Restaurant was clean  staff was friendly  and tacos were good. Small place but it seems most people take their tacos to go. I would stop by again for a quick bite if i was in the area.
OneTaco,35,1st time eating here.  For some reason came here instead of In N Out.  Good decision.  Two Tacos and Horchata were all amazing.   Without knowing anything about this place  I didn t come with any expectations and I am no expert on authentic Tacos  but I am now kicking myself cause I ve been eating at Torchy s and Taco Deli for years and these Tacos are much tastier.
OneTaco,36,Great taco spot  Definitely coming back. My favorite was the asada with chorizo. Al pastor was good too
OneTaco,37,Awesome breakfast tacos and great service. The place was clean and staff wore masks. There s an outside patio with a few picnic tables  there s plenty of inside seating as well. We ordered the Jefe breakfast taco  I  bacon breakfast taco  and the barbacoa taco that was served on a corn tortilla. The barbacoa was the best 
OneTaco,38,Absolutely love this place  The quality and price aligns perfectly  I ordered a barbacoa taco and an I  Bacon taco and let me tell you  they re HUGE  The salsa is delicious and the agua de melon was pretty good. One Taco has managed to find the perfect balance between an authentic and Austin-ish taco spot. 9 10
OneTaco,39,Not good  I door dashed my order.. they made my doordasher wait about 30 min then my driver arrived and dropped off in 9 min. My tacos were cold  the nachos were supposed to have been Bean nachos and it only had beans on 3 pieces of chips. Never ordering from here again  my stomach is sick  
OneTaco,40,I love One Taco  amp  I was so excited when this location opened up  I ordered the Taquiza De Pastor like always which is 5 small tacos  without cilantro   amp  instead I got 1 taco. Pure laziness  and not worth 9 dollars for 1 taco   I am extremely frustrated with this location.
OneTaco,41,Very good tacos for a good price   Love the salsa with avocados  This is a weekly or bi weekly visit due to how quick it is.
OneTaco,42,Food was not impressive at all. I had a vegetarian taco. Not what I expected. Hubby got Mexican street corn and El Pastor taco. Meat was dry. Sorry One Taco  I hope food will be better if I have a return trip.
OneTaco,43,Friendly service  fresh off the grill. This taqueria is authentic. Taquiza de Asada - squeeze some lime and a touch of salt - perfect street taco 
OneTaco,44,This spot is getting busy  the word must be getting out   All the chicken taco are legit  and they have plenty of outdoor seating. even when there s a line they move you through really quickly 
OneTaco,45,I loved this place.  Went for breakfast tacos at 11 am and was not disappointed.  I had the blanco verde which was egg whites  jalape os and avocado.   Yum   The tortillas are made fresh.   It was a good sized portion.  My son had the I  bacon taco and said it was full of bacon.   We both then had the pancake taco which is a pancake with scrambled eggs  bacon and hash browns in it like a taco.   You then put maple syrup on it and it is amazing   Will definitely go back again when in Austin.
OneTaco,46,The place overall is clean  amp  looks well kept. My fianc   amp  I were eager to try a new restaurant together  amp  found this  gem . The music was nice  amp  upbeat. The cashier was a huge help sweet  even. We ordered  amp  sat down at a nearby table to wait for our order. I looked over  amp  noticed NOT A SINGLE PERSON WAS WEARING GLOVES AS THEY WERE MAKING OUR FOOD. I m talking about scooping the carne asada out of an insert with a serving bowl  amp  putting that same bowl back into the insert  amp  touching our food with bare hands    I was DISGUSTED. I m a food manager  amp  what I witnessed was horrible. Not to mention one of the employees coughed into her hand  amp  didn t even wash her hands after.  amp  yes  I did get a refund  amp  let them know exactly why I wanted one.
OneTaco,47,We ordered the Relax Taco  Bandera and the Chicken Taco. They were dry  and lacked in flavor.  Will not be getting these again but open to trying their breakfast tacos.
OneTaco,48,Have only tried the Breakfast Taco s and they are Great. Nice variety with both green and red salsa.  I m looking forward to stopping in for lunch to try the full menu... after I work my way through all of the Breakfast options.
OneTaco,49,Tacos are loaded with lots of yummy food  A place to try  You won t be disappointed. 
OneTaco,50,Just moved in nearby and saw this taco joint by HEB. My girlfriend and I tried 4 different tacos and the queso. They were all great  The hot salsa that came with the tacos was good too. I will be back for sure.
OneTaco,51,Visiting from Florida on vacation and saw it as we passed by and looked it up. It was featured on Diners  Drive-Ins and Dives and thought we d give it a try. Chips and guacamole surprised us in that we got a plastic bag of prepackaged chips that were really plain but were warm. The guac was bland and we had to add salt to give it taste. I ordered what Guy Fieri ordered but was disappointed that it was also bland and the meat was dry. My son ordered the steak tacos which he liked but to me they looked bland  steak  onions and cilantro  doesn t include cheese or any kind of sauce. My daughter didn t like hers at all and we ordered her another since she was hungry still. She got the carne asada which she did love but  4.50 for one taco seemed kind of pricey. My wife ordered the cactus taco which she liked. Overall the food was mediocre at best and typically the way I get honest feedback from my family  as they don t want to feel like I wasted my money  is to ask would you want to come back   The answer was no.
Jefes Street Tacos,1,Some solid tacos hidden within west campus. Not too pricey and still really delicious.  I ve never really had Carnitas  until coming here but these set a high expectation for them. The Asada and pastor are also really good  The lady in the front is always super friendly.  I can t wait to visit again 
Jefes Street Tacos,2,The girl taking out order has a stink face and bad attitude I m so upset about this and I m not even a Karen
Jefes Street Tacos,3,Delicious food  First time eating taco in United States. Nice experience  Barbacoa Street Taco.
Jefes Street Tacos,4,These tacos are extremely underrated. Some of the best tacos I ve had in Austin. It is also very affordable. Just  6 for 3 tacos.
Jefes Street Tacos,5,Food Truck Lot in downtown Austin just minutes from University of Texas off of Guadalupe Street.   3 street tacos for   6 - Carna Asada  Barbacoa and Carnitas. I prefer the Carna Asada and the Barbacoa and purchased a bottle of mexican coke.   Simple quick and good and yes pretty reasonable on the pocket.
Jefes Street Tacos,6,Get the quesadillas with pastor  Dip them in the hot sauce they give you  a match made in h-e-a-v-e-n 
Jefes Street Tacos,7,I was on campus visiting UT McCombs and knew I needed to try some Austin tacos. It was unseasonably cold so I didn t want to walk too far -Jefe s was perfect because it was directly next to campus and sits in a little patio with other food options - a food truck for Taiwanese street food  Greek  Bahn Mi  and more. I ordered three tacos  barbacoa  pastor  and brisket. They were all AMAZING. I opted for avocado on top  but truly the meats were the star of the show. It was cold outside and the tacos were hot  juicy  flavorful and delicious. They were the perfect amount of fatty and the corn tortillas were warm and lightly grilled. If I am ever on the UT campus again I will for sure be back   The people working there were also so friendly and the service was quick. These were some of my favorite tacos in Texas.
Jefes Street Tacos,8,Got the  5 gordita with pastor  and with the green salsa it is the right amount of heat and flavor  Also  for the price  it s so much food   Lastly   but not leastly   the woman working there was super nice and the wait was nothing 
Jefes Street Tacos,9,I ordered the Barbacoa tacos and they were amazing   My husband ordered carne asada  carnitas and Barbacoa tacos and he said they were good but the best one was Barbacoa. I tried the carnitas taco and it felt a little dry and I got a bite of my husbands asada quesadilla and the asada was ok it wasn t my favorite. I highly recommend the Barbacoa as choice of meat  so juicy and tender. Last thing the salsas are amazing I love the green one  it was definitely spicy but what s Mexican food without a little spice   Lol
Jefes Street Tacos,10,Holy Mary mother lord   Gonna start out with the barbacoa street taco.   On corn with cilantro and onion    It s so good  that it s absolute pain to drive to your destination to eat it.  The barbacoa is as lean as they can get it.  Obviously they picked out as much fat as possible      Next is the pastor street taco on corn with cilantro and white chopped onion  WOW   Holy mother    So good  the pastor is just right    I m eating the taco with green salsa and its enormously great    Let me finish then on to the next taco review   I lied   I m back on the pastor taco and it s equally as good with the orange red salsa    Has the perfect texture  Jefe s tacos is the shit and I m giving it 5 stars for sure.   Ok I m gonna finishing pastor then rate the carne asada   The carna asada meat is perfect.  Splash some lime on there.   Holy cow    This is what I think of when I think of street tacos    This is my first time and I rate the three tacos I had in the order I reviewed them       Glad I stubbled across Jefe s 
Jefes Street Tacos,11,These tacos slayed. The line moved quickly  and the guy was extremely friendly. He gave me foil to take the tacos to go as well as a napkin and a cup of salsa. These are the truest street tacos near campus  and the 3 tacos for  6 is a sweet deal. I had both the carne asada and pastor  and both were delicious 
Jefes Street Tacos,12,I ve been stopping by Jefe s Street Tacos Trailer every now and then for the past year or so. The street tacos are an absolute steal for  5 or  6  depending on if you use the Hooked app  for 3 tacos. I m a fan of their carne asada and pastor meats. Their sauces also pair really well with the tacos  adding a great kick.   My only beef with this place is how early they close. They shut down around 2 or 3 every day. As a college student  by the time I was out of classes  or out of bed   the trailer was already closed. That s obviously a personal problem. But  I would love to be able to eat these tacos for dinner sometimes    All in all  the food is great and absolutely worth the price  the owners are very nice and helpful to their customers  and I ll continue to pop over here every now and then.
Jefes Street Tacos,13,I love this place. Thank God for the Co-op Food Court. He hopes to stay here as long as he can. I love the tacos here and my friends do too  Real  authentic Mexican food   The manager of this particular trailer is superb. Since I never have time to eat my food there with my busy schedule of class and work right after  he s always been more than happy to oblige with my to-go requests. Today  I asked him to wrap each taco in foil so I can take it on the bus  hiding my food so they don t make me throw it away  ya know    and I really appreciate him so I tipped him over 50     He s sad to see me go since I m graduating but I told him I ll still be around since I have a job downtown     The tacos are amazing. I love the carnitas and it is my guilty pleasure. Not bland. Avocado is fresh  Plus  your corn tortillas are always doubled up. I ve experienced some Tacodeli mishaps with corn tortillas...so I m glad I don t have this issue here.   I love this place. I really do and I hope you do too.
Jefes Street Tacos,14,Great Tacos  3 for  6  loads of meat  double tortilla. Fast service. Located just behind the CO-OP.
Jefes Street Tacos,15,They ain t all that. Quite small. The pastor leaves something to be desired. The asada is better. Price per value isn t worth it. I ll save my dineros for Rosalita s Al Pastor on Riverside.
Jefes Street Tacos,16,Plain and simple   tasty street tacos. Affordable  delicious  convenient. Smiling service and a tasty plate.
Jefes Street Tacos,17,These tacos are the most authentic Mexican tacos I ve found on the drag  I m originally from a border town so it s neat that I found something comparable to the tacos back at home. Lots of meat and they re reasonably priced. The only thing about this location  food truck  is that sometimes it doesn t follow the listed hours. I ve also had their quesadillas  they were delicious and their salsas are so good 
Jefes Street Tacos,18,I tried their carnitas quesadilla   6.00  and it was ready pretty quickly and tasted just the way it should.  I liked it because they skip the grilled veggies and pico de gallo that so many other places think belong in a quesadilla.  This is just meat and cheese  and that s the way I like it.  The person who took my order was very friendly  too.  I ll go back anytime I m near the Co-op or the Drag and looking for a quick and delicious quesadilla.
Jefes Street Tacos,19,Over rated. Flavors on my torta were decent but bread was completely falling apart and some of the meat was tough and chunky.
Jefes Street Tacos,20,Sorry  but these tacos just aren t very good. I got the carnitas  barbacoa  and pastor. They looked legit  they were the right size  and they had the right amount of onion cilantro  so I was excited... But the carnitas were pretty dry and none of the meats were very well seasoned. I almost never pour salsa on a taco because they typically don t need it. But each taco was very lacking in flavor. These were just super  meh . A disappointing taco experience in such a taco-heavy city.
Jefes Street Tacos,21,jefes has been a Thursday lunch staple for me and my coworkers for over a year. never disappointed  always fresh. this is real Mexican street tacos  nothing adulterated or fancy. I highly recommend the street tacos on corn tortillas for an authentic experience 
Jefes Street Tacos,22,Just discovered Jefe s from a friend s recommendation. This are some of the best tacos in town. My favorites are the carnitas and barbacoa on flour. So fast and great flavor 
Jefes Street Tacos,23,Fantastic  Absolutely my favorite place to eat on the Drag. Their pastor is excellent. They are super friendly and very fast. Whenever I have ordered from any other food truck there I regret it because they are SO MUCH FASTER to serve than any of the others.
Jefes Street Tacos,24,I stop by everyday to get their amazing Barbacoa quesadillas  The amount of cheese Barbacoa onions and cilantro is perfect. The man and woman who run the trailer are always so nice and honest about the food. I highly recommend you try this place you won t be disappointed
Jefes Street Tacos,25,Delicious tacos. Really nice customer service. The green sauce is probably the best part.
Jefes Street Tacos,26,The tacos were amazing     I went with a friend and we loved it. Great taste at a good price 
Jefes Street Tacos,27,Authentic Mexican food  I had the gordita with carne asada and it made me so happy to have real Mexican food on campus besides Burrito Factory. Both places are great.
Jefes Street Tacos,28,I had been wanting to try this food truck for a long time. Now I feel dumb for waiting so long  Hooked had a deal that was  5 for three street tacos and a drink  usually it s still  6 so pretty great price. Now with the quality  it s an even better price. VERY authentic and homemade tacos. The cilantro and onions were fresh and the meat  I had chicken fajita and carne asada  was savory and cooked just like a taco should be.   The homemade hot sauces were delicious as well. Juan was manning the food truck and was friendly and very welcoming. Jefe  Street Tacos  you will have my business and I recommend this food truck to everyone in Austin 
Jefes Street Tacos,29,i love getting tacos here   so convenient since it s right next to UT and it s a great price for a lot of food
Jefes Street Tacos,30,So freakin good  Just had it for lunch and reminds me of the tacos I use to eat back in the late 90 s in Mexico after the clubs.
Jefes Street Tacos,31,Really good. I had the taco special - 3 tacos for  6.  One carne asada  one carnitas  one pastor. All 3 were good. You  yes you  should eat here.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,1,Tacos are to die for. Trying the gordita tonight. Blink and you would miss this place. Such a good place though. One thing to note  they only take cash  so make sure you come prepped.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,2,Lets taco  bout it   On this occasion my friend Jimmy and I happened to visit this taco and pupusa stand that is located next to a Shop n and Save store  this is convenient for two reasons  although the food stand sells canned soft drinks   the variety of drinks that there is in the convenience store is much greater  and secondly because of the option to withdraw money in cash since Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos only accepts cash  unfortunately this is the only reason why we could not give it the highest rating.  Our order consisted of chicken fajita tacos and a Loroco Pupusa with cheese  this accompanied with green and red sauce that were not so spicy but had a very good flavor and could not miss the curtido for the pupusas  honestly the food options It was within what we expected with this type of establishment where Salvadoran food is mostly offered with options of snacks from other places  very good and everything fresh since it is prepared at the moment  the prices of this type of establishment are still very affordable and I really recommend it  since we noticed during our experience that most of the people who came to buy at this establishment were regular customers  so this was a very good sign.  En esta ocasi n mi amigo Jimmy y yo nos toc  visitar este puesto de tacos y pupusas que se encuentra ubicado a un lado de una tienda de Shop n and Save  esto es conveniente por dos razones  aunque el puesto de comida vende refrescos en lata  la variedad de bebidas que hay en La tienda de conveniencia es mucho mayor  y segundo por la opci n de retirar dinero en efectivo ya que Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos solo acepta efectivo  desafortunadamente esta es la  nica raz n por la cual no pudimos darle la mayor calificaci n.  Nuestra orden consisti  en tacos de fajita de pollo y una Pupusa de Loroco con queso  esto acompa ado con salsa verde y roja que no estaban tan picosas pero ten an un muy buen sabor y tampoco podia faltar el curtido para las pupusas  honestamente las opciones de comida fue dentro de lo que esperamos con este tipo de establecimientos donde mayormente se ofrece comida salvadore a con opciones de antojitos de otros lugares  muy bueno y todo fresco ya que se prepara en el momento  los precios de este tipo de establecimiento siguen siendo muy asequibles y la verdad lo recomiendo  ya que notamos durante nuestra experiencia que la mayor a de personas que llegaban a comprar a este establecimiento eran clientes regulares as  que esto fue una muy buena se al.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,3,Got a pupusa  Loroco con queso  and a taco  lengua . Both were really good and piping hot. Think they were  2.50 each. Not bad at all. Decent portion for the taco too.  Cash only.  Don t think the person who took my order spoke English so if you don t speak Spanish I recommend using google.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,4,Carnitas on corn and Al Pastor on corn  Phenomenal  I Drive by the taco truck at least three times a week and this is the first time I stopped  Freaking delicious  I also got three tree for tacos on flour... I should ve got a dozen... Will definitely be coming back 
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,5,Such a great place for tacos and pupusas on the side of the road   I had a chicken fajita taco and a frijol con queso pupusa. Both were really delicious  and had me wanting more. The tortillas were so hot and seemed really fresh   This stand is cash only  which isn t the most convenient  but it s pretty cheap  so it s not hard to find a few dollars to pay for the meal.   There s a little area off to the side with picnic tables so you can eat there  too 
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,6,Everything about this place was terrible . They didn t speak English but that s not a problem. but I think that played a big part in why my order got messed up not once but twice. Then they still didn t get it right even when someone translated for me but I didn t feel like going back for a third time. Tacos was disgusting. Dry as shit. I got like 2 pieces of cilantro total   didn t get cheese like I asked. Didn t get cilantro on the side like I asked. Asked for my beef tacos to have CHEESE AND ONIONS   I got cilantro and onions. Went back to reorder and got just cheese like wtf. Chicken was terrible tasting   you can just look at the pictures and tell . I can not make this shit up. I m mad asf right now cause I had to do the MOST for these tacos and they were 0 10. Even my kids didn t like them.. and they eat any damn thing.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,7,Salvadoran food trucks with pretty good pupusas. Not the best I ve had but they re pretty consistent. Haven t tried the Mexican food or Honduran food  they have tajadas  on their menu since I can get those at other places  see my other reviews .  If you re exploring pupusas around Austin and are  understandably  not impressed  check this place out.   Tip  the location is unclear. Here s the address  2204 Woodland Ave.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,8,This place is just ok. Doesn t live up to the hype by fellow yelpers. Ordered a Pupusa and a beef and chicken taco. Both the beef and chicken tacos were dry. Not much in the way of flavor. The Pupusa was ok.  On to the next.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,9,This was supposed to be a chicken  quesadilla  but it was more of a chicken taco because there was barely any cheese at all and the chicken had a weird taste. I do not recommend the chicken  quesadillas  but the pupusas on the other hand are pretty good.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,10,I had a beef sope  amp  a bean  amp  cheese pupusa. Both were delicious. I ll definitely be back 
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,11,Love quesadillas   Theirs are great and the red and green salsas are wonderfully spicy  Highly recommend. We also tried the bean  amp  cheese pupusa which was delicious. They serve it with a mix of cabbage that provided the perfect crunch. Try it out  Can t wait to go back.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,12,Great taco truck on the East side of Austin. They have Salvadoran food as well as pretty great tacos  so they definitely got it all. My wife and I tried a myriad of items  and to say the least they were pretty good.  What we had in order of what we liked  1. Barbacoa taco on corn - best barbacoa I ve had of all the taco places I ve tried in Austin. It s a flavor bomb that s definitely on the heavier side but it s succulent  tender  meaty and delicious.  2. Calabaza con queso pupusa - lighter pupusa that has been well griddled and stuffed with melty cheese. A little of that pickled slaw goes a long way to giving a balanced bite. 3. Chicharron con queso pupusa - I was expected pork cracklings but its just pork. Not as flavorful as I would have expected  but if you want meat  its the way to go. Also filled with melty cheese goodness  so can t go wrong.   4. Al pastor taco on corn - it s definitely much spicier than other al pastor I ve had in town  but not in a bad way. You probably just don t expect it from an al pastor taco though. 5. Yucca fries - there s pork niblets scattered throughout but this one is a bit disappointing as the fries just taste like grease. I don t recommend personally.  Stick to the tacos and pupusas and you ll be fine. It s light on your wallet  so you can order and try a lot  especially if you go with other people.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,13,Great place to get good Hispanic food that s fast and far from disappointing. Definitely go here for a lunch break. It s a little hidden where it s parked but worth looking for.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,14,This was my secomd time at this stand. Its a little off the main road. And in an area with a lot of competition. But its pretty good  Lots of flavor and not too small of tacoz either. Have noe tried the Beef and Chicken Fajita  the Barbacoa and the a Pastor. The Pastor and Beef were run of the mill but everything else impressed me.  The hot sauce was much runnier on the second visit so thats been a little inconsistent.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,15,Great Pupusas  Great price  Great service and my food came out in a timely manner. These Pupusas definitely were up to par and I would recommend trying them out for anyone looking for authentic Salvadorian food.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,16,Okay  so I don t know if this is the same trailer as the one on Oltorf or a different one  in which case it should probably get a different review home . In any case  despite the pitfalls of partly ordering through an eight-year-old translator and partly working between my deeply questionable Spanish and the proprietor s even more questionable English  we ended up pretty happy here. I discovered pupusas pretty recently from my friend of Guatemalan ancestry  and my wife and I were pleased to discover that Los Ramos makes them  now bringing the Austin taco-truck-to-pupusa-truck ratio up to 1 167  1. I could describe a pupusa as a Central American taco  but that would be a stupid concession to my poor Central American food vocabulary  as well as not very helpful. Let s just say that they re hot round torta-like things made fresh on a grill with toppings  although that doesn t really get at it either. I give up  try them--they re awesome.  I accidentally got a bowl of shrimp soup  thinking that it being in the  plates  section of the menu meant that it was a combo plate with two sides. Probably because  see disclaimer about bad Spanish  I confused  calido   hot  with  caldo   soup . It was delicious soup  though  if a bit messy to eat at the nearby picnic table with limited napkins. Hilarity ensued.  In any case  very cheap  filling  delicious food  great  central North Loop location  very nice people who will not make fun of your very poor reading skills in other languages. We ll definitely try them again.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,17,Salvadoran tacos  tortas  gorditas  pupusas  hamburgers  and various Salvadoran dishes like plantains con crema with retried beans   10 . Delicious tacos. Cuban torta was a little weird with an extra grilled hot dog in it. I would order it without it. The ladies who take the to-go orders tend to speak Mainly Spanish but I have been able to get my orders across just fine. The tacos taste like Mexican tacos so I don t see the difference but I m not complaining. They re good  Beef fajita is the same like bistec tacos with onion and cilantro. I ve also tried the chicken fajita  Barbados  pastor  and Tripa tacos. All very good. I like that they re open until 1am. The hamburger is also solid and huge. Solid fast food. Affordable prices. Open til 1am. Go
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,18,This is a hidden gem in Austin  Their pupusas are authentic and freshly made. They also have a couple tables outside where you can enjoy your meal. Service is prompt and customer service was great. I am definitely coming here again 
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,19,We visited their fairly new location on 53rd street in front of a convenience store  which replaced Vegan Nom  which moved east to another 53rd street location .    Omigosh  delicious beef torta   Nice  fresh  crusty bread with tender strips of beef with avocado and pico de gallo.  My mouth waters just remembering it    Pupusas were hot  fresh off the grill with complimentary toppings and sauces.  Friendly lady and her young son made us feel right at home.  We enjoyed our feast at a nearby picnic table while capturing nearby Pok mon.  Can t wait to return for more.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,20,Bought 8. Should have trusted the reviews. Tasted like bleach and disinfectant. Worst I ve ever tried  and I have tried many Pupusas .
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,21,This is my new favorite taco truck on the east side now    I had the chicken fajita taco and frijol y queso pupusa. It was delicious and authentic. The girl working the window also cooked the food  she was very sweet and efficient and the food came out perfect    I ll definitely be coming back.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,22,Oh. My. Genie. These pupusas are dynamite.   This little  broken-down food truck is held in captivity between Riverside and Oltorf  on Burton Dr  in the center of the  hood. The real  hood. I mean  the  hood where you see stuff like in the movies.   Anyway - yes  the food is glorious. Go during the day  or with your posse if you re going after dark. You ll probably need to take a Spanish-speaking friend  because I don t believe the owners speak English. You can take me...
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,23,The best popular I ve had  but terrible experience. Paid for 2 popusas and I only received one. I could ve checked my order before living the place  but he even repeated the other  2 popusas  They need to pay more attention.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,24,The barbacoa tacos are absolutely amazing. The meat was cooked really well and tasted delicious. I definitely recommend this place.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,25,This place is rated 10 stars Legit   The taste is genuine and the slaw is amazing  I ve been going to a restaurant on 7th street for my Pupusa fix  but now I have a place that is closer to home literally and figuratively.  I recommend this super chill trailer to anyone who is wanting delicious pupusas  Oye Bos 
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,26,Amazingly delicious pupusas   Generously filled with your choice of cheese  beans  loroco  yummy plant   or chicharron.   My fianc  and I got all three and agreed they were the best. He is Salvadorian and said they reminded him of his grammas pupusas.   The cortido  cabbage with vinegar topping  has a nice spice to it.   We will be back     Go  amp  try them    Only  2 each- can t beat that 
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,27,The pastor tacos are pretty dang good. They had trouble telling me about the menu though due to their poor English. They were out of things on their menu too when I came  but still solid 4 for the tacos themselves.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,28,Finally found an authentic food truck in Austin. Hands down the best carne asada tacos 
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,29,Authentic Salvadoran pupusas.  2.50 for one pupusas was a fair price  especially given how well made they were. The pastor tacos were also generously filled  so you get your money s worth. I d definitely recommend if you re looking for some delicious food.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,30,This place served me authentic Salvadorian Pupusas   not fried but cooked the correct way which is heated on the griddle. The slaw was nice and spicy  usually is just vinegary but this nice twist had me sniffling. The area looks sketchy and I  was asked by a hungry customer if he could borrow my phone.... Other than that the place is legit and as I m writing this review I am salivating for another cheese and morocco Pupusa   vegetarian version   they do carry pork  bean  and chicharrin which is deep fried pork cheek.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,31,Spanish speaking only. Their pupusas are so amazing-definitely going back many more times
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,32,I have had Pupusas from different places around Austin and it s been very difficult to find a place that makes good ones. Having said that  this spot is pretty good.   My wife is salvadorian and she was impressed. The only reason I give it a 4 star and not 5 is that its like 2.50 for just one Pupusa which is expensive. But overall it was pretty good.   Normally their pretty greasy and that s what helps make them soo good but I did appreciate that this one wasn t as greasy and the flavor is authentic.   You should definitely try them out if your ever in the mood for some authentic Salvadorian Pupusa though I will say they don t have sauces since someone asked for sauce and the owner looked at the lady crazy because they don t have sauces  only salsas and spicy ones at that but really good. By the way it is in a bit of a sketchy area but hey once In a while is worth the trip.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,33,This tiny trailer is perfect for walkable and lovable food. The pupusas are as good as any I ve had  and the lady who runs the place is super sweet.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,34,Hard to find good Salvadorian food or true Hispanic latin food in Austin this place is nummy. Papusas and Tortas for us Mmm Mmm. Would have gotten 5 stars but I deducted for location and not given me enough cabbage mix. Lol
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,35,The breakfast burrito was solid. A diamond in the rough that is Burton Dr. Check this trailer out if you need a quick bite.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,36,I don t want to eat anything but their bean and cheese pupusas ever again. So delicious.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,37,The owners name is Anna and I ate the  Pupusa and it was delicious  Excellent atmosphere excellent food and excellent service.
Tacos y Pupusas Los Ramos,38,the food was ok... i ate the cheeseburger n fries combo n got sick.. soaked in grease.. yikes    
Con Todo,1,Absolutely amazing tacos  We stumbled upon it as we were heading to celis Brewery and we don t regret it one bit.  The menu has a list of tacos and tostadas with specials on the weekend. We chose the vegetarian options   tomato tostada  must try  amazing     the ceviche tostada and the squash taco. They were all so flavorful with quality ingredients  I can t wait to try all the other options next time. Highly recommend  this is a serious candidate that in the competition for best taco truck
Con Todo,2,If you are at the Celis Brewery  and in need of a bite to eat  Con Todo is right there in the parking lot  along with a couple of other food trucks. I really enjoyed these tacos and even my best friend from the RGV agreed that they were the most authentic that they ve tasted in Austin  bonus points for the handmade tortillas    The feedback I d share on Con Todo is while the taste and quality is amazing  the tacos are street style  smaller  and there was not much protein in the actual tacos. I felt for the price per taco that there was very little filling which was a bit disappointing.  Mollejas  Flavor was 10 10  salsa was delicious and perfect amount of spice  5 10 on the amount of actual protein in the taco.   Chori Papa Tostada  Flavor was 10 10  this was probably my favorite item because of the flavors and the overall quality of the house made tostada. Delicious    Barbacoa  Flavor was again 10 10 - you can really tell the beef was slow cooked with care  the flavor on the meats here will really impress you    All in all  for 6 tacos and 1 tostada  we spent about  40 for a very small amount of actual meat. I d like to try them again soon to see if this has changed but I d be hesitant to go here for anything other than a snack due to the cost.
Con Todo,3,Best tacos in Austin   In fact best taco I ve had anywhere really. They re made with love  The Mojellas Asada is THE best   Both sauce are wonderful and full of flavor 
Con Todo,4,We went to Con Todo because of their yelp reputation and went on a Sunday at around 4 pm. Upon arriving we were told That they were out of most menu options as it had been a long weekend. We ordered whatever it was they had left but we were ultimately disappointed.  No chicken  no beef  no tortillas at all. We had to settle for tostadas and veggie options in substitute for the meats.  Wish I had known they d be out of mostly everything. Oh well.
Con Todo,5,The slider truck said they weren t taking orders for 10-15 minutes so they could catch up on other orders so we decided to give this food truck a try.  We decided to share the chori-papa tostada. Food was ready within about two minutes of ordering and really yummy. The tostada shell is fried and puffy taco-like. Cheese is browned until crispy. Topped with guac  potatoes and chorizo. Really love the spicy red  orange  salsa.   Kind of expensive at  5.50 for a small tostada  the size of a street taco  but we would order it again 
Con Todo,6,I guess I ll do the honors here... Their tacos were pretty good. This little taco truck is in the parking lot of a very popular brewery  next to a few other offerings.  You order  you receive a little buzzer to let you know when it s ready  and then you wait... not too long  at least in our case.  We had three versions  with the most original being the chori papa tostada. I d say they were all pretty good. If this wasn t Austin I d give them 10 stars. But in Austin you can find a great taco in a tire store  seriously- we ve seen it . So yeah...  Check em out if you re already headed to the brewery anyway.
Con Todo,7,Great tacos and patio area  They have spicy sauces if you would like some ask for it  Taste is super unique best tacos  in ATX
Con Todo,8,Stopped by Cellis for lunch and grabbed some tacos. 2 tacos   tip came out to 12 bucks. Tacos showed up and were good  but nothing special  and kinda skimpy considering they are  5 a piece. Not really sure this place is worth it.
Con Todo,9,This was excellent  If you like some hot salsa get the red- loved it  The Avacado tostada was bomb  My man got the beef  amp  green sauce  amp  loved it  We will be back  Plus for the ladies ...  amp  some men... there is a beautiful man serving it up. Never hurts 
Con Todo,10,This food truck offers delicious tacos next to a cool beer garden. Beer with great tacos are perfect combination. The owner is nice and offers good service. I like how they have their sauces on the side. I find their orange sauce is too spicy for me  so glad it is on the side instead of putting on taco for me. Their tacos are tasty and quite unique compare with the tacos from many other places in Austin.
Con Todo,11,Chori-Papa tostada was sooo good. One of the best tacos I ve ever had. Vegetable taco and bistec also delicious.
Con Todo,12,Homemade tortillas  fresh ingredients  authentic recipes  fast and friendly service. There are not enough good things to say about Con Todo. Also  when they say the red sauce is hot  they mean it  and it is a beautiful thing.
Con Todo,13,One of my favorite taco places in Austin    Located at Celis Brewery  so I love to pair the tacos with a nice beer. I usually get the bistec but the daily specials are also bomb. The meat is always so flavorful  Only downside is that it can get pretty busy during peak hours and you may have to wait a bit longer for the food.   10 10 would recommend  
Con Todo,14,OMG SO GOOD  We got two tacos and a tostada and all were phenomenal. Def take a trip to this place 
Con Todo,15,This taco food truck was quite literally some of the best tacos I ve ever had in austin  possibly my life . The tortillas are perfectly crisp and the meat  beef  is so amazingly cooked. Adding a picture of the menu. But I m still shook by how good the food was - it s right behind Celis brewery be definitely worth trying all of them.
Con Todo,16,The welcome employee was super polite from the jump. Both gentlemen were attentive and patient with helping us decide what to order. My partner and I ordered  the Bistec  Campechano y Chori-Papa Tostada. I have to say  those thangs were delicious    Order it with everything. Green sauce or Red Sauce  straight fire   HandmadeTortillas
Con Todo,17, Best taco in Austin  is not an exaggeration. Been there 3 times and always walk away happy. Definitely in my top 5.
Con Todo,18,When I heard about Con Todo  I wanted to support my RGV community...but when I started seeing all the amazing food they were making on instagram   I was dying to go. I had the Bistec tacos estilo matamoros and they were THEE best tacos I ve had in Austin. They were even better than some of the tacos I ve had in the valley. This truck is going places and I can t wait to see how far they will go   I went during their first Frontera Fest and the vibes were amazing   The DJ was playing such fire music. This is everything Austin has been missing  
Con Todo,19,After a bad experience with the pizza guy infront of Celis I went around to the beer garden. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. Friendly service and really good food. These guys getall the stars
Con Todo,20,Incredible     Hope to get to travel back and enjoy again     Delicious food and amazing customer service     
Con Todo,21,I absolutely agree with this being the best tacos in Austin. There s a lot of good tacos  but this takes it to another level with complexity of taste. It s more expensive  but the taste is well worth it.
Con Todo,22,Delicious tacos    They were seriously so good  very crispy  lots of flavor  perfect spice level
Chipotle Mexican Grill,1,I would say the only downside of this location is that there s always a lot of people and some ingredient is missing --which I assume is because of its short proximity to campus. Today was the salsa    however  the food is consistently good 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,2,This location is absolutely awful. They don t take in line orders so u have to place a mobile order which takes forever and its always dirty and disgusting.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,3,This place is ass. Terrible customer service. The people who work here are slower than molasses. I placed my order to be ready at 7 and it s currently 8 05 and still have not received my food. AND they ran out of half the shit I put in my bowl that I already paid extra for. Chipotle get ur shit together. This is a highly populated area. West campus is full of hungry  tired  depressed students who shouldn t have to experience this additional stress.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,4,This is probably the worst chipotle in America. They are always out of something. They are very slow and the staff can t bring themselves to care.  Today  they were out of pico  ice  forks  and Diet Coke. Probably other things as well. Their location by campus is the only reason they do any business at all.  I love chipotle. Just not this one.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,5,I get that it s incredibly busy with college students most of the time  but for a major food chain that s no excuse to be constantly running out of ingredients. In addition  customer service was terrible and honestly kind of offensive  with one worker today that didn t even acknowledge me or look me in the eye while checking out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,6,Chipotle needs to get their act together. If you can t have an online order ready for an hour  your app needs to reflect that. This is the second time we ve had to totally change our plans because we have to wait for an hour plus longer than expected for an online order. Best part  We can t leave because we already paid. I love chipotle  but this location sucks.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,7,Heinously slow service.   The obvious problem is the people who work here sit on their phones all day. I have literally ever seen worse employees in my entire life  I ve gone 3 times and seen the same thing each time   Given how much people love Chipotle  as well as how many knowingly don t go to this store because of their service  it s essentially a joke on campus . Management could  realistically  2 - 3x profit by replacing their staff.  Honestly  if they don t  I will franchise a dos Toros or something nextdoor.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,8,Always out of ingredients and the workers are sooo slow. The management is terrible and the staff do not care either. I really hope that there is some turnover to fix this.   I came in around 7pm on a Saturday and they were out of chicken  lettuce  pico  corn  guac  and a few other items. I have even had similar problems at lunch hours  and this is far from the first time.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,9,This location is constantly out on ingredients. Online orders for pickup tend to also be delayed during busy times -- I ve waited 30 mins past the promised time to get my order. My friend found a bug in her lettuce once
Chipotle Mexican Grill,10,Great food  honestly the best chipotle I ve ever been to  seriously best burrito  The only thing bad I would say is that the tables were not clean at all and there was a cricket on one of the tables.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,11,I can t make this up  this is the amount of chips they gave us. I counted them...13 chips. Had to post cause it s kind of funny. But great burrito though.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,12,Pretty underwhelming relative to other Chipotle experiences...including when I used to come here as a student. Maybe it s because it s no longer school season but quality was off for this visit. Stations looked messy  I.e. the types of rice were spilling into each other   ingredients looked either too watered down or dry  and upon eating  something tasted off...it was a bit sour somewhere  I think the rice . Couldn t finish it  but again  maybe it was an off day since I ve had better experiences here before.  PROS  - timely service  - well-kept interior  - good portion size   CONS  - stations weren t too clean  ingredients spilling in to others  - some add-ins were evidently dry  beans  or too watered down  pico de gallo  - sour taste among something that probs shouldn t have been sour
Chipotle Mexican Grill,13,This Chipotle is in a great location. Good prices for a solidly healthy food option. However  at times they can be understaffed  particularly for special events like Boorito. Can result in extremely long wait times and sloppy service.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,14,Terrible service. There was no cheese and my steak was burned. Two thumbs down. -Henry Hagenbuch
Chipotle Mexican Grill,15,Mobile order takes 5x longer than waiting in line  which usually takes at least 30 minutes. Worst chipotle I have ever been to. Made my burrito with wrong ingredients.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,16,The one thing all my exes and situationships have in common with the Chipotle on The Drag is that I continue to give them the benefit of the doubt.   maybe he s changed... maybe he actually does care...  whatever.  I ordered a sofritas rice bowl w  guac  lettuce  pico  fajita veggies and corn for pickup. They gave me a bean rice bowl with sour cream  cheese   As someone who is lactose intolerant this was clearly a calculated attack against me  and guac. My mistake is that I should have checked before I got home.  Anyway much like the previously mentioned fools I ve wasted my time on  I would just like my time and money back. But I know that s not possible so I will settle for one of those unlimited burrito cards you give to celebrities.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,17,Pls don t work at chipotle if you hate your life so much that you consciously serve this to someone. To be fair I ordered 30 min before they closed but I was there to pick it up within 6 min and it s just never that serious  whoever made this bowl I hope you step on a Lego
Chipotle Mexican Grill,18,Every time I come here I want to die. I m so hungry and I get desperate even though I know I will walk out of this location wanting to dive into oncoming traffic. This pushed me over the edge yall. They gave me one slab of barbacoa FAT. No meat bro. I had to stab it and try to gnaw off a measly strip of meat that turned out to just be fat. This mighty immortal piece of flesh was just watching me eat the rest of my bowl for 20 mins.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,19,Don t bother stopping in. Wayne Svede and crew need some supplies and training.   No Chicken No Beef No Chicken Asado No Chips No Pico No Crunchy Tacos  Trying to ration what they do have.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,20,Do not eat there.  As of recently they claim their prices have gone up and I payed  18 for a chicken bowl and drink.  The woman said a scoop of guacamole is about  3.00 and this is why it added up.  You ve been warned.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,21,easily the worst chipotle to exist  the workers are rude and skimpy and don t offer any thing else if they don t have something.   for ex. they didn t have chicken  steak  veggies  black beans  and dried queso. no chips.   there was no  oh let us make some chips real quick   so terrible
Chipotle Mexican Grill,22,I hate this location. So slow  always out of everything  and staff doesn t care. Would give a 0 5 if I could. Horrible.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,23,I m walking out of here in a bad mood. Staff needs to take classes in operation management at McCombs. DO BETTER 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,24,Put order in at 11 45. Was suppose to be ready at 12. I walked out at 12 30 with no food and I couldn t even talk to someone.tried to call to get money back  chipotle just gave me run around with automated service and couldn t talk to anyone. Don t waste your time or money on chipotle  especially this one  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,25,This is the worst chipotle I have ever been to on the planet. Slow workers and are out of every food they have. Also gave me like 5 chips with my queso. Never go here
Chipotle Mexican Grill,26,So this place is burdened by a combination of personal incompetence of the staff and also terrible corporate policy.  I walked  physically  to the store to place an order but they had signs up saying they were  digital only  and refused to take an in-person order  it had to go through the website.   Fine  if I must  but this is dumb as hell.  The catch there is that the site doesn t differentiate between people ordering ahead and people physically in the store  so they prepared a large number of orders--all not mine.  Then--then   They started ignoring their signs and taking in-person orders.  They had the make all set up  I don t know why they wouldn t before  but they happily served over ten more people ahead of my order.  I complained to a manager and apparently they had also managed to lose my order in the shuffle--good thing I had the online receipt I guess.  To top it all off apparently red AND green salsa was too complicated to process.  So after twenty five plus minutes they couldn t get it right  and the carnitas was incredibly dry.  Staff offered no apology or compensation for any of this.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,27,It s 4 pm on a Saturday. They have to shut down the store because they have no food and 2 staff members. Terrible quality and management
Chipotle Mexican Grill,28,They messed up order. This has happened the past four times that I have ordered a quesadilla. The last four times I have ordered a quesadilla the sides have been wrong. To be frank I ordered the same meal every single time from the same restaurant. I order from this restaurant but it is always wrong. I always order a steak quesadilla with two sides of white rice and one side of the mild salsa or pico de Gallo. The past four times I have ordered from this restaurant through the app have been wrong. One time I received white rice and black beans  once I received no sides  the next I had one white rice and one side of pico de Gallo mild salsa. This last time I ordered two sides of white rice and one side of mild salsa or pico de Gallo with a steak quesadilla. I received two pico de gallos and an empty side. I am beyond frustrated and  confused.   I used to only order the quesadilla when I went to the restaurant. Now  I can t order the quesadilla unless it s through an app. When I order it through an app  my sides are wrong. I m not looking for a refund. I only want my order to be correct. My order is more likely incorrect than correct. This makes me frustrated and upset with the service from this branch of Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,29,Worst chipotle ever. Line to the door with one person getting food. At times she would disappear for several minutes. At least 4 other employees were in the restaurant. Not sure what they were doing. Waited for at least 30 minutes. All tables were dirty. All trash cans over flowing
Chipotle Mexican Grill,30,Holy crap. I cannot fathom how this location can possibly have more than 2 stars. Every single time without failure I wait 20-30 minutes for my food and they underserve me every time. And that s not even including the times when they are out of basically everything. Do NOT go here  It is not worth it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,31,Ordered my meal at 12 50 PM for pickup at 1 10 PM. Proceeded to wait 30 minutes past my pickup time until 1 45 PM to finally get my order. Oh  and I was late for class. Severely understaffed with four people at peak lunchtime. Best to avoid this location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,32,I typically love chipotle but this location just ain t it. Extremely slow and rude customer service. I asked for a cheese quesadilla and they looked at me like I was crazy and then said I have to order it online. That s never happened to me before but what was I expecting on a college campus.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,33,This location is always understaffed and running behind schedule for online order pick ups. This was the second time that this location was over 25 minutes behind.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,34,Stopped by for lunch with some friends and they were out of basic things a restaurant should have like forks.  Also  no guacamole which is kind of essential for a Chipotle.  Staff was rude as well which as I thought about it more makes the food not taste as good 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,35,There is not enough people working in the takeout line. I watched 3-4 full lines of people get their food ahead of me while I waited more than 20 minutes after the promised pickup time. I get it you are busy but people ordering online should have some sense of their order is getting fulfilled. I watched one person do the orders for all of the online. Don t say it s going to be a certain time and then have it be 20 minutes later and have there be cold and underserved. At if least the portions were good and food was served at a decent temp then it would be understandable. This place sucked 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,36,Look  the bowl I just picked up was actually amazing. However  just because I order online pickup doesn t mean my bowl shouldn t be filled as if I ordered in person. Despite the absolute amazing taste of the food  I was disappointed with how little food was in my bowl. Thanks for the great meal but please fill my bowl next time.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,37,Overall  a solid Chipotle location  They have messed up my order before but are pretty quick to make things right if you ask.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,38,Me and about 20 other people were waiting over an hour for our mobile orders Sunday night. Worst experience.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,39,It s Chipotle  it s always good. But this location is understaffed and there s often menu items missing and long lines.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,Good taste as usual with Chipotle  but the portion sizes at this location are noticeably smaller. The restaurant is quite dirty as well. The staff appear to have their hands full  so my guess is that the dirtiness is due to understaffing.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,41,Literally had to wait over an hour past when my online order said it would be ready. Employees were not helpful at all.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,42,They skimped on literally everything but cheese. There was no lettuce or pico. They gave me less than a scoop of rice. I prefer Free Birds  but I thought I d give Chipotle a try. What a mistake.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,43,Chipotle  the standard of burritos  I absolutely love Chipotle but this one definitely leaves something to be desired.  The location is great and convenient for students and gets pretty busy around lunch hours  12 PM is when the line gets pretty big . The service is quick and the tables are all very clean and well maintained.  My issue is the serving amount. The servers really only give half scoops. When you ask for double meat  its more of a regular at a different Chipotle.  I hope on my next visit I can get that full scoop of delicious steak.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,44,Always at this chipotle  Always consistently gives me large portions. Covid conscious and great employees.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,45,This chipotle is not good compared to other ones in Austin. Perhaps the one on 45th is better. Needless to say  I found a fly in my chipotle bowl MOMENTS before I almost ate it. Nastiest thing ever  and I haven t been back. I will never go to the one on campus ever again. The rice and chicken are always hard and dry. Not good. Repeat. Not. Good. Only three stars bc of how convenient it was.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,46,i wouldn t recommend coming here if you re trying to get your order fast. i don t know if they re understaffed or something  even though they re located on one of the busiest streets in Austin   but it took more an hour to get my food even though i placed my order online. staff seems so disorganized when trying to get people their food as well.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,47,A good cheap lunch option overall with decent portions and consistent food quality. It s not as good as Cabo Bobs but it s a decent fast casual option if you re on the southwestern side of campus. Definitely a place to walk to.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,48,I m obsessed with chipotle so what can I say  The food never disappoints. Sometimes the servers will skimp out on rice so don t hesitate to ask for a little more rice because they will always give you more if you ask. Sometimes it does depend on luck with how much food you get  but chipotle is one of my favorite fast food places to go and I never feel guilty about eating it because it is relatively healthy.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,49,Chipotle is great  It s conveniently located along the Drag in one of the busiest parts of West Campus  they have some fast service but they don t skip out during the busy meal rushes.   Located next to CVS Pharmacy  the Art Store and the Co-Op  Chipotle is one of those places if you want to get some quick mexican food in the form of a burrito  tacos  bowls  or salad form. This food is not only cheap in price  but it is also filling and healthy for you  depending on what you put in it  . I have read numerous articles online about what it says on  how to get the most value from a chipotle  or  how to not cheap out at chipotle   and those people are pure geniuses for the Chipotle cuisine world.  So  if you are interested in ordering something  here is what I get  -Ask for a bowl with tortillas on the side  make sure it s plural in tortilla and not just one  -Get brown rice  black beans  chicken and fajita vegetables  ask for extra vegetables  it is just that good  -Next  go get pico de gallo  corn salsa  cheese and lettuce to finish it off  I like extra lettuce for mines  -After you pay  go and squirt some Smoked Tabasco sauce  give it a shake  and it s good to go   Think of the tortilla as a spoon  or a scooper to pick up all the Chipotle goodness inside  it s pretty good  If you don t like the way I do it  then that s okay  There are plenty of combinations for you to try 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,50,Overall not my favorite chipotle  I enjoy the food however the portion seems smaller and the chicken isn t the best in my opinion. Service is pretty good and the lines are bearable considering it s on campus. Would definitely go again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,51,Chipotle has been there for me in my darkest and hungriest times so they deserve this four stars. Quick and convenient filling meals  what more can I say. The location has plenty of seating and is spacious. I d say it s good for groups. I usually go with the classic burrito bowl  you can definitely stretch out your money s worth by packing on everything.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,52,Probably the nastiest burrito from any Chipotle I ve ever been to. It was so bland and they were incredibly stingy on the portions. Nearly  8 for a small burrito with three unseasoned ingredients. Ugh.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,53,Justice is the BEST. Such a cool dude and super kind. Give this man a raise dangit 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,54,I usually avoid the chains in Austin since the local food scene is so good but got some food here by the campus due to convenience and time constraints. Pretty solid food as always.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,55,Mexican food is always a delight for me  This is the first Chipotle I tried out in Austin and it was as good as any other place. If you want a heavy  tasty meal under  10 this is the place to be 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,56,This place is a little overhyped tbh. It s good food  no doubt about it. But it s just not that good. Given the price and the amount of food you get  I don t think it s worth it. Maybe every once in a while  I would try it for the taste. But I can t see why there s a huge line every time during lunch hours.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,57,Went to order a bowl at 9 40pm tonight. Was told they were out of steak  cheese  lettuce  and corn. Are you freaking kidding me   Out of food or simply to lazy to go to the back and get additional food  You decide. Since half the bowl was missing you would of thought they would offer a free beverage  maybe guacamole  probably out lol    or something else right. Nope FULL PRICE   Eat here at your own risk.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,58,Service  4   Quality  4   Setting  3   Value  3  Must get  1 2 Chicken 1 2 Steak Burrito Bowl with Guac  In Austin  the land of tex-mex  there s still room for Chipotle. When you re really feeling lots of food and want it really quick  this is the place to go. They ll whip out your burrito bowl so fast  it s unnerving how fast your food moves down that line. You should probably spend your time in line thinking about what you want  because they ll make your order just as quick as you can spit it out. Since they are so busy  you may find scraps of someone s meal on the table you sat down at  but generally it s pretty clean. My only gripe... 2 FOR GUAC   Cmon. But again  all Chipotle s are pretty much the same so you know what you re in for.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,59,I am Chipotle s  1 fan. I probably come here at least every other day. Their value is incredible because you can always get as much rice and beans as you want with no additional charge. I always get the double chicken bowl with a tortilla on the side  4-6 scoops of white rice  and extra beans. Also  if you like working out  Chipotle is by far the best place for bulking. The service is usually very fast and efficient even when there are long lunch and dinner lines.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,60,I like how speedy this place is. There always a large number of students who pass through the area  so they re prompt with the order. And the staff are well trained. I did notice  however that they changed from romaine lettuce to iceberg lettuce  which is disappointing. But I don t know if that s a company thing or if it s this specific Chipotle. It s pretty average  and I honestly don t see anything too special about this Chipotle as compared to other ones. It s nice. There s not much to say about it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,61,Full of young students working  Every time I go they re nice and give good portions of meat   That s key. Any Chipotle that gives me good portions of meat is a Chipotle I will always go to. I usually get a steak salad  but I ve been opting for a steak quesadilla with diced onions. The meat here looks good all the time. When the Asian female manager  don t know her name  is working  THINGS GET DONE. The back is clean and things look organized. She is also a problem solver. The Powerade nozzle wasn t working  so she compensated by giving me a Nantucket juice. Also kept me updated with my extra crispy quesadilla. The other workers were nice as well. Smiles all around and they are quick  Worked like a team.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,62,Chipotle is always a really solid option for lunch or  dinner  The food is consistently tasty  I love that they are constantly adding new and fun meats veggie options to the menu. They also have really sweet promos and surprises in store or on the app  Regardless of what s going on  water boil  hurricane  pandemic  etc.   chipotle manages to make ordering easy  pleasant and fairly inexpensive  I love getting food from here 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,63,Below average. They don t give you as much food as other chipotles but the food quality is the same though. Still a college staple and conveniently located on the drag. Tried their new queso today and it wasn t anything special  actually  it was quite bland... kinda reminded me of the cheese they serve you in elementary school  and some of the chips were stale.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,64,Fast service  friendly people and a clean restaurant. What more can you ask for. It s a great place to stop in for a quick lunch on the Drag.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,65,I don t know why I keep coming back here. It s probably because it s really convenient but literally they barely give any food. I got less than half a spoon of guac even though it s  2.05    This is so disappointing since if I m going to be charged the full price I expect the full amount of food to be given.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,66,Terrible Chipotle.  Under cooked rice every time  stingy portions of meat... honestly on everything.   I only come here for convenience but after my last trip I won t be back.  Very disappointing as I ve spent so much money on chipotle over the years.  I think I ll switch to Cabo Bobs.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,67,Consistently good food. Some of the other locations ruin the experience with dry meat or bland rice. Never here whenever I go. The staff is so kind and accommodating. I love this store the most in Austin. Walk to it to pick up my order from the app. Always a great place and packed with students.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,68,I love chipotle so much  and their guacamole is really good. I really enjoy their taco bowls and they are only seven dollars which is very reasonably priced. The last time my food came 2 minutes late and they gave me a drink for free. I appreciate their customer service there and I would recommend anyone going to Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,69,Wish I could put zero stars. The customer service is horrible. All employees here have a bad attitude
Chipotle Mexican Grill,70,Oh  Chipotle  you are so cunning  locating right there on the Drag. I m not sure there is any other restaurant that I would be willing to frequent so  well  frequently. So  for that  I say thanks  About this location  it s just about the same as any other Chipotle. It s always hoppin   especially midweek during the regular UT terms. Nevertheless  those speedy workers are able to churn out burritos  burrito bowls  tacos  quesadillas  and  salads  like it s nobody s business.  Oh  speaking of  salads   here s a fun fact  even though they call them salads  these delicious meals are nothing more than an upside down burrito bowl with some extra lettuce and salad dressing. These things are awesome 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,71,I have been to several chipotle locations  this one was pretty average  very stingy on meat meat portions and the rice was undercooked so some of it was a little hard in the middle. other than that guac was fresh and everything else tasted average
Chipotle Mexican Grill,72,Everyone s all I could eat Chipotle every second of my life or like I used to like Chipotle but now they don t smile and give me less meat. So instead of getting in on the controversy  let me just give you some tips   -Free things  You can always get a big flour tortilla or up to three corn tortillas on the side  even if you order a bowl or a salad. Speaking of unnecessary carbs  you can also have your burrito wrapped in TWO tortillas.   -Those grilled vegetables for vegetarian entrees can also be added to meat entrees for free. Get those veggies in    -Also fresh chopped jalape os are hidden  but free.   -Even though they ask you if you want black or pinto beans and white or brown rice...you can actually have them all  I have found that if you say both  they actually give you more overall.   -You can also do this with meats  but they will charge you for the more expensive one.  So if I say  half chicken  half steak   I ll get charged for steak .  -If you re not food baby hungry  you can also get a quesadilla   2.95  or a single taco   2.25 .   -Guac  If you want it  order it on the SIDE. It costs the same and you get like double the serving.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,73,Oh Chipotle on the Drag what happened to you  You used to be the fastest place to get lunch near campus. You were so reliable and consistent. But things have changed and I don t like it. Maybe it was the introduction of the Sofrita that started the fall   The assembly line is painfully slow and coordination between servers and the kitchen is always out of whack. It seems like the chicken always runs out right as I try to order and will be  5 to 10 minutes  before more is ready. Maybe I should just go to Qdoba. At least they have free guacamole now.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,74,If it is 1 30 and you are starving looking for a place to grab lunch  skip all the other overpriced drag food and go to Chipotle. You will get a burrito that is borderline too much food for you to eat  though you will anyway.   The staff is overly friendly  like they took some type of zoolander brainwashing class together and now can only talk in positive notes  and they manage to give you just enough small talk to keep you interested but not enough to slow the line down. That s a tough combination to beat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,75,Oh my.  I remember the good ol  days.  The days when I could waltz in between classes with six people in line ahead of me and waltz right back out two light cycles later to cross Guadalupe to get back to campus.  Those days are gone.  Based on my observation  it s because of new staff.  I realize they have to spend a lot of time with these people every day  but they really don t have to be involved in full-blown conversations with them every time I m there  holding me up.  Last week I was there and one employee walked up and down the food line distracting each employee separately with conversation.  By the time I get to the register I have to tell the person what I ordered because the person supposedly keeping track of that is too busy chatting  today it was about how there are two people with the same name working there now.  I don t mean to complain  I really don t.  It s still convenient.  It s still good portions  albeit fairly inconsistent depending on who you get .  It s still a decent value.  But I only have so much time for lunch  please don t waste a chunk of it 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,76,Always good  customer service is always number 1 here I ve seen them remake people s food many times even just because they didn t like what they ordered. There is usually a long line  because it is Chipotle and it s on the drag  but they are usually pretty good about powering through the line and getting people their food quickly. Would definitely recommend.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,77,The chicken here Sucks  I had to destroy my burrito. I found myself taking the chicken out so that I could eat the veggies which were like whatever.   Pros   -Plenty of food. -sofritas are pretty good  Cons  -Expensive and whatever.  - shitty chicken - undercooked rice  Overall rating  Bleh
Chipotle Mexican Grill,78,When you go to Chipotle  you expect a relatively cheap  yet healthy and filling meal. I can say that this Chipotle definitely fills these requirements. Sometimes the line moves a little slowly  but I suppose that s what to expect from a place that has such good business. My biggest complaint is that the food portions have definitely gotten smaller since I first ate here over a year ago. If you need a big portion  follow these steps. Get a bowl not a burrito  tortilla on the side is free . Ask for double of everything  rice  beans  corn  lettuce... . Unfortunately  double meat costs extra. Not sure why they have gotten so stingy with their portion sizes but I suppose I ve adapted to the situation. If you want better quality and higher quantity of similar food  I suggest trying out Cabo Bob s.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,79,In the event that you are visiting from another planet  and if you are  stop reading Yelp reviews  for the love of gods  and go camp at Big Bend  or something  and have never visited a Chipotle  here is the concept  they serve assembly line  build-your-own tacos and burritos in tastefully minimalist midcentury modern spaces at highly reasonable prices. Everything is just north of average  they source their foods  e.g. quasi-organic chicken  better than any other national fast food chain  and they have vegetarian options  digging the sofritas  that are not a caesar salad or french fries.  Yes  Wendy s  I m talking to you.  This location does a standup job of processing truly enormous lunch crowds and keeping the place clean and stocked under the circumstances. Do they have off days  Sure. Can you get better tex-mex food at a quadrazillion places in Austin  Of course you can. But if you want familiarity and expediency while lunching on the notoriously hit-and-miss Drag  this is probably the chain you want to visit.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,80,Chipotle is generally a go-to option for me to get a carb-free  relatively tasty lunch. I go with a salad with extra fajitas  meat  pico  hot salsa and guac.   For whatever reason  this place takes forever to get your food  compare to other Chipotles . I used to go to one in New York that had twice the line and I would get my food in half the time. Not sure what they re doing back there.  Also - I ve had some inconsistency with the food here. Last time the pico was really soggy and didn t seem fresh.  I ll still keep coming here because they still have what I want but this is one of the weaker Chipotles I ve been to
Chipotle Mexican Grill,81,Typically a convenient place to grab a quick  cheap  amp  tasty meal between classes. Went last Sunday  amp  ended up with a bad case of food poisoning that is still lingering. I can t knock it for what it is and in my previous experiences I d chalk it up to 4 stars  but food poisoning once is food poisoning one too many times.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,82,Been here several times. The employees are always smiling and friendly and the food is consistently good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,83,The bar by which other convenient eating is judged.   Average in absolutely every regard.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,84,Fast service  2 out of 3 servers were smiling  the third one seemed to be glaring at me... burrito was okay but guacamole costs 2  extra   That s ridiculous. The tortilla chips were slightly stale and chewy. You could also see the salt crystals hanging off of it on one side  so they were very salty too. Overall  I would only go again if I m starving and want to get a large amount of food in a short time.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,85,This location really sucks. They give you very inconsistent amounts each time. From getting a full bowl my first time  then decreased to 2 3  and finally to HALF of what I got the first time  even though I asked for more and my friend who ordered before me got a FULL bowl. Don t come here if you don t want to get unfair amounts of food for what you pay for. Go somewhere else.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,86,A perfect convenient location for UT students  it s fast  cheap  and filling. Love their tortillas and I always order them on the side with a barbacoa bowl. If I m feeling rich I ll order some guacamole on top...because guacamole goes well with everything.   Although I never crave it  Chipotle has great food with quick customer service. The tables are usually clean and I can always find an open seat.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,87,Chipotle is just awesome. Its a great place to eat if you are flying solo  but if you sit at the high bar  please observe the unwritten rule that one stool should be vacant in between each patron. Nothing worse than someone sitting BEYOND close into your personal space and you can hear food breaking down in their mouths...  All in all  Chipotle has fresh food  it s really fast  love the brown rice and their lime chips are just amazing.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,88,I eat here a few times a week and I always get the steak bowl extra cheese and sour cream. I love coming here since its close to my job.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,89,Another typical univeristy Chipotle that is in a prime location for college students to get a quick and reasonably priced lunch.  Around the Noon hour the line is always long and the place is very small so there is very limited seating. I assume many students get it to go and eat outside on campus.  BIG PRO  You can order online from the website or the Chipotle app and they will have it ready 15 minutes after ordering.  You can skip the line completely and just pick up your food.  I typically get to-go but sometimes will sit and eat in the restaurant if there is a seat.    If you are coming from off-campus  parking will be difficult  but there is a garage at 24th and San Antonio that allows for guest parking.   I always get extra fajita veggies  brown rice and black beans and there is never an extra charge.  One of the reasons I really like Chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,90,Made by students for students. Brown rice felt like I was eating hard elongated pieces of sand.  Serving size is as if they were serving morbidly obese individuals who need to go on a diet.  Average for a Chipotle
Chipotle Mexican Grill,91,Tasty food. It s easy to customize and make it flavorful. Vegan friendly. Sofritas are nice. Wish they had more options for tortillas.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,92,As a college student  this was my go-to  I m out of groceries now and I m hungry but I don t wanna go to HEB right now but I want to be full  meal. And I mean really really full. Because they do it right here at this Chipotle.  Excellent service  long line that gets processed through pretty efficiently  fresh ingredients  chicken is excellent  pork is good  steak is good but sometimes too chewy  braised beef is great   friendly staff  what s not to like   BEST KEPT SECRET  Ask for  half and half  meat. As in   half chicken  half steak . Because no server is a huge stickler for portion size  you inevitably get more meat than you would if you just asked for a normal serving of one meat. Seriously  when I found out about half-and-half  it changed my life.   Also  be sure to ask for cilantro and or lime juice  which they have behind them on the counter but not in plain site. It adds a bit of extra kick to your meal.  God bless 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,93,I came to Austin during the 2018 October water issue and was extremely disappointed that this chipotle was not taking extra steps to insure my meal would have water to drink with it  Even the whataburger I went to the day before supplied free drinking water for there paying customers  Chipotle is just not what it use to be 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,94,We normally enjoy Chipotle but this location was not one we would return to.  The people behind the counter were a bit disorganized.  I don t know if it is the fault of the employees or the deafening sound system that was so loud it was hard to hear them and I m sure they struggle to hear customers let them know what they want.  The food was the same as other Chipotle s but I ve been to quieter rock concerts.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,95,Love chipotle  but this location SUCKS  its always something wrong with the food in this location  maybe because most of the customers are students and chipotle may think that is ok 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,96,I am writing this review about my discontent with Chipotle  in general  and only sort of about this specific location.  Though the line moves fast and the staff is friendly  I just don t like Chipotle. The rice is blah  there are not enough options  they don t even have queso for crying out loud    and it s just dull. There s no culture. It s truly the McDonald s of the burrito world  and that s putting McDonald s down  frankly.  If you need something quick and potentially healthy for a decent price  then it s fine  but do not expect for your taste buds to get excited. Go for a Freebird s or even a Qdoba before you do this. They may be more expensive  but your senses will thank you.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,97,Never....ever...eating here again. You guys gave me SEVERE food poisoning. I came in on Wednesday and got a steak burrito and a few hours later got extremely sick. I know it was from here because this was all I ate that day.  I ended up in the hospital hooked up to an IV after vomiting for ten hours and developing a fever. Last time I ever visit a chipotle. Just one look at this place makes me sick now.    Ugh. Worst meal choice ever.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,98,I m giving it 3 stars because it s a super convenient location and it s always very clean.   Aside from that  this Chipotle disappoints me.   They re running low on ingredients half the time so they skimp you on veggies and cheese ALL the time. The manager is rude and impatient with employees and customers alike. Pick up orders are never ready when you get there and they make you wait in line after people who just showed up to the store. Pick up orders also always have at least one mistake  like no guacamole on a veggie burrito  and sometimes they try to charge you extra for guac on the veggie burrito   Wtf   I never go here anymore as the Chipotle on N. Lamar never messes up this bad.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,99,Chipotle never fails me and if it does they always make it right  usually  I used my buy one get one free coupon and got to enjoy my yummy Chipotle burrito bowl    This location is always very fast and friendly. I love this place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,100,Chipotle is the restaurant that really started this whole fast casual craze when you think about it. The ordering process is hassle free and simple.  So where do I begin  I used to order the burrito religiously  until someone turned me onto the burrito bowl. It s just awesome and so much easier to eat. Chipotle is expensive if you order what you want. I will head this direction a few times a month  but I can t go more often than that because I would go broke.  I always get guacamole on my burrito bowl. Pico  sour cream  Guacamole  Cheese  Chicken all together. Hell yeah. Sure it costs ten bucks with a drink  but it s totally worth it. I like Chipotle more for it s consistency than anything else. Since they all make everything the same way  I know I ll get what I want.  Only negative  During the semester  there will absolutely be a line to the door at lunch hour.  About 20 to 25 people deep  It moves fast  but then finding a place to sit gets difficult. Walk across the street and there are tables outside of the Union. Enjoy 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,101,There are those of you out there who pooh-pooh chain restaurants calling them soulless and manufactured. While that may be true  I caution you to not pooh-pooh. Chain restaurants are a gluttonous staple amidst a culinary world of uncertainty  and a good burrito you can count on is something to appreciate. Never a gristly crunch or a chewy chunk of fat  wherever I am in the country I can rely on Chipotle for consistency.    Drag  Location  Although this locale is generally packed with patrons the line moves like a bowl of rice and beans. Henry Ford would be jealous of the assembly line s precision and deft as each customer is quickly moved along. Within moments you re at the register  presented with the hardest decision you may face all day  chips 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,102,My order of business when I frequent Chipotle    Bowl. Chicken. Onions Bell Peppers. Black Beans. RICE. Sour Cream. Pico. Corn Salsa. Cheese. Guacamole. Lettuce. Extra Tortillas. Tabasco. Lemons.   Not much else matters here.. and I ve got say that the rice is what really separates Chipotle from all the other burrito places in town.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,103,I am a huge fan of Chipotle burritos. I discovered a few years back when they put one in near my hometown. I soon discovered the joy of double meat  I don t like rice  and soon discovered the combination that works for me. Double steak  pinto beans  corn salsa  cheese  sour cream. Recently I have tried variations on this formula and have found huge success. The chicken is usually nice and juicy and I have discovered that their guacamole is great on chips. And oh the chips  The lime salt that they put on them has got to be the greatest thing ever.   Chipotle will always stand above Freebirds in my mind because the meat is so much more flavorful. At Freebirds I have to put the devil sauce on the steak burritos just to make it comparable to Chipotle s amazing steak.   Another great thing about Chipotle is what I can only describe as the post-chipotle poo. It always happens and it is always quite an experience. Chipotle is actually one of my home remedies for irregularity if you catch my drift.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,104,Because they have such a busy location  their food is always fresh. I wouldn t recommend any other location  ever.  Chicken is well marinated  steak actually has color  fajita vegetables are crispy  black beans are decent  and the tortillas are big and bland. Just like every other place on earth  they charge extra for their super shitty guacamole. Sadly  I m not really satisfied without it so I end up spending close to 9 bucks with a drink. Is it worth it  I go at least once a week.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,105,Even after eating Chipotle twice a week for lunch this summer  it remains my fast food Mexican restaurant of choice.   I get the burrito- double rice  corn salsa  lettuce  and cheese- and the chips with medium salsa. Oh  em. gee. Not only is the food delish  but the service at this particular location is great. Super duper fast. Don t be deterred by the line running out on to the sidewalk  It actually moves pretty quickly.   Also  as a vegetarian and moderate environmentalist  I support Chipotle s save the earth through burritos cause. Tasty  tasty  tasty.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,106,i like Chipotle  McDonald s owned chain and all  edit-no longer as of late 2008 early 2009  The meat they use is  free of hormones and antibiotics. At some locations in and around Charlotesville  VA  they use pork that comes from the Salatin Farms  see Omnivore s Dilemma . the carnitas  i ve heard  are pretty tasty.  i am no longer a vegetarian yet i usually order a veggie burrito because it  comes with guacamole. yum  plus i like beans. generally it lasts for more than one meal  but usually not more than 1 day because i keep thinking about it...The last time i went to Chipotle a few weeks ago  it didn t live up to my expectations  but it was in between the lunch-dinner rush  and i hope that had something to do with it.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,107,I ll keep this short  for once . Great location  fast and  usually  friendly service  and good food. In my opinion they re better then Qdoba and Freebirds  let the debates commence   I don t know how they make simple grilled chicken taste so good  but they do  even when I m sick of chicken at the time.   Word of advice  Get the burrito bowl w  the tortilla on the side if you want a bigger portion as they don t need to wrap the ingredients they re usually serve more. Also  either say it s to go or ask for the lid to the bowl  as you can put everything into the bowl  put the lid on  and then shake to combine everything.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,108,This is the Chipotle where a bunch of UT staff got sick a couple summers ago  but I ve eaten here a bunch and didn t have a problem.  UT sent out an email warning everyone not to eat there for a couple days  even  but it didn t have long term effects.  Anyway  I like this Chipotle.  Lots of seating  and it s surprisingly not that hard to find a spot on the drag around like  5pm  when I used to  meet fellow un-rich grad students before night class.   5.75 isn t too bad at all.  Back when I lived near campus  it was a great reason to go for a walk to grab dinner and walk back home to eat in front of the TV.   I order the veggie burrito.  It s huge.  Jen C. and I call it  eating a baby  because it s so big  it looks like an infant wrapped in tin foil.  You could cradle your dinner  guys.  The white rice is so delicious  it made me like white rice again- lime juice is their secret  I surmise by taste.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,109,It s like Freebird s...but it s not.    Only one tortilla options...plain ol  boring flour -- boo.  Deliciously different rice...lime and cilantro -- tangy   No refried bean option...only black and pinto beans -- eh.  More meat variety  chicken  pork  different beefs ...I ve only had the chicken but it was -- tasty   Lots of different salsa options...I like the pico-ish salsa and the corn salsa -- spicy   They also offer tacos  burrito bowls  burrito stuff w o the tortilla  and salads  burrito stuff with lettuce  I think .  A lot of people I have met are very polarized about Freebirds vs. Chipotle.  Love one  hate the other.  I think they are both pretty good  just different.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,110,When I go here I get a burrito bowl. I ask for a tortilla on the side  extra rice  half fajita and half black beans. The meat is totally up to you  but make sure that you add the SMOKED tabasco sauce.  I get a lid for the bowl  and I shake up the whole thing after I put in the tabasco.   After a well shaken burrito bowl  I pour half of it into the tortilla and make a small version of a burrito  because I like having more tortilla in ratio to the other stuff in the burrito. Then I finish off the bowl.  one of the best 6 buck meals if you are starving. It is also a good idea to save the half of the bowl and take it home for a late night snack. yummm soooo good.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,111,It s Chipotle  I mean really  who can complain about Chipotle  You put what you want in a bowl  tortilla or salad...if it s not good  it s probably your fault. Unless  your chicken has a bunch of chewy nasty fat on it...yeah  that happend. Everything else was absolutely great  I opted for the bowl with rice  chicken  black beans and other toppings...it was a great meal as Chipotle never disappoints except that I kept having to spit out pieces of fat from my chicken. Ew  I guess I should be happy to know that they use real chicken breast and not some processed chicken mystery meat mixture  LOL...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,112,I like Chipotle for a quick  no fuss meal. I am not a huge fan of burritos nor do I usually love chicken breast. This is the creation that I love from Chipotle  burrito bowl  no rice  with the yummy  marinated chicken breast  topped with the corn salsa  tons of cheese  a bit of lettuce and lots of guacamole. Instead of a fork  I eat it with their delicious chips. A GF introduced me to this style of eating at Chipotle and I have never varied from this recipe since. Yum.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,113,I absolutely love Chipotle. A fast food type restaurant that uses fresh real food and ingredients. Yes please   I have not had any issues with this location or my food. Since it is close to campus sometimes there are issues with the long line and finding a seat but no big deal.  I highly recommend ordering ahead of time online or with the iPhone app. It cuts down on the wait time in line.  Thank you Chipotle for offering fresh real food.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,114,As a student  I love this Chipotle  But when the boyfriend and I want to mix it up and go to another one  it just doesn t compare    Pros  Well if you ve ever had Chipotle  you already know its sooooo delicious  I literally go to sleep drooling over one and wake up hoping that someone s gonna want to go to Chipotle with me for lunch   The ingredients are very fresh. The service at this location is pretty fabulous and FAST since they get so much business.  Cons  Sometimes there s so many people that its hard to find a seat but usually it s not impossible 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,115,I go here prob once to twice a week and last few times I ve went my tortillas for my burritos have smelt like Plato they ve been cold you going to take a big bite of your burrito and it smells fucking gross like  .99 Plato from the dollar store and this is the first time it s happened like three times now it s a huge turn off for me because I go to chipotle because it s only thing the area and I like it when my food smells like The preschool room it just grosses me out.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,116,The service here is always fantastic  I love eating here. I can always get a friendly chat while designing my own burrito. There sometimes are some minor temperature issues  but always a quality meal.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,117,I LOVE CHIPOTLE    I could eat this 24 7  Okay maybe not  but I feel like I can  I never get sick of this place and yet I get the same thing every single time. Chicken burrito bowl  no beans  add the peppers.  Did you know you can ask for.. -A heated up tortilla along with your burrito bowl at no extra charge   -A pinch of cilantro on top of your bowl  if you love cilantro as much as I do   -Half brown half white rice  I also like this Chipotle since they don t skimp on the servings. If you want more rice or peppers or beans  they ll give it to you 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,118,I love this Chipotle  Especially when they have buy one get one free events.  Service is fast and food is always consistent.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,119,Food quality has gone down at this location. Steak is always undercooked  the portions are getting smaller. The worst thing though is the 40 year old lady working the line. She tries to be so quick and starts wrapping up your burrito while you are still talking. It happened today and she only gave me very little guacamole which felt bad. I hope she gets fired.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,120,Chipotle   Chipotle. Everything at this location is standard at all their other locations  they do give a little less at times  but i always ask for more to stuff up my burrito so its not really a problem. Love the convenient location next to campus  but lines can get pretty long... especially when they have buy one get one free coupons.   tl dr  standard chipotle nothing different from other branches  but still tastes mighty good  D
Chipotle Mexican Grill,121,The chipotle here is actually pretty mediocre compared the the chipotles i have gone to. This location gives small quantities of meat and protein like beans so don t be surprised when you get half a scoop. The meat is slightly drier in this location too. Today i went during an hour break i had between classes and the cashier was quite rude to me. She swiped my card and told me that it didn t go through and proceeded to swipe it another time. I gave her another card which i knew had money since it was a debit card and she swiped it and said it didn t go through with a really annoyed face. I got annoyed and told her that it did have money on it and she told me  well everyone elses card has been going through except yours  when she swiped my friends card and it didn t go through as well she finally contacted her manager. She told her manager  she made me keep swiping her card then she made me swipe another one  as if she wasn t the one swiping it. Well i looked on my paypal and realized i was charged twice and my other card was charged  once. And then the cashier didnt even apologize and the manager made me move to the side for 10 minutes so she could handle other customers ignoring the reject cards.  When they finally got to me they refunded me and left me with only 15 minutes to eat. You would think the cashier would have at least apologized for overcharging me or given me my meal for a free or even a free drink but nope. Just my time wasted here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,122,the WORST Chipotle in Austin  I love eating at Chipotle but if you have the option avoid the one on the Drag.  First of all the restaurant was a mess...it looked the Tasmanian devil had passed by and trashed the place. Second while ordering my food I didn t even have time to say  black beans please  when my bowl was already at the register.  As far as the meat  I got half a scoop of burnt chicken.   Once I finally sat down to eat my bowl I noticed my rice was swimming in a water-tomato liquid that was the pico. So in the end my bowl was the worst tasting Chipotle bowl I have ever had. How can you mess up a bowl  Go to the Chipotle on the drag and that s how  I get it they are super busy  but why should customers pay for their lack of planning   By the last few forkfuls I was approached by a homeless man with one shoe asking for money  can you spare a dollar for Godzilla . The homeless man proceeded to ask everyone else there before leaving the restaurant  including an actual employee who ignored him and continued cleaning tables. I will continue eating Chipotle because I love it but I will never step foot in the one on the Drag. I suggest u do the same.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,123,  1 Star for pledging to no longer use GMO ingredients  even though it s impossible to truly say that since their meats are most likely fed GMO feed...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,124,I hate that they think they can be skimpy just because we re students  and we ll keep coming back for the convenience of a Chipotle on the drag. I have to say  I appreciate how fast their lines are when it s extremely busy  but they ve been putting in less and less each year. Don t think we haven t noticed...  ASK FOR MORE. MORE. MORE    They can t refuse you.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,125,Eating at a place like Chipotle and complaining about gut bomb is ridiculous. Please stand up and remove brain from back pocket.  Chipotle is chipotle. Its not the best  but a good enough to keep me eating there about twice a month. Perfect for when UT students when they only have time for one meal  perfect  you can get enough calories for a whole day .   The best part of this particular Chipotle is the how fast they go. They usually have a cashier out running orders before you even order. Most of the ladies working  the line  remember me and I do not have to remind them of everything I want.  Really i think its overtly expensive for the food it is  but no biggy. Its not Freebirds  BBQ sauce please      but it ll do.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,126,Love this place  Always convenient when ordering ahead. And their staff is cute as hell especially that sassy cashier that was working today. Ijs
Chipotle Mexican Grill,127,If you really want a burrito  this shouldn t be the first place you go. Although I really don t like the limited options  the burrito isn t bad  but it isn t great either.  Also  their barbacoa seems to be confused as it is just shredded beef with some sauce  and not barbacoa de cabeza. It s cool though  I didn t expect much and didn t get much in return.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,128,Chipotle is great as always  had the barbacoa with black beans  amp  veggies  no rice  and the hot and corn salsas.  My wife loved her Chicken taco with mild salsa  though she found a few bits of jalapeno in hers  which she is not a fan of  for me  the hotter the better. Only drawback was the side of guacamole  great flavor  but what I thought was going to be a big  tender piece of avocado  was a tough chewy unripe piece of hopefully avocado with the rind.  Also some of the chips where soft  a bit moist  unsettling when eating chips.  I am sure an isolated incident.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,129,The food at Chipotle is ALWAYS delicious. But the portions here are dismal. I ordered a salad and got 5 piece of iceberg lettuce. I asked for peppers and got two slices of peppers on my veggie bowl. I don t know if it s a management issue or a problem of not having enough food ready  but the small portions here don t justify the price of an average meal. I d rather travel farther to get reasonable portions than come here for the sake of convenience. Sigh 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,130,Yeah  it s a chain restaurant and I usually try to avoid them.  However  the burrito bowl keeps bringing me back.  I think they put something in the salsa that makes me crave them.  I m getting hungry typing this review.  Pros  They move you through the line quickly  and give you excellent portions.  Not too much  not too little - just right.  My favorite is the chicken bowl with rice  black beans  green salsa  and lettuce.   I ve never had wilted lettuce or undercooked beans  meat  or rice.  it s always hot  fresh  and tasty.  Plus  they serve Nantucket Nectars  a bit of an up-charge on those  though .  Cons   During fall spring semesters  you have to time your visit just right during lunch  as it s quite popular and a line will form.  Best to get it to go in that situation.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,131,The place is super clean.. they are good at rolling a good fat burrito.. I am sure that I will be frequenting this place in coming years  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,132,Whether it s after passing or flunking my test  I most often find myself wandering to Chipotle. What can I say  I just flat out love Chipotle. I love that it s on the drag and ridiculously close to campus and that they serve great tasting food.   Can t go wrong with the steak burrito bowl. Something about their cilantro lime rice makes it super addicting. They also have a brown rice alternative too if you prefer it. The steak comes out in delicious cubed chunks and the corn is super tasty    I took a star off because sometimes they skimp out on portions but I just ask for extra rice in that case. You can also ask for a tortilla and they ll give you a piping hot one free of charge  I always end up only eating half of the bowl and then saving the other half for dinner or lunch the next day. Still tastes awesome.  Once in a while  they ll have their buy one get one free event and when that happens  there s usually a long line. Be prepared to wait. This certain Chipotle also takes bevo bucks so that s super convenient for UT students.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,133,Extremely poor customer service yet again. This is the third attempt to call in an order  because kids meals are not available online . They take your order then never have it ready. The point of call in orders is to have it done when the customer arrives. The lack of response in person  minimal apology and excuses only  to my frustration was not where I want to spend my money. Schlotzsky s got my business instead today and will continue to get that revenue. Not this Chipotle for sure.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,134,Service is horrible and the staff disorganized. Very little consistency on portions.  I had a bowl that was barely half full. The guy behind the counter was clearly overwhelmed. Skip this place if you can.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,135,Never had a problem with this location until two nights ago when I went with a friend. It was during the evening  two hours before closing  and the place was pretty busy because everyone is back for the school year. When we got there  the workers informed us that they were out of black beans  steak  and guacamole. What didn t make sense to me was that the staff had decided to start their closing duties a whole two hours early and decided not to continue remaking stocking their food items once it reached a particular time. The place was busy and people in front of me left because they were out of so much. It doesn t seem like a wise business strategy to practically push away paying customers because you wanted to get out early. I have worked in service for awhile now and that s not how you treat customers. I looked online and it still gave me the option to order all of the items they claimed they were out of. So I sincerely wonder if they were just saying that for the sake of not having to clean the kitchen later. Also  when telling the two people behind the counter what I wanted I felt so rushed because they were rushing me. So much so that when I asked the lady for salsa on the side  she had already smothered my whole bowl with salsa before I even finished my sentence. By this point the line had diminished and I was one of two other people ordering food. There was no need to push us out the door. We were never asked if our food was to go  which it was  and the cashier just stared at us after pushing our bowls to my friend and I until we had to ask him to package it to go. Overall negative experience. Would not recommend unless it s a craving.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,136,I like Chipotle. THIS Chipotle is terrible among Chipotles. Stingy with meat  lousy service  long lines  poor maintenance. The manager should be fired  rehired as a dishwasher   and then fired again.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,137,The food was fine  however the staff did not meet the usual chipotle standard. They were inattentive  and rude. Especially the girl handing the register  unfortunately I did not get her name. She gave me attitude during payment and I was even hesitant to go back and ask for a water cup  Very disappointed  hopefully they improve their customer service because it does not compare to other chipotles I ve been to. Everyone deserves a smile 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,138,Fast  convenient  and affordable tex-mex. Chipotle s burritos and burrito bowls are above average for fast food restaurants. This is because Chipotle uses naturally grown meat  or so the business claims  and very fresh ingredients. The meat is well-seasoned  the veggies are very juicy  and the rice is super aromatic. Chipotle is also very big and spacious  and during lunch time  quite a bit of UT students crowd the restaurant  making the lines long and the eating environment loud  but I still enjoy coming to Chipotle. Not only is the food healthy and delicious  but did you know that the business is also very charitable and will give away a free burrito if you dress like one on Halloween 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,139,Even with the line out the door  noonish this place get crazy busy   I made it out the door with a burrito in less than 10mins. They could charge double and it would not slow down my consumption rate. I believe they call this an inelastic good in economics 101.   FYI ask for an extra tortilla on the side  no charge  and then get double everything... eat half the burrito and wrap the 2nd half with extra tortilla for round 2.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,140,They re fast and friendly.  Great location on The Drag.  Order ahead to avoid the long lines during peak hours 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,141,For about a month i had Chipotle about fifteen times. I would look forward to the amazing hard tacos or a delicious burrito... then i read the calories and i have not been back since. I can no longer rely on it as a  healthy  option.  even though the food is fresh and wonderful . So if you LOVE getting Chipotle without feeling guilty about it  just don t read the nutritional information.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,142,This location is ok  but compared to other others it is stingy on ingredients  especially meat.  I feel like if the staff was more attentive in listening customers the service would improve. Overall good but not great  customer service and stinginess need to improve 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,143,dude. 4 stars for location and amount of food that will give ANYONE that freshmen 15 no matter what grade age profession you are.  they have large burritos man. i mean you can compare it to freebird s but they just differ too much.   yeah no variety with the tortilla  but can ANYONE actually taste the flavor in the tortilla   barbacoa is the way to go. Succulent meat in your mouth 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,144,Oh Chipotle  what would my life look like without you  I check into this location so many times  I ve been the mayor for 6 months now  and proud of it  This location is usually consistent  fast and very friendly.  They seem to run out of things  cheese  steak  peppers  etc  faster than the other locations but I ve never waited more than 2-4 minutes for it.  Highly recommend ordering on your iphone web ipad so you can walk past all the scrawny 18 year olds and show them how cool you are. Haha. Sounds kind of sad now that I ve written it. Hmm...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,145,guilty  corporate pleasure. i can t believe i eat here in the land of authentic  locally owned burrito shops   i get a no-diary black bean   guac burrito. service is great  super fast and friendly. wish it cost like 1.00 less or came with chips. but it is  indeed  the size of your head.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,146,Love these burritos. I always get vegetarian so I won t have to pay extra for the guac. I was sad when they raised the prices by 50 cents. However  the burrito is still a pretty decent size for  6. Gets crazy busy during lunch. Also  I m not a fan of the beans. They re spicy  and hard. I heard the burritos have more calories than a Big Mac. Oh well  as long as you don t eat one of these every day I think you ll be OK. Now what they need to do is stay open 24 7 like Kerbey Lane.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,147,Chipotle  please post something on your door to inform me next time you run out of an ingredient. ie. CHEESE.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,148,Since Freebirds is the greatest burrito place ever  and argueably the greatest fast food joint ever  I would love to give this a 1 just to hurt the competition. However  to be fair  Chipotle has a few redeeming qualities. One thing  sour cream is free there  which is nice. Also  if you consider it  its cheaper than freebird s also. They do have the smoked tabasco sauce  which is great if you eat in. But they get pwned on the sauces  what do you mean  no Bar BQ    cheese  uh... MIXED PLEASE    and beans  Pinto is a no-go . I don t try the burrito bowls  because that would entirely defeat the purpose of eating at a burrito place  so I have no opinion. But seriously  yall go to Freebirds. I m telling you.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,149,Chipotle is the number 1 option for UT Austin students who wish to eat healthy on the cheap. Wait times are extremely fast and staff members are courteous of each customer s individual specifications. Lettuce  lemons  and beans are the freshest I ve ever seen at a restaurant. Expect to pay about  7 per burrito or bowl  but bills can run to to  13 with pricey extras  guac  chips  drink . Definitely worth going to every once in a while.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,150,Ok  I really give this place 3.5 stars but it wont let me. I ate here alot when taking summer school at UT. The first time I ate here  I was like sweet  it tastes sooo good. by the last time I ate here  I was like  aww man  I feel sick. I sort of got tired of it. The chicken is a little over cooked making it a little unhealthy. Also they don t give ENOUGH meat in their burritos    But what ever happens  I still love chipotle  it s kind of like a really long relationship between two people that sort of dies off and your ready for someone else..... But I recommend this location. the staff are nice and i had many good memories with dorm friends when I first started attending UT.   Another plus for fellow UT students  they take bevo bucks  so if you had extra for on campus living or your parents just like to annoy you by putting money on your ID  just run down to chipotle 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,151,The thing I don t like about Chipotle is the cattle-drive format. You stand in line like a herd of steer and when you finally get to the team of cowboys that take your order they pull out there cattle prods and torture you to get you to order quickly.  Soooo much pressure.. I leave work to enjoy a relaxing lunch and I get the  look  from the  8 per hour employee that I am sooooooo stupid because I didn t decide when I got out of bed in the morning that I wanted pork  lettuce  taco  etc.  If you hestiate for one second you suffer the scorn of the employees and risk being stampeded.. Food-wise  I only like the Chipotle Tabasco drenched over anything. God help you if you get the burritto.. It is as big as a small child  full of rice.  Not my favorite place.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,152,I ve never been a huge fan of tex-mex  but after moving to austin I have fallen in love with everything and anything that is wrapped in a tortilla. Now chipotle is not the epitome of the burrito  but when i need to satisfy a craving for some fajita chicken  i look to chipotle. It s close and very filling. Everyone says that they put too much rice but i love rice so it s great for me. It s a little pricey but for the amount of food i guess i can let it pass.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,153,I discovered this little gem near campus about 6 months ago and I have been going back ever since. If you are ever near campus and find yourself craving authentic tex-mex this is the place. They use cage free beefs and chickens in their food which is much better than in the cage. The burritos can be big but if you can eat the whole thing its worth it. The only reason I didn t give this restaurant five stars is because I never award five stars...NEVER.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,154,This place used to be great.  It s hard to find decent food close to a college campus  and one could depend on Chipotle to take a little care.  That seems to have ended a couple months ago.  I usually get chicken and one thing I hate about getting chicken in a restaurant is biting down into a huge chunk of cartilage.  One of the things I loved about Chipotle  is that this never happens.  Until two months ago.  I bit down on my burrito and felt the sickening squeak of inedible chicken part on my teeth.  I pulled it out and then bit down again... on another huge piece.  I m a forgiving sort  but this nauseated me to the point that it took me over two months before I could stand the thought of eating there again. But last Monday  Feb. 17  2014  I went back.  And by golly  there was that nauseating squeak again.   This should be a no brainer   Cartilage is not  filler .  There are absolutely zero people in the entire world who would prefer  more volume by means of cartilage  to  less volume of real chicken meat.   If you have to scrimp for a few pennies by tossing in some pre-pink slime  then who knows what else you re scrimping on     I m ruined on Chipotle.  Not because I m stubborn but because I can t get past the nauseating memories.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,155,One of my favorite burrito chains  This one was clean and had friendly staff. And it s location is convenient right next to campus.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,156,Awesome location right on the drag. Burritos are off the hook especially the steak . I could eat Chipotle everyday.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,157,This is the best location of Chipotle I ve ever had the pleasure of eating at.  The management is great  the burrito makers are fast and accurate  and the ingredients are always FRESH  FRESH  FRESH.  That s probably because it doesn t matter what time of day it is  there is always a line... which often goes all the way out the door    However  the line moves fast  and the burrito that is waiting for you at the end is worth the wait...
Chipotle Mexican Grill,158,I would eat here everyday if I could.love it  sometimes this location skimps on the portions but very friendly staff. The manager is great    One thing that I don t like is the homeless people coming in and taking free soda from the machine.none of the employees seem to notice and if they do never say anything
Chipotle Mexican Grill,159,Fast  cheap  reliable  what more could you ask for   I came in here with a few coworkers yesterday for lunch and everyone was happy with their meals.  Chipotle is a good choice for meat eaters  vegetarians  and vegans alike.  This particular Chipotle is nothing out of the ordinary...clean restaurant  fresh ingredients  huge burritos.  Even at a very busy time of day we were able to get in  eat lunch and hang out with no problems.  Good lunch option if you re on the Drag.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,160,This place is good  fast  and friendly. Go during the early hours that its open  older people with better service.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,161,Wow.  Holy crap.  This place is not bad  considering it was once owned by McDonald s.  The service is insanely fast  not even Junior at the Wendy s in the Texas Union can keep up with their pace.   Everything is fresh and there are very reasonably healthy options here.   The additional option of a burrito in a bowl is very nice.  Now  if only I could get a latte here.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,162,I love this chipotle  Everyone s who is anyone has experienced chipotle but it s always great when everything is super fresh and hot  and since this chipotle is at a pretty busy intersection everything is always fresh and hot and of course super tasty 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,163,They gave me less in my burrito here than anywhere else  despite me asking for  extra lettuce    extra rice   and  extra salsa . Still  it was delicious and convenient  and has a cool atmosphere. Yum.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,164,This place is the guilty pleasure that I never  never  never want my Mexican family to know about. I always get a nice big burrito with beans and meat and cheese and rice and feast on it. There have actually been days where I have just gotten one of these and grazed on it throughout the day  making it my late breakfast  lunch  and dinner. They re just so massive that I can t imagine eating a whole one in one sitting. The most I ve ever gotten was three fourths and I was disgustingly full of food and regret for a long time afterwards.  I recommend going here if you re very  very hungry. But don t tell anyone else what you re doing. They ll just think less of you  even if they sneak over there themselves .
Chipotle Mexican Grill,165,Compared to other chipotles  their sizes are tiny. Its almost like they are downsizing their burritos because of the recession. One of the servers was particularly hostile to me  making eye contact and glaring at me. Id recommend staying away from this place unless you are looking for a cheap lunch or have to have chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,166,Burrito bowls offer a great alternative to burritos.  Their cilantro rice is perfect.  Guacamole is fresh.  Proteins are lean.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,167,it s chipotle. it s what you d expect from chipotle.   if you get a burrito bowl and want tortilla on the side  get the 3 taco tortillas instead of the burrito one unless you like ripping up tortilla pieces and trying to awkwardly wrap food in them and hoping the food stays in on its way to your mouth.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,168,this place is always packed during lunch hours  only on weekdays though. But I always find myself willing to stay on the long line during these hours to get some good and affordable lunch. It might be a little heavy on the calories  but i just don t really care.  I usually get the fajita burrito with carnitas  pork   hot red salsa  corn  sour cream and lettuce. at times when i am not so stingy with my wallet i add a heaping scoop of guacamole into it.  i agree with the chipotle-loving group that i find on facebook   Usually when someone roll me something this good  its illegal. 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,169,Best veggie tacos.  Yes  I said it Taco Deli   Lots of locations in town.  Drawbacks  music is too loud  and part of the McDonald s food empire.  But don t hold that against them  worth trying.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,170,Not great on the waistline  but I LOVE their commitment to  Food with Integrity  
Chipotle Mexican Grill,171,I have no problem with the Chipotle chain of restaurants.  In fact  Chipotle is probably my favorite fast food chain.  However  this particular establishment does not live up to the standards of the other Chipotles at which I have eaten.  My biggest problem is that this Chipotle in particular uses less ingredients than all the others I have been to  especially when it comes to the meat.  I always have to ask for more  whereas at the other stores I receive plenty.  The location is convenient for college students like myself  and the quality of the food is comparable to other Chipotles  but I do not appreciate how they always skimp on the ingredients.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,172,Holy Crap this place needs an adult  Chipotle is one of those restaurants that really has no excuse for being completely unprepared for business  but this one is an absolute mess ALL THE TIME  I arrived at 8pm to a line about halfway to the door  not insignificant but I ve seen other locations bang that out in 10 minutes. Not this one. During the 27 minutes I was in line there was a wait for chicken twice  a wait for steak twice  sometimes there were four people working the line  sometimes one. The cashier was restocking bottles  incorrectly no FIFO  while people were waiting to pay  There were at least 8 people working at the time they all look like teenagers and no one seemed in charge. To make it not just annoying but insulting the actually had the balls to take time to yuck it up with each other  As if this whole being at work thing was just way to kill some time between bong rips. The burrito I had was fine  they were out of taco shells . Will you please hire a manager.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,173,I love Chipotle.  It s fresh.  I get to customize it the way I want it right in front of me.  I get a lot of food for a very reasonable price.  I always get a burrito bowl and squeeze lots of lime on it.  And it s all gluten-free except flour tortillas 
Chipotle Mexican Grill,174,I wouln t recommend this place to eat burrito  they don t really know what flavor is all about. definitely I go for Changos burrtios  they have the perfect ones.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,175,I like Chipotle but NOT this location. I went here back in 2004 and the servers need I remind you they were Mexican and didn t speak English good of course  were so rude to me. I was nice and smiled to them and they were just so curt and nasty. Well when I went to check out I asked for the manager and I told him how they were and they had the nerve to stand there staring in my face mocking me and laughing. The manager of course was REALLY nice and even gave me a card for a free burrito or bowl. Needless to say I have NEVER gone back to this awful place. Oh and like another poster said they are stingy with their rice. I mean they charge you 10-11 bucks for a bowl and only want to give you little rice. Then when you ask for more they look at you dumb founded and annoyed. It s like hey I can take my business and money else where Paco if you want to have your little attitude. Y all need US and without the customer you wouldn t be in business so just remember that. And it s probably a SMART thing to want to please the customer so they will come back and keep giving you business and will probably right good reviews about your establishment.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,176,Like any other Chipotle  everything tastes pretty standard.  It is a chain so that s expected.  And like every other Chipotle  whenever you order food  to the people working behind the counter never  ever listen to what you want to eat.  But they usually get at least 80  of your order right haha.  Maybe it s because of the noise or the madness of lunch rush  but this always happens.  I don t mind getting spicy sauce instead of mild because they couldn t hear me once in a while.  It can get really rowdy and loud in there when everyone and their mom decides that they want Chipotle.  I guess that s what you get for eating on the drag  especially during rushes.  Anyways  it s definitely a keeper and a good place to go for consistently good food.  It can get really rowdy and loud in there when everyone and their mom decides that they want Chipotle.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,177,A good restaurant for a quick burrito. Be aware  the burritos are huge. I prefer the burrito bowls because they re easier to eat. Sometimes the meat isn t as cooked as I would like it though.
Chipotle Mexican Grill,178,Burritos the size of footballs. Fresh- they make it in front of you. Parking can be a challenge  but worth it if you re hungry.
El Chilito,1,I ordered 3 tacos  1 burrito  and 4 salsas  which aren t free btw  I got ZERO salsa which kinda ruins the vibe you know     Besides that horrible disappointment the tacos were freaking amazing  That puffy taco...ooh baby    The burrito I saved for dinner. My air fryer took it back to its original goodness   Could ve used some salsa... 
El Chilito,2,I want to be transparent  my companion ordered food from here after a night of debauchery  so this review is based upon the  morning after  taste buds.   We ordered an amalgamation of things to include a variety of tacos  chips  salsa  black beans  etc. However  I specifically ordered  for me only  the carne asada taco and chips and salsa.   Carne Asada taco I added fresh jalape os to give my entree a little AM pick me up. Unfortunately  the jalape os could not save the dried-out meat nor could the slathering of charred tomato salsa a top the taco. Perhaps this was an  off-day  for this spot or maybe it was just me  However  dried-out meat is something I can t look past.
El Chilito,3,There is plenty of parking  and restaurant was clean  and these things matter  but the quality of the food also matters.  The tortillas were so dry and crumbly on my taco  that they fell apart  there was not much filling inside of the taco  so I definitely do not recommend the tacos here.  I guess I can say I do recommend the Horachata  its delicious     I am concerned  that the staff did not get the cashier or let the cashier know when we wanted to order more food. Did not acknowledge us and just walked past us multiple times. While we stood and waited up to five minutes  until the cashier came back.  So  there is a red flag  and I do not think this is something that happens all the time at this restaurant. However we ordered chips and queso  and took some of it home. There was an actual staple embedded inside of one of the chips  luckily we saw it so we did not eat it and swallow something metallic like this.  But this goes to show quality of care in the food is not good. Will not return soon.
El Chilito,4,I don t remember signing up for emails  but somehow I got a marketing email from el chilito that they have  5 burritos on Wednesdays  so I went. I got the La tinga  spicy chicken  burrito. It was decent but not the best tinga I ve ever had. It had the chicken  rice  beans  and lettuce. I also got churros for dessert and those were pretty good.  I probably wouldn t get tinga de pollo again but would definitely try something else.
El Chilito,5,This establishment is better than their one closer to downtown.  Let s reviewwww shall we  Pros-  great outdoor seating  they have nice party looking lights that come on as the sun goes down.   The food   I always get the puffy taco and it s ALWAYS Delicious.    Cons-  they can t help it but with outdoor seating comes pesky bugs right    They do have a small indoor seating area as well
El Chilito,6,Still solid breakfast tacos. Friendly service and a nice vibe. It s just hard to give a fifth star in this town with so many other great places around.
El Chilito,7,Saturday morning vice...  I really like their salsa charra.  I usually build my own taco  or sometimes stop in just for chips and salsa.
El Chilito,8,Excellent meat quality and flavors. The burritos are some of the best I ve had in Austin. Breakfast and normal varieties of tacos are also very good.
El Chilito,9,Average breakfast tacos and burritos. The flavor of everything was pretty bland  and the queso was overly thick.
El Chilito,10,They have great tacos with lots of vegetarian options and a couple of tasty vegan options including the Brentwood. If you re really hungry  the taco fixings can be made into a burrito that s very filling. Also  check out their soups. There s a different one each month.
El Chilito,11,Fantastic place. The ladies at the counter are just lovely folks. The food is scrumptious and not at all expensive. The patio area is really nice and cool. Would highly recommend coming to this place.
El Chilito,12,After my wiping a tiny square of a table  so I wouldnt stick to the table  and getting a black filthy cloth  I showed it to her. About an hour later each table got a 2 second swipe. I can imagine the Health Dept might have something to say.
El Chilito,13,Javen was taking my order and was so kind and funny. great customer service and really good food. 100  recommend this place
El Chilito,14,I really love this places breakfast tacos loaded and flavorful. Everytime I order though they forget my salsa and straw everytime even when it s put in special instructions
El Chilito,15,I live right around the corner from this spot  which has proven to be very dangerous. Not only are their tacos and menu items consistently delicious  their staff is equally as amazing. I typically am greeted and helped by Chris K. He s warm  inviting  and overall has made me want to continue coming back to this rad taco joint. Thank you to all the staff at El Chilito for creating a gem I get to frequent and live around the corner from
El Chilito,16,El chilito is our neighborhood go-to. The food is great for the price and quantity. They have a good selection of vegetarian options. Their puffy tacos are AMAZING  especially when dipped in queso  and they have a nice open yard for those who want to eat outside. If you re looking for a quick  not-so-healthful lunch  el chilito is the place to be.
El Chilito,17,They re always nice and the tacos are good. They re proxy for some but they use quality ingredients and they always taste delicious. I m a fan of the Cochinita Pibil and the Chicken Tinga. I would take a picture but I devoured them sorry.
El Chilito,18,What are y all people talking about  tacos    Just want to make sure I am not confused because this is not TexMex authentic at all. If you grew up in South Texas skip this place. Don t get steered the wrong direction like I did. I can handle middle of the road Austin breakfast tacos  but these were awful. They have quality ingredients  but they just slap everything together and turn it into slop in a tortilla. There is a process to making tasty and quality breakfast tacos. It matters how each element is prepared before coming together in the tortilla. It s not Cordon Bleu  but you have to care about what your doing and it s clear El Chilito does not. So  kick yourself in the ass and make them yourself...it s not rocket science and you won t be disappointed.
El Chilito,19,only one person out of 5 working was wearing a mask  it s stage 5 y all . and about half the other customers wore masks.  the food was okay - portions were decent  everything in the breakfast tacos seemed fresh  but the puffy tacos were disappointing  and the  crispy potatoes  were spongy. the sand a agua fresca was good though. prices seem regular but i was just not satisfied for how much was spent.
El Chilito,20,I want to preface this review with the fact that I do not normally leave reviews for businesses as I believe their service and product should be able to speak for itself  and not be affected by consumers subjective  uninformed opinions.  With that being said  El Chilito on Manchaca is one of the best taco joints in Austin. I stop by daily because I suck at making myself breakfast in the mornings and they are on my route to work. Not only do they have my order ready on time early every day  but they ve also never missed an item. The staff are all very friendly and the open faced kitchen  and dining area are always kept very clean.  The cooks definitely know what they re doing and the food is always on point. I don t know what the staff are getting paid  but it s definitely nowhere near what they deserve for their work ethic and friendly service. Always be sure to tip your local taco guys.   P.S. the cold brew is real nice.  P.P.S. There are a couple murals on the building painted by a local Austin legend  El Federico  be sure to check out more of his work on IG.
El Chilito,21,It was okay. I thought it was going to be more authentic but it was more gringo style.
El Chilito,22,Delicious tacos with a family friendly price point and plenty of options for everyone. Queso is particularly delicious and the rice and beans are great options too.
El Chilito,23,Great place to go for a bite to eat. Prices are reasonable and good selection of choices for all. Service is great. Very friendly and did not have to wait long for the order. Been to this location many times and never been disappoint.
El Chilito,24,Good spot for breakfast brunch  because they serve it all day  albeit pricey compared to many other tacos spots in S. Austin.   I normally get the Cherrywood burrito  7.50 sub chorizo for bacon. Today was the second time in a row they ve not fulfilled my request to actually SUBSTITUTE chorizo for bacon. This would normally be a happy mistake for most  but I unapologetically don t care for bacon lately. It s annoying to pay more for something you specifically didn t order. The solution to this problem would be to dine in for quick correction of mistakes  OR for staff to utilize the software ordering system correctly.  Overall  good food fairly fast  my order was ready for pickup within 10 minutes   good customer service  but premium priced food.
El Chilito,25,I ordered a miga taco on corn with no cheese. I got home  which is about 15 minutes away and my miga taco was on flour with cheese. However after scraping off the cheese and putting it on my own corn tortilla taco  the tacos was wonderful. Great flavor and the salsa is very good too. Just a heads up  check your food before you leave the parking lot 
El Chilito,26,I give 2 stars because I haven t tried the food yet.  Door says they open at 7am but on my first visit they still weren t open at 7 10 on a Friday morning.  People who have to get to work can t wait around hoping a business will open.  Twice while I stood outside someone behind the counter looked me in the eye   Not a good first impression  -   UPDATE 10 25 18   stopped by for breakfast again this morning around 7 30 and that were open and in full swing.  I ordered two tacos  the Gringo  bacon  egg  and cheese  and the Vaquero  Carne asada  egg  and cheese .  Served with a hot sauce that was delicious  thick  and spicy.  The tacos  both served on flour tortillas  were both delicious  but the Vaquero was the bomb   Ohhhh soooo goood   Service was easy and quick.    Raising my review from 2 stars to 4 
El Chilito,27,I am munching down on a Migas taco as I write this review. Plenty of egg tomato and chopped up corn tortillas to make this a tasty little bite and I m looking forward to having a lunch or dinner there as well. Since it s supposed to be a food review website I can tell you for fact that the two breakfast tacos that I ve had today are outstanding. I look forward to exploring this little place and the location is perfect and the interior and exterior are clean and fresh. No 5th star because they only have one kind of hot sauce.... and its not hot.
El Chilito,28,This place inside is so cute and I had great service.  Mogadishu was delicious  just wish they had more sauces.
El Chilito,29,We took a chance and tried this place today. We ordered two carne asada tacos  a picadillo Taco  a puffy taco  and a San Antonio Taco  churros  and two ojo rojos. Total was around  55  and we were excited to get our food delivered. This whole order was just a huge disappointment as everything was dry and flavorless  the refried beans taste really strongly of jalape os and nothing else  there was pretty much no sugar or cinnamon on all the churros  and the drinks were awful. Tasted like their horchata that they re supposed to mix the espresso in was just straight up water. All in all  pretty upset I spent money on this. Taco Bell would have tasted better-that s saying something.
El Chilito,30,The atmosphere is wonderful and the food tasted great. But my small salad   chicken was severely overpriced.  My boyfriend ordered 2 tacos and they were SO small. The tacos were on the same pricing scale as Torchy s so we expected a full nice sized taco  like Torchy s . When he got them  they were so sad    Decent food  not worth the price...but great decor and atmosphere.
El Chilito,31,First and last visit to this place. Paid  17 for a salad and a soda. SEVENTEEN DOLLARS      Large Spinach Salad   9  add chicken   4  and a drink   3 . Asked what the difference was between a large and a small   7  and was shown two of what appeared to be the exact same containers. The guy then says  one is deeper . Oh  I see  so there s room for more spinach   Too short on time to leave to pick up a salad from Central Market.  I get my order less than 2 minutes later and I open the top to see 3 oz of grilled chicken thigh  3 sad slivers of avocado  0.5 oz  and loads of spinach. Less than 2 tablespoons of the rest of the ingredients. Yes  I can eyeball food measurements. I m that good.  I m sorry but for a  14 salad  I would expect more substance. Chilito is clearly attempting to appeal to the hipsters and the dinks in the neighborhood which is unfortunate. With a huge collection of medical employees nearby always looking for something to grab at lunch  this nurse and all her co-workers have crossed Chilito off our list of places to go. The empty salad container with a   14 at Chilito     is sitting in our break room so the doctors and nurses can all learn from my mistake.
El Chilito,32,We ordered food for 10 and it was delicious. Veggie and ground beef tacos  queso. Veggies were spicy and delicious. The rice was fantastic too. Do it 
El Chilito,33,The horchatas are really good but the tacos are subpar. They are overstuffed  unseasoned  meaty  double wrapped tacos. I ll go to the Fiesta Supermarket and order my tacos there before I go here again. Also if you order a side of anything it come in a tiny container. You re better off bringing your own  side . For instance  a side of avocado is just two thin slices for an extra  0.75. You can get a medium size avocado for that price. Lastly  Don t get bamboozled by the Virgen de Guadalupe painted on the side of the building. The only thing remotely Latino about this place are the cooks.
El Chilito,34,Yummy puffy tacos  mine were beef picadillo. I ve also had their carne asada ones and my husband loves the chicken tinga. They have a good variety  and this location has a beautiful and relaxing patio to enjoy. Dog friendly     P.s. order the horchata 
El Chilito,35,I was so happy when they opened.  It became my go to quick breakfast taco until last Sunday.  Waiting in line to order and sitting at the table nearby were 2 guys dressed in golf attire eating breakfast.  One guy was a particular loud mouth that proceeded to announce that whoever was driving that pos truck with the resist sticker on the back was just trash. I informed him that would be me. The resistance is real and NO ONE talks shit about my truck.  After he cussed me out I asked the guy at the counter if this was the kind of people they wanted as a Customer.  He said he didn t hear anything which was impossible unless he is stone deaf.  After receiving my order the same loud mouth verbally assaulted me again in the parking lot.  Too bad el chilito. You lost a neighborhood regular Customer for some 1 time suburban redneck that got lost looking for the golf course.
El Chilito,36,If I was equidistant to a Torchy s or Taco Deli  I would certainly go to one of those  but for the location and available options in the area  it s above average.  Pros     Consistent quality  good service   Breakfast tacos are always a winner   Good coffee hot chocolate horchata   Beautiful location  Cons    Overpriced extras on tacos salads  as many have already pointed out    Not much in the way of seasoning  leans heavily on the spices  of which there s really only one  there are two but I m not impressed with the green one    Not had good luck with the specials.  They re meh.
El Chilito,37,Ordered a Pastor Burrito  7.50   Al Pastor Burrito 8 . I don t know who taught these guys how to make burritos. The meat  tasteless  dry and Sad. Hipsters Heaven I guess. Go to El Secreto De Mi Abuela In the Cherry Creek Shopping center. They know how to cook and prepare your food. I don t know how El Chilito stays open. I guess that s why they have no management responding to 1 star posts 
El Chilito,38,Fast service  great atmosphere  and friendly folks. Tacos hit the spot.   The back patio is nice and relaxing. I ll probably hang out again soon.
El Chilito,39,We come here often  but I haven t gotten much further than the beef puffy tacos. I love them   The barbacoa soup is good too. My bf eats the cherrywood burrito consistently  he loves it. We live close and are regulars. I love that they don t put cheese on everything too. In the items we keep ordering  delicious.
El Chilito,40,El Chilito is my favorite place to stop for breakfast or lunch. Me and my partner come here regularly and while I can say the prices are a bit high  the quality of food is great and always delicious. The queso is so creamy and the chips are very thick and crunchy. 4 stars because the food is great but pricing is a bit high.
El Chilito,41,Love walking here the outside seating is really nice you don t have to come into contact w anyone and the food is really good
El Chilito,42,This is the first time that I have ever visited El Chilito. First impressions are everything  right   The place is cool and inviting. The staff was friendly. The tacos were disappointing. The bacon on my breakfast taco was burnt and the carne asada was dry.
El Chilito,43,I d been to the location on Manor for years when I lived near downtown  but after moving south I was pretty bummed out to lose El Chilito. Discovered this on Manchaca recently. Hopefully they haven t been open long as I ll have been missing out. It s not as  cool  as the Manor spot  but the food tastes identical to me. I ve been twice and everything was great.  Good feed  reasonably priced  and it comes out fast. Their puffy tacos are my goto and always come out perfect.
El Chilito,44,Felt over priced for what we got. My  11 ceviche was skimpy on the fish though the chips it came with were great. Didn t like the salsa one bit. The corn tortillas are cheap and tasteless. Carne asada was pretty tasty but nothing special. Not sure how we ended up spending more than  40 for dinner for 2 and left not feeling satisfied. Probably won t be back.
El Chilito,45,I m down for this place  I did know it was here  but keep forgetting bc  life. I like the setup  patio and parking. It has a nice feel that definitely plays to its neighborhood.  I m down for the Vegan options that are offered  always a     for my lifestyle. Venture here for the comida  but don t come thinking of the other location.  Menchaca is it s own style with the same great food and people 
El Chilito,46,El Chilito is criminally underrated  especially this location. My family loves these tacos.  Get the Barbacoa soup.
El Chilito,47,Used to be good. Got the Cherrywood with diced bacon for  4. If you like paying double for your tacos so the counter help can get tattooed after work knock yourself out . We re done.
El Chilito,48,Great location with plenty of parking and outdoor seating  but it just felt kinda... limp.  My breakfast plate wasn t terrible. The beans were tasty if not a little bland. The chorizo and eggs wasn t that flavorful. The tortillas for some reason were 90000 degrees. I forgot to add cheese. I really missed that cheese.  The hot sauce though. Not a fan. It was SUPER smokey. Almost like someone had burned a bunch of newspapers  blended them into a weak sauce of tobacco and spit and then portioned it out. Was really  really not good. 3 out of 4 of us didn t even use the 10 cups they foisted upon us. I suffered through it because my food was so bland that even a giant hit of wet smoke was better than nothing.  There are a 100 different places in a couple of miles that are better choices. Sorry.
El Chilito,49,It was clean and really just another Mexican walk into the counter place nothing  really stood out. Aaron described it just about right ...... felt limp.
El Chilito,50,Doo doo as hell y all. The building and outdoor area are cool. The food is blah. It s pretty expensive. Also  homeboy who cashed us out and brought our food didn t label anything we ordered. We asked him what was what and he was like  uhh... shrugs .  Lol okay byeeeee. C u never
El Chilito,51,Just terrible. The burritos are small  flavorless  horribly wrapped with the filling spilling out  and the salsa is just bad.   For  8- 10 burritos  you re better off going to Free Birds or Chipotle  or sadly  Taco Bell.   We ordered our meal to dine in  and they delivered them to us in a small to-go paper bag  mislabeled.  I wouldn t come back if you paid me. Yuck.
El Chilito,52,Cute little Chilito sitting on a little corner near my Casa. Best tacos in town  Nah. But they ARE good. Large menu of tacos and other schnackens. Soups and salads even. They serve breakfast tacos all day which is perfecto for late hungover mornings. Nice patio to kick back and gorge out on with your pup. This morning was accommodated by classic country being pumped thru the speakers. Loved it. Super nice service and their Smokey salsa is one of our faves.  The Charlie s Special  guisada  and migas   avocado are the best ones. And.... if you re feeling extra naughty... make any taco a PUFFY  Hard to find puffy tacos outside of San Antone  so that s a real treat...
El Chilito,53,El Chilito is now in our hood... so it becomes a weekly spot when we don t feel like cooking.  1.  It s pretty fast. 2.  I love their salads. 3.  I love their chicken Chipotle soup for cold days  yes  we had a few this winter   4.  They re always nice. 5.  They re always clean. 6.  I enjoy their coffees. 7.  My kids like their frescas.  We have been dozens upon dozens of times. There s been some inconsistencies with the food... but overall  we have been happy   It would be great if this location could sell drinks  but it s understandable they can t being so close to the school. Regardless  we are happy to support our neighborhood taco spot 
El Chilito,54,This place serves up a great cochinita pibil taco and the cold brew coffee isn t too bad  I ve visited 3 separate occasions and have consistently been impressed by their flavors.   I love their roasted  signature salsa  but I do have a complaint.. bottle it up and sell it already  The world  specifically Austin  needs more roasted salsas like El Chilito s.  Most recently  my husband ordered a nopales taco and it slammed. In our opinion  could ve used a little more nopal to dressings ratio  but nevertheless it was delish.  Also  I must confess  I can t stop ordering that damn cochinita pibil. Thanks for a good time  Chilito 
El Chilito,55,First time here. The location is great and the outdoor area is nice. I m a vegan so I love that they have options for me. I got the Brentwood taco on corn and the Black Bean soup  vegan . I was halfway done with my soup when I took a big spoonful and had to spit out my food.  There was pork in my soup. I immediately told the cashier and she offered to give me a free menu item but I didn t take it. She then offered to comp my meal which was very nice of her. I threw away the rest of my food. I was still hungry after that so I went to go order another Brentwood taco and a side of potatoes. She didnt charge me for that which again was really nice of her. I found mushrooms in my potatoes  thankfully it wasn t meat again .   I dont like the cross contamination of foods here. I wish it was separated a little better. The food is good. Might take me some time to come back.
El Chilito,56,I have been to this location at least 3 times. Each time  it went so south  that my partner was in a bad mood for the rest of the day  so if I return  I ll have to come by myself. And bring my own salsa.  The food is inconsistent  and poorly assembled. I got a burrito one time and it was put together so that it was impossible to get a bite of all the ingredients at once. All the vegetarian options are blah. Even the shrimp and fish tacos. It s like because it s not meat  they forgot to add any seasonings.  The salsa is crap. I m sorry. Being hispanic and originally from San Antonio  I consider myself a connoisseur. I even create my meals around what type of salsa I m in the mood for  green  red  or orange  etc. El Chilito s salsa is black  and tastes like burnt. And you only get the one option. I can t even really name another taco place in Austin that has only one salsa option.   They are pretty speedy each time we ve been  so we never had to wait long for our food. However  we are just so unimpressed  and there are so many better options for tacos around this area  that we probably won t return anytime soon. Although  I am a salsa slut  so if they change that  I may be persuaded.
El Chilito,57,We were super excited when they were building this place  and then we went and got breakfast tacos  many times  and they really were just sub par. the bacon was hard and overly salty  every time. nothing stood out for us here at all. i will say we have only eaten breakfast here  so i can say nothing about any other types of tacos.
El Chilito,58,After staring at this building every day for many months waiting for it to open  we finally got to go to the new El Chilito. I had never stopped at one of the other locations  but I have to say that I m a fan of this new location. We explained to my step kids  who are in town with us for the month from Virginia Beach where they have no good Mexican food  they tell us all the time   how long we had been waiting for it to open  so they desperately wanted to try it as well. I can tell we will definitely be returning with them before they head back to the land of bad Mexican TexMex.   I had two puffy tacos  and I thought that they were flavorful and delicious. I wished that I had gotten another one. My significant other got 3 different tacos  the puffy  a breakfast  and a camarones   and he liked all 3 but enjoyed the puffy the most. The kids had two pollo asado plates and the TexMex guisada plate. I tried meat from both the plates and thought it was pretty tasty  and the kids pretty much ate every bite. The portions aren t super large  but I think that it s a very Americanized idea that we need to have big a   burritos and monster tacos. If you re hungry  then order two and pay the price or go elsewhere. The place was also very clean  and I was glad that they had a serve yourself water out for the kids.   Bottom line  I m not running down the street screaming   I LOVE EL CHILITO   waving a burrito in the air  but it s pretty tasty and I can definitely see more visits or lazy garbage human Favor deliveries. Definitely give it a shot.
El Chilito,59,The go-to breakfast taco spot in the area  Simple but tasty  Their agua frescas are also delish.
El Chilito,60,So I have been a long time loyal customer of El Chilito and various locations.  I even used to drive in from San Marcos and Canyon Lake regularly just for their food.  I have noticed many of their locations have closed over the years  and the past several times I went to my favorite Manchaca Rd location have been less than great.  Today I went  and while I was thankful the cashier comp d the 11 cents my gift card was short  the corn tortillas my taco was in were absolutely rancid smelling  and the taco fell apart entirely upon picking it up before I noticed the rancid smell.  They downgraded their napkins at some point so it is comparable to using one-ply toilet paper squares for napkins  so for the first time tossed the inedible tacos and napkins and left.  Just a note  their paper fountain cups are cheap and leak the drink contents  and the fountain drinks themselves are watered down  so I have been bringing my own drinks for the last two years at least.  The picnic table I sat at also had a nice sticky film to it like when walking on a dirty floor.   Too bad if service  cleanliness and quality doesn t improve drastically.
El Chilito,61,I don t know how I managed to create the perfect bowl of deliciousness on my first try  but man did I ever. Their tofu is cooked exactly how I like it  crispy and not at all slimy. I found the beer selection a little weak  a few taps would have been perfect. Can t wait to go back  like seriously  today.
El Chilito,62,This place has been a super solid breakfast burrito spot for me. I recently made an annoying dietary switch to no dairy no meat  yes to eggs  - and the staff has been consistently really sweet and helpful suggesting options that fall into my dietary restrictions. They seem to really like their job and their customers and go that extra mile - I don t know her name but I want to call out the really cool girl with the fish tattoo on her arm - she s always super nice and enthusiastic.  I love that they offer espresso drinks  not many breakfast taco joints have that luxury. I get the Hot O special  a Mexican hot chocolate with an espresso shot  amp  Almond milk. Their salsa is the frickin bomb too 
El Chilito,63,I went here for some breakfast tacos and wasn t all that impressed  but today I had their Barbacoa taco and it was delicious . This place has great dinner tacos  breakfast are somewhat average.
El Chilito,64,I m just going to give this place a little love real quick  since they seem to have been getting a few overly harsh reviews here   I ve been a longtime El Chilito patron  used to live around the corner from the original  and I would say this stacks up to that quality and service nicely. Just had a delicious and fresh Migas taco from this one    I ve seen a few complaints about the salsa  but I ve always been a fan of the el Chile and el Chilito charred salsa- it s also kind of their signature. I usually take the extras home to use later  Maybe people are comparing to Taco Deli  but that s like apples and oranges  taco-style wise.  Also the interior space is really lovely  and they have a great covered outdoor area with some pretty oak trees  I think it s a great addition to the neighborhood  and if you re a fan of the original  I m sure you ll love this one too  
El Chilito,65,I ll give this place a try a few more times before I decide if this will be on our family s rotation for occasional take-out  but tonight s take out dinner was just fine. They got our family s order exactly right  everything was well-wrapped and stayed hot. All of the food was well-received by the family. I m not a fan of the charred salsa  but that wasn t a big deal to me because my tacos had enough flavor to make up for it. I wish there were some other salsas to choose from. Maybe there were others and I just missed them  I think I ll skip the puffy taco in the future. It s fine  just not really my cup of tea. On the other hand  I really liked the guisada taco. And heck   large  agua fresca is LARGE.  not convenience store giant cup large  but it s nothing to scoff at     I m looking forward to trying the cochinita pibil  more breakfast tacos  and hopefully some paletas down the road.
El Chilito,66,Ordered three breakfast tacos early this morning--I was the only person there at the time.. So i would guess it wouldn t be to hard for the guy to manage to take a order correctly... All three were made wrong...Forgot the potatoes on all three... All were flavorless and had a weird taste that was really unpleasant. Definitely won t be stopping by again.
El Chilito,67,3.5 stars is my preferred rating here... I m a long time fan of the Manor Road location. I used to go there a lot when I lived over there  but now I m a south-sider  and I was thrilled when the Manchaca location opened up....   However-- my first visit almost made me contact the business because I don t like writing bad reviews of local businesses. I know what a bad review can do to a place. Why would I have written a bad review  The SALSA. Seriously... it  was  so bad compared to the Manor location. I thought   isn t there one recipe for the salsa at all locations   Apparently not. How in the world could it be so incredibly different    I read another review that said it tasted like cigarette ashes were sprinkled in  and they weren t wrong  it was bad. The salsa at Manor is also a  little  smoky- but I LOVE IT    I decided to give them another try today   my 2nd visit  to see if anything had changed  and the salsa has DEFINITELY improved  I m not convinced it s the exact same salsa as at the Manor location  but it s close  On my first visit  I couldn t even take 3 bites of it.   I am so happy this location is in my neighborhood. I want to be a regular just like I was at the other location. All I ask is that the salsa be consistent with the El Chilito brand at all locations. Call the Manor crew for the recipe    Much love to you El Chilito  thanks for coming south  
El Chilito,68,For the price I spent.. Taco bell would have been better.. 7 dollars plus tax for a 4 inch by 5 inch burrito.. No seasoning... Surprised this place is still open
El Chilito,69,Good place for a quick taco before you start your day. They also sell burritos  think extra big tacos  and plates. Tacos are big enough for me as portions are generous.   I like migas in morning and picadillo in evening
El Chilito,70,Giving this place two stars bc the food is great  but the service is unbelievably awful. Food is a 5  service is a 0. Three straight times we went over the course of a couple months and each time they got our order wrong. We ordered bacon  egg and cheese. And potato egg and cheese. And three straight times we got food that was completely different from what we ordered. This shouldn t be possible. It s three damn ingredients. One time  Ok sure things happen. But three times  And one time we went and they just completely forgot a part of our order. That s beyond ridiculous. We ll never go back to this place again.
El Chilito,71,So I used to love this place and recommend it. Unfortunately the last few times I ve gotten food there it has been disappointing. 1. I think they changed there queso  and it didn t get better. But most of all their breakfast tacos are pretty sad now. My favorite was the Cherrywood because they used to put a good amount of their delicious cheese and bacon. That s why I kept coming back and ordering again. The last few times the two best ingredients are barely there  if at all. I figured maybe it was a one-off and the next time I d have my Cherrywood experience back. After trying several more times now trying to tell myself the same thing as the time before  it pains me to say this is how they roll now. Yesterday I gave it one last shot and bought two Cherrywood tacos which are supposed to have potato  egg  avocado  and bacon. I got two potato  egg and avocado tacos basically. Not delicious  not what I paid for. The taco in the pic is the taco with MORE bacon  I don t think the first one has any. As you can see it s a tiny amount. This flake of bacon was stuck to the outside of the taco like it accidentally hitched a ride and none was inside the taco. The yellow is the egg  I don t really see any cheese. Dude  El Chilito what s up  Why you doin  us like this  Please go back to putting the ingredients into the tacos so I can give you my money. For now  you ve lost some customers that didn t want to go   .
El Chilito,72,I had been looking forward to trying this place for some time now  considering I m a big fan of El Chile. Plus we need more places like this on the south side of town.   The tacos were good  not great. I had the Jamon breakfast taco  which lacked a bit of spice in my opinion. I have high hopes for anything with Serrano in it  but there really wasn t much heat at all. The carne asada taco was plain  just mostly dry meat and onions. Luckily I added avocado and topped it with the queso we ordered. The guisada taco was good  the meat was tender which I really liked and the flavor was traditional.   The biggest issue we had was the salsa... Salsa can really turn a plain  dry taco into something magical. The only salsa offered is their homemade charred salsa that is black in color  and just did not taste good at all. They said this was the only one they offer currently  which is shocking for any taco place. Especially in Texas. I heard 4 other people ask for a different salsa just during our visit alone. BYOS - bring your own salsa  folks.
El Chilito,73,First off when has anyone EVER put POTATOES in queso    I didnt receive SALSA   THE MEAT WAS BLAND ASF   amp  does anything come w  cheese      Worst taco place ive ever been to   Plus its not authentic anyways its a shitty twist
El Chilito,74,I was SO excited when El Chilito opened up    I have been to the other locations  and couldn t wait to have one nearby.  I have been repeatedly disappointed.  It seems a management problem  and maybe they all got burned out with opening it up  but please fix it.  The employees are despondent and rude and really don t seem to care.  The vibe is tense.    The first time  was ok.  I got the nopalito salad and it was great   Nothing else since then has been.  I had the worse fish        tacos EVER   It was like the were fried okra.  Small balls of fried something.  And the sauce was horrible.  Another visit  I ordered the barbacoa taco  and 1 2 of it was super cold  like the microwave didn t complete the heating.  Another time  with a chicken tinga taco  I had to spit out a bite as it was burned crisp.    I m not giving up hope that they will turn things around  but am tentative to go again. Luckily Papalote is opening up a new location close by   PS   the location is so needed  so that s why I gave it 2 rather than 1 star.
El Chilito,75,Love the bfast tacos here  They have many creative combinations so there s something for everyone. I also love that they have so many beverage choices from sodas  to coffee  to even horchata and chai tea lattes  Def a go-to 
El Chilito,76,Just placed an order  for pick up  of course . I ordered two tacos. My daughter  a vegetarian  ordered her usual--a Selena burrito. As soon as she took a bite  she realized the burrito was full of chicken. I called  went over the order with the person who answered the phone. He apologized and said he d have another burrito ready right away. We live just down the street but the burrito was still ready as soon as we got there. And the price of the burrito was refunded. Five stars for fast  great customer service AND delicious food. The pollo de tinga puffy tacos--YUM 
El Chilito,77,If you re going here for a simple breakfast taco and it s relatively early in the morning  go across the street to the taqueria in Beatniks and be amazed for  1.50 less per taco.
El Chilito,78,Not authentic Mexican food but definitely authentic to Austin. It s what you d expect for a trendy taco shop. I had a chicken puffy taco and a carne asada taco. The carne asada could ve used more flavor but the meat was tender and good. The puffy taco was pretty good. I ll most likely go back. Cute spot with outdoor patio seating.
El Chilito,79,I love this place.  The camaron tacos are great  as are the Brentwood  the Southwood  the Selena and everything else we ve tried here.  Service is good too.  We ve eaten here probably twenty times in the last year or so  and it s always been delicious.
El Chilito,80,We live in the area and were very excited when this location opened. Sadly  it has become a last resort option because the food is just subpar. I got a breakfast burrito here on Sunday that was lukewarm  the order was slightly incorrect too but not a big deal . It was take-out so I assumed it had just cooled down on my short 2 minute trip home. Well  12 hours later I had food poisoning. It turns out their last food inspection score is a 72  70 is a failing score . Clearly the owners and management  if there is any management - seems to be running on auto-pilot  are focused on their other endeavors  El Alma  Alcomar  El Chile  etc . It s a shame they have so little respect for what this place turns out  and for the neighbors who were excited to have them in our  hood. We will NEVER  EVER eat here again. If you value your health you will avoid this place as well.
El Chilito,81,This is such an unassuming little jewel in South Austin. The food is always super fresh  As I vegan I love places where I can easily eat and so can my friends and family that eat meat. Best fruit cup in town. The staff all seem to enjoy their jobs and are very helpful
El Chilito,82,Love love love  Super fresh  Super clean  I need more Carne Asada Puffy tacos in my life 
El Chilito,83,Everything I ve had at this place was incredible. I ve had the pork and green sauce  barbacoa taco  sausage egg and cheese  and several others. A must try place.
El Chilito,84,I honestly don t understand why El Chilito has poor reviews. I ve been there twice since it open and I ve had great experiences. The Carne Asada taco is my favorite and their aguas frescas are delicious. Is this my favorite taco place  Probably not but I think it s better than some other taco places in Austin that people rave about.
El Chilito,85,If you want a bland  non-authentic Mexican street taco  this is your spot  Bad service  food was lacking flavor or inspiration and price point was way off for expectations. Over-priced  meh experience and won t be back.
El Chilito,86,I think this place beats Torchies on their breakfast tacos burritos served all day and they make espresso drinks  Only down side is the chips  amp  queso  Not very good at all.
El Chilito,87,I can t believe I ve had to write a third review. I honestly didn t want to but their website would not let me submit feedback so  here I am. Verbatim from what I wanted to post  I didn t write a negative review  but for the second time in a row I went to the Manchaca location and the taco was not sealed properly  and grease dripped  and leaked through to the bag. Unfortunately this meant the bag was now unusable  and everything broke through  spilling grease and food all over myself and my car. It s really disappointing because there are a LOT of taco options in the area and El Chilito is more spendy than what is around but I find the flavor is worth it. I know it sound simple but your bad packaging makes me never want to go again.  1.5 at this point  rounding down to the 1.
El Chilito,88,Drove by a few times and it looked hip and trendy so I finally stopped in for a puffy taco and a breakfast taco - both were flavorless and had a weird taste that was really unpleasant. Definitely won t be stopping by again.
El Chilito,89,So sad to be writing this review. I ve been eating at El Chilito for years and have always had great service until tonight. I put in an order for 3 tacos and some guacamole and after sitting in an empty store for 15 minutes the girl at the front informed me that she actually never printed my ticket so no had been made. That usually would mean they are going to get to work with my order but no I watched as the 2 cooks continued to cook food for people who arrived after me. Normally this wouldn t be a big deal but as a stood waiting the 2 cooks in the back were horsing around and deliberately mean mugging me as if I m the annoyance here. To be made to feel that way when all you want is to eat some tacos is just a bit much. I ll be sticking to the other locations from now on.
El Chilito,90,I want to love this place so badly bc it s near our house and we want our neighborhood to be more walkable. But the tacos just aren t good    I love other locations  but we aren t hitting this one up regularly like we should be. Hoping they get better  Just lacking some good flavor and a kids playscape in the back  
El Chilito,91,It wasn t terrible  it wasn t amazing  it was... meh. The outside murals are very cute. The inside... meh again. The prices were a bit high for a To-Go taco plate in a plastic box.   Overall  a big strong meh.
El Chilito,92,What a find  Freshest  house salad  I ever expected to find at a modest-appearing Tex-mex cafe. I will be returning frequently to try out the rest of the menu  but just had to rave about this humble little salad. They do not hold back on the fresh avocado and shredded Mexican cheese  and the homemade cilantro ranch dressing had me back at the counter for more  cheerfully provided free of charge .
El Chilito,93,Tacos  Burritos to Plates   Yummy set of choices.  A place I d definitely come back to as often as I can.  The soup was luke warm but that s knowing that I like my food boiling and super hot. I wish there were more choices for meat but this was breakfast.  Have to come back for dinner and lunch.
El Chilito,94,Enjoyed this stop after waiting for them to open. We had lunch and went with tacos. The barbacoa was okay and my daughters  who choose veggie options  were happy with their tacos  as well.
El Chilito,95,No no no    No flavor  salsa was horrible and no costumer service. Nice decor though.
El Chilito,96,Picked up some quick tacos today- I got a Migas taco  breakfast all day  which was very flavorful and moist  and a Pollo Asado  chicken chargrilled taste with grilled onions  also tasty. I really like the dark brown mol  style salsa- just beware it s not Tex Mex  but give it a try  Really glad we have this location south side 
El Chilito,97,It s okay.  If Torchy s and Taco Shack are your thing  you ll like it.  If you re more into taquerias  not for you.
El Chilito,98,I will stick to ordering their breakfast after having a bad experience with their fish plate. The fish was served cornmeal friend and in small bits. Would ve preferred larger cuts of fish. The slaw was lack luster. I greatly enjoy the Chilito s breakfast burritos when had off of 7th. I ll give this location another try.
El Chilito,99,I came here just the other day in hopes I would believe the hype. I was really looking forward to the having dinner here. The carne guisada was very plain. Beans are good tho  Just was hoping for more flavor. I might be back in the future but I don t know. Best wishes El Chilito 
El Chilito,100,Ummmm  wow    I miss this place  I used to live close to the Manor location and now we live close to the Manchaca location  Yay  You guys never cease to make my day amazing  Pretty much everything on the menu is exceptional...Cheers to part one of our date night. Oh  and we brought our own IPA  tequila  etc for drinks bc it is byob- no fee associated with that  FYI
El Chilito,101,I like this place  and am very happy that they put a location near my house.  Unfortunately  this new location has some wrinkles to iron out.  At this point the tacos are hit or miss on how full they are.  You will get a taco that is too full to eat one day  and a taco that has very little in it the next.  I m sure they will figure this kind of thing out.  Overall  great menu of choices and quality ingredients.
El Chilito,102,Me and my husband finally stopped since one opened near our house in south Austin. Really relaxed chill vibe  outdoor seating and the tacos  were cheap and good. I went back this morning and had breakfast taco and a Mexican hot chocolate with espresso for  7. Enjoyed it and excited to have another relaxed spot that I don t have to drive downtown for.
El Chilito,103,This place is fantastic  The service  the location  environment and the food are top notch  I ordered the Pork Tomatillo and it did not disappoint  reminded me of Mexican cuisine at its best.
El Chilito,104,I do like this place but it closes before the posted time on the door often. Doesn t look good
El Chilito,105,This is my go-to place when I need a pick me up or have had a bad day. The tacos are always perfection  melt-in-your mouth tasty  the people are warm and friendly  and the outside seating is covered  perfect for Texas weather.
El Chilito,106,This was by far a great place to eat.  a plate and three different tacos so we can say we tried  a few items on the menu. Not one negative thing to say. Will be back to try breakfast next.
El Chilito,107,Please get better       We like El Chile and don t expect the East Side El Chilito to have such a following in a taco-centric city if the food is like this.  Helpful people people and decent digs  but the one time we went  the food was terrible.   Hard rubber shrimp- never had such a thing. Bland crust didn t relate to the shrimp  and the rest of the burrito  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fovershadowed.by amp s c060604e22b419fdcedf3ba214fe7f5e349d3d5ab8059900b3c061df91fa76ee  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  overshadowed.by  a  some thick  flavorless goo.  Gordita meats were bland   and so were the wraps themselves.
El Chilito,108,Simply delicious  I only wish the outside patio area was done up a little more  but they just opened  so I ll give them a pass. Keep up the good work   
El Chilito,109,My first experience with a Puffy Taco  so I was unsure if what I got was how a puffy taco was suppose to be. There was nothing puffy about it  it was flat  heavy  thick  gummy mess   just a very bad texture. I looked at the pictures of puffy tacos  even the photos on the El Chilito website were lighter and puffy  this was definately not what I got. I called El Chilito and asked if this is how it was suppose to be  the answer was yes  they make them different than most puffy tacos  he did say he was sorry I didn t like it. I have been there a little after 7 am  and they were closed  hey  this is Austin  we are almost Island time  I have been there to get a puffy taco and they were out  now  i finally get to try the puffy taco only to find it is gummy gross mess.  Everything else was fine  so I might try it again  just not get the puffy.  Puffy Taco s is what should make El Chilito stand out  this city is loaded with tacos.
El Chilito,110,Well  after passing this place every day I decided to stop in on a weekend. First of all  I thought this was a restaurant-you know  like a place you can sit down and eat. At least that was my expectation. So after ordering migas   I am on a migas tour so I can compare migas to migas   I sat down. Quickly I noticed that while the tables were beautiful  the chairs were very small hard metal and I do mean small. For a moment I wondered if they had recycled them from the day care that used to be there but I figured since I wasn t taking the chairs home with me to just put up with it. Since I ordered an iced tea and needed a straw i looked around for the trash after taking the paper off the straw. Nope-no trash in sight. Ok whatever  I guess they want you to take your trash with you or something. Then she called my name for my food which was in a take out container  which I had not ordered. Sooooo  I guess they don t want you to dine there either. So I left and took my food home. The migas were -average  the hot sauce looked like dirt and I never tried it.I immediately called my daughter who lived near by and I knew had eaten there. She said they don t want to deal with dishes so everything is in plastic.  Basically I predict this place will not last long. And I learned my lesson-always go to Maudies.
El Pollo Rico,1,Back again...  No haters please...  I have taken out from the one on Oltorf twice and the one at Riverside yesterday.  What a difference 3 miles makes.  I actually bought the Carne Asada plate each time and hands down...  The El Pollo Rico on Riverside gets my vote.  I suppose because it s new  but should that matter   I m giving this rating for the one on Riverside  not the one on Oltorf.  Honest y. they all need to figure out how to season a F n chicken.  This is not F n hard... Salt  pepper. onion  and perhaps a little spice like jalapeno of one of the 470 chili s out there.
El Pollo Rico,2, Sabroso  Not bad. Enjoyed it  went a second time  but wasn t as good as I had remembered. Great portions for the prices though
El Pollo Rico,3,You don t go here for service because it s usually pretty bad. You go here for the amazing chicken  grilled onions and sauce. If you re expecting courteous service then you re expecting too much. Get the whole chicken combo. So good 
El Pollo Rico,4,I was so impressed by El Pollo Rico. I had heard that their chicken was delicious  and I finally gave them a try. When I walked in  there was a short line  which I took as a good sign. On my turn  the lady was patient and professional as I gave her my order. I thought I might have to wait  but she came back with my order in minutes  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and juicy. I got the charro beans and they were the perfect in the warm tortillas. I will be back 
El Pollo Rico,5,Honestly after eating the food I can say with full confidence that s it s low grade Mexican food. Their agua fresca taste like ice cubes  and their tacos looks and taste like a 5th grader made it in a easy bake oven. I ve lived on the border and had real Mexican food that would make your mouth salivate. Do not eat here 
El Pollo Rico,6,Every location stinks and my stomach always hurts after I eat the food and o yes I m Mexican
El Pollo Rico,7,For the price of the food and the reviews I thought this place would be a great place to stop for lunch. We ordered the torta and parrilla plate  which does not come with beans rice or tortillas  and had to order small rice and beans. the quality and the quantity of food we got was very disappointing. Will never go there again  They have a place like this on Burkman its wayyyyy better and worth the drive. Will not be returning here again.   P.S the ONLY reason they got 2 stars was because the beans. They were the only thing that taste good.
El Pollo Rico,8,They changed their policy to call ahead orders have to be paid with debit or credit when placed. So if you pay with cash they won t make it till you go in and pay   On my lunch break I m in a rush and call ahead so it s ready when I get there.
El Pollo Rico,9,I dont know if anyone still likes this place but theyre always slow and act really retarded.  Food always tasted overcooked and over seasoned and theyre employees all seem to act like theyre new to the world. I waited 24 minutes for a torta special and afer all of that  they had to take a few more minutes just to repackage it because they forgot i had asked for it to go.   Im not sure why anyone would waste their time with this franchise
El Pollo Rico,10,The chicken is full of flavor and moist.  The beans are delicious and the green sauce is the bomb.  We will be back 
El Pollo Rico,11,Won t find a better deal on food in Austin.  Their chicken is extremely well seasoned and the value of the food is TOP notch. Getting pretty much two meals for  10 that s potentially nutritious and quick is great. For example  I typically get half a chicken  double fried plantain  yummy   and corn tortillas. Plus  they give this green  creamy salsa that I ve been trying to replicate the recipe for a while.  Would recommend 
El Pollo Rico,12,The chicken tastes so fresh and deliciously cooked. I can eat it everyday of the week if I had to. The drive thru line gets a little backed up during lunch time
El Pollo Rico,13,That whole chicken combo is pretty amazing  Perfect to share with a couple of people 
El Pollo Rico,14,I love their chicken and the price    I mean for 13 bucks I can feed up to four people with a whole chicken  grilled onion  tortillas  beans  rice  and salsa.    This place is like finger-licking chicken heaven.
El Pollo Rico,15,Stick to the chicken  it s delicioso   The charro beans are bangin too. Oh  I suggest an extra pack of tortillas when doing half and whole chicken orders.  The rice taste like the styrofoam they serve it in and the rest of the menu is seriously blah.    The atmosphere and staff are fast food like experiences that are just to be endured for your cheap and tasty hangover cure
El Pollo Rico,16,This isnt very good. Place is dirty. Staff seems unfriendly. Food is not that great.
El Pollo Rico,17,I love their baked potatoes well at least at the other locations. I went by this location this evening and got a baked potato it was tiny first of all compared to the other locations. Second it was hard like it had been cooking all day the potato part close to the skin was brown and hard. Potatoes are supposed to be soft and fluffy. So I called once I got home explained my issue and said my husband would come by and get a replacement. Once he got there they were extremely rude and made him feel like he was trying to steal a baked potato. They did not realize my husband spoke Spanish.They were speaking to each other  workers  in Spanish talking crap and being rude till him answered them back in Spanish they about freaked out. They finally replaced the potato with about the same quality horrible horrible I will never ever go back to this location.
El Pollo Rico,18,I gave the smell a try  eating in at Pollo Rico was not at about the aroma Don t be decived. The service is slow.The food was cold and their chicken portion was small. For the same price  I can go to HEB and get a whole rotisserie chicken and be happy at home.
El Pollo Rico,19,The worthy successor to a chicken legacy. After the fall of El Regio on this ground in the year of our Lord two thousand and eight  the triumphant army of East Austin lead by the mysterious figure El Rico  stepped in to fill the power-void left when the great Regio fell.  But shed no tears for the fallen  my comrades...for El Rico brings with him the secrets of Chickencraft as well. It has been widely whispered that El Regio and El Rico were once brothers  each learning from the same Sage who taught them the secrets. No one knows what caused the rift that eventually lead to the fall...but fear not...the chickens integrity is intact.  And let us not forget the speech given by El Rico  just before the final battle  transcribed herein...and remember his words well    We few  we happy few  we band of smoked chicken loving brothers       and sisters       For he or she to-day that sheds his blood with me     Shall be my brother or sister  be he ne er so vile   but wash your hands before you prepare the chicken      This day shall gentle his condition      And gentlefolk in West Austin now-a-bed     Shall think themselves accurs d they were not here      And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks     That cooked with us upon Saint Chicken s day    El Regio is dead. Long Live El Rico  And worry not...for the Green Ambrosia carries on    written in a fit of chicken-induced madness
El Pollo Rico,20,I ve been curious about the various El Pollo Rico outlets  so I ordered a whole chicken with sides.   The chicken was fantastic  falling-off-the-bone tender and full of charcoal-grilled flavor. I have never eaten such delicious chicken in my life. The beans and rice were completely inedible  Don t order a whole meal.
El Pollo Rico,21,Don t judge a book by its cover. Even if it s a very ugly  garish  scary cover.   We got the family meal with a whole chicken  two sides of beans  two sides of rice  a grilled onion  salsa  green sauce  a lime  tortillas  and TWO Pepsis    This fed four people   Chicken  delicious and juice  and pretty healthy tasting when compared to other fast food pizza places. I haven t tried the grilled chicken at KFC so I can t really compare.  rice  very moist and tasty  beans  they were cooked with jalapenos and meat  so they tasted like jalapenos and meat. mmmmmmm.  Salsa  WATCH OUT  VERY SPICY   Green sauce  I have no idea what was in it  but it was creamy and a little spicy.  I know it looks dubious  but if you muster the courage  you won t regret it 
El Pollo Rico,22,Nom Nom Nom   Get a whole chicken cooked in spices and oils that are delicioso...with side of rice  beans  limes  2 kinds of salsa  green is napalm hot   tortillas and a grilled onion.   13 bucks.  You can make 4 plates out of this.  Friggin  awesome.   It seems there s always a child chasing and feeding pigeons outside.  He s having a blast and so is everyone that s watching him.  Everybody wins.
El Pollo Rico,23,You cannot go wrong with El Pollo Rico.   Buy a whole chicken that is chopped and comes with whole onion that is cooked. Also it comes with charred beans which are pinto beans mixed with jalepenos  tomatoes and onion  rice and some corn tortillas that are not rough and dry. There s the red salsa which is not hot but the green salsa which is really hot.  I ordered some potato salad because for some weird reason when I have chicken I have to have some sort of potato whether it is salad or mashed form.  It is a great dinner to have when you hate fast food. I just had to knock it down a star because I wish the sides had larger portions.
El Pollo Rico,24,El POLLO DELICIOSO        This place is amazing. The chicken will bring you in and the price will bring you back.   The whole charcoal grilled chicken with all of the sides  tortillas  beans  rice  a grilled onion  and limes for 16 bucks is an absolute steal. I have tried to buy all of these items at the store and I come out more expensive. The great thing about it is that you can get it from a drive thru. My girlfriend and I can each get 2 meals from the whole meal. If you don t have that many mouths to feed don t fret they also have a 1 2 chicken option.   If you like chicken and haven t tried this place give it a go  I guarantee you will not be disappointed.   I have also had one of the tortas when I was on lunch from work and they are also spot on but to be honest you would be doing yourself a disservice to not order the chicken.
El Pollo Rico,25,I never made time to come here... but once I did  I don t think I ve ever made a better decision in my life  besides significant life-changing ones...Eating in 90 degree humidity without water or a sweat rag is a big uncomfortable.  This place only does take out  and they have a few benches you can sit on.  After having tasted numerous other restaurants   chicken   this is by far the best I ve had anywhere.  The concept of selling whole Mexican-spiced chicken as a large pre-cooked meal is still sort of new and somewhat innovative to me  but I do enjoy it very much.  For  7  you can get a half chicken with an onion  frijoles  rice  5 tortillas  salsa  and the gee-wilikers-sauce.  You know the chicken has to be good when the butcher paper that it s wrapped in is translucent with neon-orange grease.  Sure enough  upon opening the package  the chicken tore into tender pieces.  Even the breast meat yielded juicy  flavorful chicken.  Sides were as good as any.    But this sauce.... this outrageous sauce....  you are probably familiar with it  but I have to describe it again.  A green  heavenly  creamy concoction with quite a zip.  Put this on anything and it will be delicious.  Green sauce.  Period.
El Pollo Rico,26,I cannot put into words the sheer mouth numbing deliciousness that is EL POLLO RICO    the simplistic concept of an awesome Mexican smoked anchochili rubbed chicken that tastes like it danced with the gods and imbibed ambrosia. honestly the greatest chicken Ive ever tasted and I m from a west Texas town known for Mexican. it comes on a sheet of butcher paper like you were south of the border along a coast somewhere  all to contain with juiciness of the meat. for a half order around 7 they also throw in some of the best tasting burracho style beans Ive ever encountered.... honestly i don t even try it anywhere anymore cause Ive been ruined. rice is also included decent taste but compared to the beans and chicken its more just the backdrop.    i have personally hated their corn tortillas ever since i started eating there  however i recently discovered that you can ask for their bad ass flour tortillas instead. and if you ve ever tried one of their equally good quesadilla  i like carne  but Ive had the pork and it aint bad either  then you know that the tortillas are worth asking for.  Ladies and gentlemen  Ive saved this last tidbit because it is the best. Prepare yourselves for the intense ecstasy and euphoria that is brought about by their green sauce. it has no other name because it needs none  its not one of those pretentious sauces  however in my mind it re-defines the entire green sauce category in a delightful way.  never done a review before but man  i just had to say something about this awesome awesome place.  ......even after i just finish writing this  i totally forgot to mention the guacamole  which has changed my gf s mind about eating the stuff  and their freshly made crunchy chips which go well with the red salsa....
El Pollo Rico,27,Eating chicken here is like having chicken for the very first time. Everyone else is a mere imposter. Crack open a rotisserie chicken and strick gold.
El Pollo Rico,28,Oh my god - I do love the Pollos Asados   What can you say really  Whole roasted chicken with awesome green salsa  tortillas  rice and beans - not to mention the whole roasted onion . Awesome.  yes - I am in fact in awe of this food .  De-licious   Extra Bonus Points for the drive thru window.
El Pollo Rico,29,I know everyone raves about the chicken  but you simply must try the beef taco grande.   Let me tell you a little about this magnificent form of sustenance. It s messy. It s slightly greasy. It s bursting with flavor. You will want it every day for the rest of your life. Well  as long you don t mind the colorful east riverside  company. Instead of giving someone you see on the corner some change  for the bus  or a cigarette  buy them one of these babies.  on to the taco  the goodness is wrapped inside a burrito sized corn tortilla  hence the name grande . The tender  smoky  shredded beef  is mixed with freshly made pico de gallo and ample scoops of guacamole. This  in its own right  is awesome. But dig further into that paper bag  and you will find a half of a lime wrapped in foil.gently open the taco  and squeeze it over all the fillings. Then you ll find a generous ly sized container of the much raved over green sauce.  Pour over your taco  feel free to drink any you don t use. Begin eating  but make sure that in between bites of the taco  you re taking bites of the fresh jalapeno that came with it.   Now  go forth and enjoy your taco.  Don t worry that your face and hands are covered in salsa and guac. We all understand. Now throw back a mexican coke and get back to work 
El Pollo Rico,30,Oh Pollo Rico  how I love thee   This is some awesome  finger licking  mind alteringly good freaking chicken.  i work close by and my employee brought me their chicken 10 months back and that s when it all started.  I opened up the butcher paper to unveil 4 pieces of chicken and a slightly charred whole onion.  There were 2 containers of salsa  one a creamy green and one a red.  One container of rice and one of charro beans.  Also a foil wrapped package of corn tortillas.    The chicken is amazing.  I know many reviewers claim the true glory of Pollo Rico is in its green salsa  but I believe it is in their chicken.  I don t know what seasoning is on that chicken but it is GOOD.  There is definitely some citrus  maybe lime   cumin  Crack   I salivate just thinking about it.  Don t get me wrong the green salsa is crazy good  though it may be a little hot for some people.  I love it  but think the red salsa is the red-headed step child of the whole eating experience here.  I really think it adds a nice fresh quality to the meal that can be heavy without it.    I usually don t give two cruds about the rice and beans when I eat Mexican food  but this is an exception.  The beans are soooo good.  They put bacon and sausage in them and they are seasoned well.  They are typically not very spicy  which is good because this is where the super spicy green salsa comes in handy.  The rice is also quite good.  Unlike many Mexican joints it actually has flavor  who knew    I do have one gripe.  The tortillas.  They are the typical store bought corn tortillas that are nothing to write home about  but when wrapped around some of the chicken with a chunk of the nicely cooked onion dipped in the green salsa and you have one good meal  so I m not going to complain too much.  Be prepared to speak Spanish as most of the employees don t speak English.  And it s not exactly in the best neighborhood.  Be prepared for some interesting propositions from locals.    So if you re ever off of Riverside  you can pick up a hooker  buy some dope  and get some of the best darn chicken in the world.  Now that s a good time.
El Pollo Rico,31,We affectionately refer to this joint as  chicken window.   When my husband told me he was going to go get some chicken from a trailer I was initially wary.  Upon tasting  I was  not only pleasantly surprised  I was DELIGHTED.  And wanted it again.  The next day.  And the next.  But I digress. Chicken  grilled onion  lime  rice  and beans.  All of it will rock your socks.  The lime is an IMPERATIVE addition to your taco or chicken in whatever form you choose to eat it... thou shalt not forget the lime.  USE the lime.   My dad is coming in town this weekend and asked  anywhere new we need to go     CHICKEN WINDOW    Oh that s right.  I m taking guests. Cheap  fast  delicious.  Some of the best chicken I ve ever had.
El Pollo Rico,32,Delicious    I live nearby and have always been curious about the place. I finally decided to give it a shot last Friday and was a little intimidated by the price   6.99 for a half chicken.  Having heard wonders about the place  I plunked down the money and was handed a hefty little plastic bag of goodies.  When I got home  I found the half-chicken  charcoaled to perfection  meat falling of the bone. Half of a grilled onion inside the chicken package  a container of rice  one of beans  a set of tortillas and 2 things of hot sauce  a green and a red one. Once you break that down  it s actually a great value for the money.  The chicken itself is making me hungry just as I m typing this. The rice tasted fresh  which for some reason the Taco Cabana down the street can never get right  and the beans were awesome  They had a couple of pieces of sausage and pork fat in it  just like my nana used to make.  I am definitely going back there  Screw taco cabana  although their rotisserie chicken is also delicious even if the sides leave much to be desired.
El Pollo Rico,33,I ve lived in South Austin for over 15 years now and just had my first Pollo Rico experience.  I give it a 2 word review  Yum diddly.  I got the whole chicken with rice and beans. All were good  but the salsas rock.
El Pollo Rico,34,2 words    Crack chicken   I even the lick the butcher paper when we are done because I need my fix so bad    Ok fine   I use my finger to lick it because my bf thinks I am freak when I try to just lick the paper.   My sweetie and I love this place. I have been eating here since it was El Regio. It was a tad bit better back in those days but whatever. If I can t have El Regio I ll take Pollo Rico.    I am finallyyyyy starting to just eat the corn tortillas they give you when I am feeling lazy and don t want to stop at HEB for fresh flour ones.   Lately the limes have been a little dried out so I usually grab a couple of of those at HEB too.   He say the beans are really good. I don t really eat beans but the rice is decent. Nothing special.  And he likes and our other friends eat the green gauc salsa.
El Pollo Rico,35,Never again. First time I tried it there was a hair in my food. Second time I tried it the food did not have any flavor and the food tasted like it was reheated.
El Pollo Rico,36,Maybe beef tacos was the wrong decision and based on other reviews I ll give the chicken a try...but the beef tacos were horrible. Saturated in grease I felt like I was at a Mexican McDonalds. There s so many awesome food trucks that put this place to shame- far as beef tacos. First experience was not good. I wound up degreasing the meat when I came home and used my own tortillas. The green sauce is to die for  Doesn t taste any different than any other green sauce in my opinion. I ll take del taco over this any day. Bummed....
El Pollo Rico,37,The chicken is awesome. Wonderful grilled  marinated flavor.  Rice and beans - not so much.
El Pollo Rico,38,First time I  discovered  Pollo Rico was smelling it on someone else s plate  and desperately trying not to drool. The smell is intoxicating  every time I eat here I wonder why it s not for every meal.   You could call this my favorite  fast  food kind of craving in town.Awesome grilled chicken on the cheap  every month or so we have to make a trip out here to get some food to go. Also get some extra onions  those things are culinary gold.
El Pollo Rico,39,Excellent food and decent prices. All in all the whole experience was excellent. We will be back but the only we didn t like was long it took the kitchen to get our food out to us. I realize this wAs the waitress fault but more so how packed the place was with other customers. Excellent place just slow food delivery  Thanks for everything And we when see you soon  my husband and I mean it        
El Pollo Rico,40,Yes it looks shady  but the food is soooo legit    I still dream about this place. One of my good college memories from when your wallet is thin because all of your   is going to the University Co-op.  They don t give enough tortillas so I d recommend ordering more. The green sauce................................
El Pollo Rico,41,Delicioso   the whole chicken    that s what you have to get. The green creamy salsa is to die for  . Cheap and good  hell yeah 
El Pollo Rico,42,I love food trucks    I lived in the border with Mexico for 10 years  so I m a little picky with my tacos. Was ok. A bit pricey for the quality. I would go back.
El Pollo Rico,43,So I guess I should have been wary when the cashier that took my order told me that she didn t have a favorite menu item.  Maybe I should have had the chicken  but instead I tried the steak tacos.  Waaay over cooked  and frankly  bland.  The red salsa was also flavorless.  The tacos are simple  steak  a touch of raw onion  and some cilantro on white corn tortillas.  They re not a lost cause  but you ll want to add cheese or some guacamole  and some pico de gallo.  The kids had the flautas   don t bother.  Almost flavorless  with dried out  super bland chicken.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because I still want to try the chicken.  They really need to up their game  however.  Better customer service is a quick  easy fix  and so is salt  amp  pepper in the cooking process.
El Pollo Rico,44,after calling in an order at Taquerias Arandinas and finding out they didnt have any Psoloe  i ventured to El Pollo Rico in search of a speedy substitution. i have seen a few of these throughout Austin  and being a fan of El Pollo Loco and Chicken Pirata in Houston  i figured it was a tangable comparison. the only thing that worried me - everytime i drove by  there was never anybody there eating.   in a pinch and trying to pickup lunch to meet my GF on her break  i swung through to give it a try. i was very glad i did  especially since i was the first and only car in line. i went for the Half Chicken Combo  as well as the Carne Guisada Combo. they didnt have ice tea  but i got a canned soda and an Orange Jaritos instead. i soon realized why there is never anyone in line or waiting for food  because they are super fast with service. even though they told me to pull around  usually the first clue at a drive through that you wont be getting your food anytime soon  i had both orders in hand and on my way in less than 2 minutes.   the Chicken was great. heavily seasoned with both dry rubs and marinade  and grilled perfectly. i love bone-in skin-on chicken  and this was up there with the greats. moist  tender  smokey and charred. the beans are great  stew-style with tomatoes and onions in a heavy broth. the rice is also authentic Spanish style and super fluffy. the Carne Asada was a bit dry  but very flavorful and a generous helping. the total meal was  19  with 3 drinks  and we have enough leftovers for dinner tonight between 2 of us. each combo plate came with all the fixings - corn tortillas  pico  lime  red and green salsa  some of the best green salsa i have had  and an amazing whole grilled onion that set the whole meal off.   if you are looking for no-frills south american style rotisserie chicken and some GREAT beans... on a budget  check it out. i will definitely be back  El Pollo Rico is going into the hot rotation...
El Pollo Rico,45,I love there breakfast sandwiches every time I walk in the place is very clean and there customer service is excellent.
El Pollo Rico,46,This chicken is off the chain good.  I order an extra onion and extra green sauce. Don t stray from the chicken--all other items are only so-so.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that occasionally you get chicken that s a tad dried out.  If you are trying this place for the first time and that happens  give it another chance.  When it s on  it s ON.  In my house we call it  The Chicken   because no other words are needed. I took it to a potluck one time and someone I didn t know came up and hugged me.
El Pollo Rico,47,The whole chicken meal is amazingly delicious and is plenty of food for 2 for only 15 bucks. It comes with 8 pieces of grilled spiced chicken  6 tortillas  rice  beans  awesome green and red salsa and a grilled lime and onion. I haven t anything else there because this is too good to pass up. Everything is cooked to perfection and served very quickly by drive thru.
El Pollo Rico,48,When I lived down on Riverside and Royal Crest I could smell this place from my apartment 4 blocks away. I always felt like bugs bunny being lead by my nose to go get some tasty chicken.
El Pollo Rico,49,Chicken Quesadilla comes in a pizza box and is good for two meals  unless you want to get fat  then you can eat it all at once.  Be sure to get some of the salsa dona with that.  The whole and half chickens are good too.  This place will make you fat.
El Pollo Rico,50,Once El Regio  this place now has beef on the menu. Everything still tastes great  but the green sauce no longer burns and causes such pain. It was delicious pain  though my lips hurt.  I always get the half-chicken meal. It comes with not enough tortillas  but a fair amount of rice and bean and a whole grilled onion. I love that onion and hate to share it. It is enough for two people and a fantastic price.
El Pollo Rico,51,I don t know what they do  but they do it well.  The  1 roasted chicken with all the sides is a  must have .  And the green sauce is amazing  so hot but you can t stop eating it.  Definitely the next level from your standard roast chicken and best of all  these folks are open late so you can drive through any time you have a craving...
El Pollo Rico,52,Wow    I couldn t put the 1 2 chicken  beans  rice and especially the onion in my mouth fast enough    I will be back over and over and over again.
El Pollo Rico,53,Wow   Their chicken is the best  I also tried their papa asada...that is my favorite...yummy   My children love this place. There beans are awesome as well. Oh and there green salsa...delicious.
El Pollo Rico,54,This place is awesome   Under  15 to feed the whole family  and they re so quick about it.  Before they expanded their menu  all they would say when you drive up is  whole chicken or half chicken    We get the whole chicken  so juicy and well smoked  .  Just unwrapping it after bringing it home fills our whole house with the awesome smell of smokey delicious chicken.  It also comes with rice  beans  tortillas  a cooked onion  and lime.
El Pollo Rico,55,Awesome roasted chicken for cheap.   a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fthefatartery.blogspot.com 2F2011 2F04 2Fel-pollo-rico-austin-tx.html amp s 1b284aa27a7c399391e7c27af8376d599fa97e2cff15a1c2a36bd6ef4b6a6450  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  thefatartery.blogspot.co   a 
El Pollo Rico,56,My brother and I were talking chicken.  The kind that comes with tortillas and beans and rice.  So I looked for a chicken shack on Yelp that was close by  and went here.  I m glad I did.  I got a half chicken  it came with tasty pinto beans that had onions and peppers  a tub of rice  5 tortillas  and red and green salsa.  The chicken was probably 5 or 6 pieces of grilled chicken on the bone.  Overall  everything was really good.  i ve had better chicken  but this was good.  The beans stood out  but the chicken was tasty.  The rice was decent and the salsas average.  It ran me about  7.50 and I couldn t finish it by any means.  So overall  it was good  but there s better  cheaper food in Austin.  But not a ton of chicken stands  hence the 4 stars.  One thing about this place though is they have no indoor seating  and that kind of sucks.  It s not a great area by any means  and right after I sat down outside to eat at a picnic table  a woman came up asking for some chicken for her husband and her.  She was clearly down and out and homeless.  The thing is  I was hungry and hadn t eaten a thing and wasn t going to give her my tub of beans or a couple pieces of chicken.  So I politely declined  she made some snide comment  and all was good.  But I was thinking about it  and felt bad.  I was going to find her and give her my leftovers.  So I made sure to leave a couple of tortillas  some chicken  beans  rice  salsa  packaged it up nicely  and put it back in the bag.  I saw her sitting across the parking lot with a man  I walked over there and said that I left them some of everything and they were both thrilled to pieces and extremely thankful.  So I felt good and they could eat another meal.  I just would ve preferred to have the option not to be solicited while eating at a restaurant at noon on a weekday  but the same thing happens fivefold whenever I walk up Congress  generally Save the Earth  Save a Whale  Save a Child  Save my Cat  etc   any day or time of the week.  So is life I guess.  By the way  based on the picture  this is not the place I went to  mine was like an isolated restaurant with outdoor seating only.   Sign looks the same though.  Yet I could sware it was El Pollo Rico.  So since El Regio has the exact same address on Yelp  maybe they bought El Regio or moved.
El Pollo Rico,57,Oh my goodness  This place is amazing.  Too bad I discovered it a few months before moving away from the area. The charcoal flavor of the chicken and carne asada is SO good.  The prices are really great too. Two of us usually get beyond full for about 12 bucks   I don t care that I don t live down the street anymore  I still keep coming back
El Pollo Rico,58,da best chikkin evur
El Pollo Rico,59,Quick  awesomely satisfying staple food here    The chicken is outstandingly well-seasoned and -cooked  and the beans are delicious. Skip the carne asada  which is gristley and comparatively bland. The mildly spicy green sauce is a good complement to the meal  even if calling it guacamole is little more than a bad joke. This doesn t quite replace Zankou Chicken from my time living in LA  but it comes close.
Un Taco Mas,1,waiting to check into the holiday inn next door  without transportation the front desk recommended un taco mas over delivery.   it did not disappoint   i was over whelmed and just ordered a beef quesadilla - it s huge  amp  delicious. the beef is seasoned well  amp  not over cooked.
Un Taco Mas,2,Good place to get some food. My kid loves bean and cheese and even though we think that s fail proof  it isn t.  She opted for the AL Pastor and birria and she wants to return every time we come to Austin  The tacos have plenty of meat  love the chopped crunchy onions  cilantro is plentiful and the homemade corn tortillas  No words. The Chile is good and spicy and service is fast. Try it out but be prepared to develop a habit.
Un Taco Mas,3,I ve wanted to try the tacos from  Un Taco Mas  for a long time but for some reason I hadn t had the opportunity  I was finally able to go and the truth was that it didn t disappoint  initially my friend Jimmy and I had a craving to try the breakfast tacos but unlike other establishments  these are only prepared in the morning  so it was the turn of ordering the classic chicken fajita  a birria taco  both green and red roast  Asado   all accompanied by green tomatillo sauce that gave it a little spiciness. the tacos were in a double corn tortilla so 3 were enough to fill that craving in the middle of the afternoon  the place offered enough space to sit down and was easily accessible  in the case of those drinks  they need to be bought at the gas station since  A Taco Mas  only sells food  although this establishment does accept payment by bank card  definitely a recommendation for those days when you crave tacos.  Hace tiempo que quer a probar los tacos de  Un Taco Mas  pero por alguna raz n no se hab a dado la oportunidad  al fin pude ir y la verdad no decepcion   inicialmente mi amigo Jimmy y yo ten amos antojos de probar los tacos de desayuno pero a diferencia de otros establecimientos estos solo se preparan en la ma ana as  que toc  el turno de ordenar la cl sica fajita de pollo  un taco de birria  el asado tanto verde como rojo  todo acompa ado de salsa verde de tomatillo que le daba un peque o picor  los tacos fueron en doble tortilla de ma z as  que 3 fueron suficientes para llenar ese antojo en plena tarde  el lugar ofrec a suficiente espacio para sentarse y de f cil acceso  en el caso de las bebidas esas se ocupan comprar en la gasolinera ya que  Un Taco Mas  solo venden comida  aunque este establecimiento si acepta pago con tarjeta bancaria  definitivamente una recomendaci n para esos d as de antojo de tacos.
Un Taco Mas,4,Stopped by here while I was staying at a nearby hotel because of the convenience of location. They ran out of everything except for fajita beef tacos. So we decided to try those since they happen to be my favorite  and I have a good gauge for the taste of fajita taco meat.  I ordered 4 beef on flour  cilantro  and cheese... no onion. Guess what I got  Onion. In addition  the meat was a really low grade and not seasoned. It also was extremely tough and chewy  a lot hard fat or tendon.   I don t know that I would ever come back  not even at my hungriest. The gas station close by sells trail mix that I d take over these tacos any day.
Un Taco Mas,5,Started craving tacos THE MINUTE I landed in Austin and found this food truck parked next to my hotel. They offer a variety of breakfast tacos   regular tacos  gorditas  burritos etc. and about 6 platters. Service was prompt and friendly. Tacos were delish  I had 2 ground beef tacos on flour tortillas with some added avocados. I love spicy salsa  and their spicy is muy caliente SPI-CY    Like my-nose-is-sweating-a-little spicy  Good flavors  hit the spot. Would def try them again.
Un Taco Mas,6,Right next to the Holiday Inn - Town Lake  This taco truck on the corner of a gas station. Let me tell you this food truck is fantastic .  -Taco shells is handmade  you can tell by the texture and  the freshness.  -Tripas is savory and crispy. -Barbacoa is very flavorful and juicy. -Beef fajitas is tender and delicious. -Sauce is spicy and fresh.  I gave this one full 5 stars  so good 
Un Taco Mas,7,Omg this place is unbelievably delicious  We were shocked to find that our order of 4 tacos was only  10  that means each taco is only  2.50   We stumbled upon this because it s parked right next to the Holiday Inn In Town Lake where we re staying and it is better than some of the other popular tacos we had in Austin    I m coming back downstairs to get more because I can t stop eating it. The two sauce that came with it gave it a nice spicy kick. with the cilantro and onion was a flavor explosion. The meat was juicy and made fresh to order so it was hot and delicious. This is my kind of taco  Flavorful  juicy  spicy and cheap    There is no pricing on the menu and the menu is all in Spanish  that s how you can tell it s authentic Mexican food anyway    but that didn t stop us from getting recommendations from the owner who was very pleasant and friendly.   We are pleasantly surprised since there weren t much reviews and hope everyone gives this good truck a try when you re in Austin. I m guessing it s a start up but I m sure the lines will stretch down the block once people taste these tacos 
Un Taco Mas,8,Found this little hidden spot by the airport as they have a permanent location now and I have to say this is pretty damn close to authentic it is very delicious and definitely worth the entire. Everything is so nice and hot into your taste so it is absolutely worth stopping in and getting to know. I had the steak and chicken tacos the portions are adequate with more than enough me to satisfy and the food was very warm. I absolutely recommend that you stop in and have a bite to eat here
Un Taco Mas,9,Everything from this truck is handmade with love  and you can tell. I got to try a sampling of different tacos  and the tripas were my favorite with the homemade salsa macha  which is really spicy  There are a few other unique items on the menu like chicharr nes prensado  which is pressed slices of chichar n cooked in a red sauce. I m excited to come back to try the handmade sopes and menudo on Saturdays. Muchos tacos mas 
Un Taco Mas,10,Way better than Torchy Tacos and Chipotle. Everything hand made. I recommend the asada bowl.
Un Taco Mas,11,The Al Pastor tacos were amazing. I would definitely recommend to try if your ever in the area.
Un Taco Mas,12,If you re in downtown Austin and need to fill that taco shaped hole in your belly then look no further than Un Taco Mas. This authentic Mexican food truck makes some the best tacos in ATX. Not only is the food amazing  but the owner and staff are extremely friendly too. I highly recommend everything on the menu 
Un Taco Mas,13,Great guys  great tacos. Amazing red salsa. Fantastic location  right next to our hotel. As good as their food is  they could be charging much more than  2.50 a taco. Half the fun of a taco truck is the atmosphere and conversation with the workers owners.
Un Taco Mas,14,Delicious  Tender fajita beef with fresh ingredients  fabulous tortillas and the Chevron next door sells Huberts Blackberry Lemonade...almost like a margarita    A fun quick stop right on I-35 for a taste of Austin without having to pull our uhaul trailer through downtown to SOCO or South Lamar 
Un Taco Mas,15,I hope others can offer reviews of this food truck because the owner does a wonderful job here. He s very polite and the food is excellent. I ordered the enchiladas plate and it was delicious  much in line what you d expect when ordering authentic Mexican food. Prices were very reasonable  and I wish I had taken a picture prior to the meal. A lot of seating was available under a large text  though I ordered to go. Orders are accepted ahead of time by calling the phone number provided. There were reviews and pictures on Google for Un Taco Mas  and I hope the reviews expand to Yelp. Thank you very much for the meal  I will be back time and time again in Austin.
Un Taco Mas,16,Authentic food at great prices. Where else can you get dinner for two for under  20  I love the tacos and hubby usually as the fajitas plate. I ve never had a bad taco from this spot  but the chicharron prensado are my favorite.
Un Taco Mas,17,Swung by for breakfast tacos. Tried the egg and potato and egg and bacon. They were both delicious. The green sauce was mild and really good. The red was too hot for my sensitive palate. Everything was made fresh and served hot. Would definitely recommend  
Un Taco Mas,18,I m not from the area and have been experimenting with taco spots. This was one of the best  Thank you for dealing with my pickiness lol. We spent 8-9 on 3 tacos  very good prices. I ll definitely be stopping by again before I head to the airport.
Un Taco Mas,19,The tacos are out of this world good  I had the al pastor  azado verde  amp  a beef taco  The al pastor was my favorite  The owner was very helpful  Food was super affordable fresh  amp  delicious 
Taco Flats,1,attentive service  didnt get busy until like 6 30 on friday - i was thrilled  great food - love the fish tacos and the agua fresca was nice and light
Taco Flats,2,Wanted to try out something new and it was pretty disappointing. The price of the food doesn t reflect on the service The good  margaritas  chips  salsa  amp  guac The bad  cold hard yellow queso.. which I thought was white when I last checked Yelp. Also I guess the prices already went up from the last time I checked too. The birria taco has potential but was really cold  amp  the steak taco was so greasy. The brunette waitress only got us 2 rounds of drinks  amp  never came back for our food order or another drink. We kept seeing her go into the bathroom  amp  checking on her other only one top table and talking to her coworker and just flat out ignoring us. Eventually I waved her down so she could come take my order. A different girl brought out our food and then I saw her grab a drink from the bar  amp  go sit outside without ever saying anything else to us.. not sure if I ll be back anytime soon after the terrible service and cold food
Taco Flats,3,Food was fine. Kind of expensive. Place seemed to be very out of order. I don t understand because the place wasn t even full. Took 40 min until I was asked what I wanted to eat. And then  they didn t provide napkins  silverware  or water.   It felt like a worse version of chachos. Look  if you re going to serve this bad  slash those food prices in half. Cant be pricy and make it a bad time.
Taco Flats,4,One of my favorite places for so many reasons  but now especially because I can add pancakes to the list.  One may not think of Taco Flats when they think of breakfast or that pancakes go with queso  and one would be wrong on both accounts.  I m not saying you should dip said stack into your queso  but you know when you just want that satisfying combo of salty and sweet but not necessarily combined  more like a progressive meal that hits both notes  That s what Taco Flats offers  on the weekends at least .  They are currently rocking a  waffles  category on Yelp and while they do not have those  I think it s to lure in brunchers and hopefully brunchers will not be disappointed with the fake out  as their banana walnut pancakes are a beaut of a brunch item.  Their chips still can t be beat  if you like seasoning  and I love their queso.  I will echo a friend and hope they figure out a more sustainable way to serve up their menu when dining in without all the one-time use plastic in the near future 
Taco Flats,5,Okay this place was awesome   I know there are so many taco places in Austin  but I feel like this one is not talked about enough   We came in on a Friday for lunch  and let me tell you this place was packed  Almost every table was filled  and we got the last table available. The inside is super inviting and lively  and the service was spectacular. Our server came to our table multiple times to check on us  and probably refilled our waters 4 times  but always came by when it was approaching being empty    For the tacos  we got the carne asada  pollo asada  and Al pastor. They were all spectacular  I also loved how much protein was in each of the tacos. I m always so disappointed when tacos have a small about of the protein  but taco flats definitely didn t go easy on filling up the tortilla  I think my favorite was the pollo asada just because it was packed with flavors  but again all were awesome.
Taco Flats,6,Not a bad place to get a drink. I tried several ipa samples before getting a beer on tap  The waiter was friendly but this place isn t my vibe. I m tagging along with my son and this is his selection. They brought out queso in a plastic container and I m dining in  who does that  maybe it s a new concept. I m not feeling it.   I m going to drink this beer  pay my ticket and walk out with a smile. I didn t try the tacos and don t know if I have a return visit in me.
Taco Flats,7,That michelada brought me back to life  y all   And I didn t even get mine with beer. Tip  Sub the Mexican beer with Topo Chico or mineral water for the same taste  carbonation  and with better hydration    So glad Katie B introduced me to Taco Flats. We posted up to the bar and ordered a trio to start  salsa  queso  and pico. And to continue nursing the previous night s mistakes  we also ordered agua chile and a stack of pancakes.   The queso  chips  salsa and miche were my favorites  while the aguachile certainly had the flavor and spice  the shrimp in our dish was only butterflied  which made it difficult to eat with chips and plastic utensils. Cutting it fully in half would made it easier to eat.   On that note  They use  a lot  of single-use plastics. Almost everything came in a plastic tupperware dish  plastic utensils  and straws. Not a fan of that. Would love to see that improve in some way.
Taco Flats,8,Great margarita joint  Would definitely recommend getting a frozen with the Chile rim as least to try. Not too sweet or sour  good mix  You can also get it to go for a nominal fee but seems like it would be hard to keep the frozen consistency to-go unless you drank it right away.  The tacos are also pretty darn good too  Only had like 2 diff tacos but their menu is pretty big  would love to come back and try some of their other tacos.   Good location  tucked away some blocks from W 6th. Interesting neighborhood feel 
Taco Flats,9,First time to taco Flats... And I would not recommend this location first of all. I ordered some happy hour queso which was two dollars off. Pretty cool. They handed me rockhard queso and I was able to hold it upside down for longer than five seconds without any of it dripping out.... I m from Houston and I ll let you know I ve never had queso like this...  It was a weird time to stop by considering  all Employees were in between shifts and I was left alone at the bar for 20 mins.. I ll pass next time. Thanks  1 star cause I had put something.
Taco Flats,10,My wife  amp  2 kids  amp  I tried this restaurant for the second time.  The food was pretty decent  but the service  amp  servers were terrible. I had a much better experience a few years ago at the original location. But I cannot recommend this one. We will definitely not be returning ever again.
Taco Flats,11,Our first visit was to Carne Lente in Smithville  only to find out Taco Flats is the birth place of Carne Lente. Lots to offer on the menu....every great meal should start of great queso  and thats exactly what landed was a pick 3....its the best deal....Salsa  Queso and some killer Guacamole.  Wife went with the Chori-Queso and the Carnitas Tacos.....I went the Barbacoa and Birria Taco...everything was banging good....with the Chori-Queso and the Birria being the stars. Service was great and super friendly.
Taco Flats,12,Cozy place  with great decor  and outdoor seating  We really enjoyed the drinks  Moscow macho and the spicy frozen  and the pick 3 appetizer  queso  guac  and salsa roja . My only complaint is the dip appetizer was a lot of food  wish you could get 3 at a smaller portion. We wanted to try all 3 of those dips but it was just way too filling.   We each got 2 tacos  to try multiple different ones  the gringa  birria las beasts  chilango shrimp  fried   and pirata. My favorite hands down was the gringa and my husbands fav was the pirata. I will note that one taco would be plenty if you get an appetizer like we did. So if you only want one taco  GET THE GRINGA  The cheese is melted directly onto the tortilla and omg that brings this traditional taco al pastor to the NEXT level.   Attentive service  almost so much so that I felt rushed. All in all a great experience though and we will be back 
Taco Flats,13,Been hearing about this place from so many friends. Love the space and the food  The Pirata taco and the chips and salsa are must orders.
Taco Flats,14,Queso was very mid and kinda cold  tacos were big  cold and lack flavor but the margarita was decent.
Taco Flats,15,Visited this establishment for the first time last week and loved every bit of it. Drinks were perfect  food was even better. This is a great spot to catch a Happy Hour or to grab lunch and drinks. Patrick was extremely knowledgeable and Simon was awesome as well. Keep up the great work guys. See y all soon.
Taco Flats,16,Chips and queso are great  their drinks are awesome  I got the oaxacan and the spicy margarita  highly recommend both. The chicken quesadilla was okay  the fried cheese on the side adds a nice taste.
Taco Flats,17,My bf and I  came in on Tuesday   during happy hour  and 100  had a pleasant experience. Staff were attentive   and responsive towards our needs.  We each had two cocktails  and you can taste  the hand crafted love going into the drinks. All around  a great experience.  Oh  and the tacos are AMAZING 
Taco Flats,18,Wow they are power tripping at this place  The lady working and male bartender were straight up rude. It was not busy as a all  2 30 on a Wednesday afternoon... we tried to order 2 to go drinks from the bar and were bossed around that we needed to order at the counter. Then when my husband asked if he could have a slightly customized drink he was given a bunch of flack. Not worth the expensive price tag  it was literally  40 for two drinks. It was also odd that the lady put down their Frozen Mescal drink as not very good when that was the entire reason that I came in and what I would consider their premier drink. Although if this is the level of customer service  I will definitely not be returning anytime soon even though I live blocks away. I guess Austin is just not as friendly but as a customer I definitely do not want to be bossed around by someone. If it s completely  uncrowded it should not be a big deal to take my order at the bar and then take my credit card. Why make me stand around and wait around at the counter when I can be comfortable sitting at the bar  SNOOTY  
Taco Flats,19,This place used to be really good  now it s bad service and bad food. The wait staff is bizarrely rude.
Taco Flats,20,I moved to the Clarksville neighborhood in June and have probably been to  or picked up from  Taco Flats eight times since. To start your day  it is a great spot for breakfast  brunch  tacos. Some of their breakfast tacos have cheese toasted onto the tortilla inside which is 10 10. In the afternoons and evening it is the perfect spot for a drink  queso and tacos. I ve tried several and my favorite is chicken mole. After eating chips and queso  one chicken mole is enough to fill me up. My boyfriend s favorites are the Al Pastor and the Carne Asada. Their margaritas are delicious and refreshing.   Also  Wonderful green salsa that goes with anything. My mom took all the leftover salsas home from our table when she joined me.
Taco Flats,21,Came here for dinner with friends and I think this will become my new favorite taco spot. The Pick 3 for dips was such a great deal when coming with a group of friends.  amp  2 Tacos from here are definitely super filling and super packed. I was stuffed by the end of the meal. The wait staff was also super nice  really had amazing recommendations for everyone  amp  I will be coming back for sure
Taco Flats,22,I have been coming here almost a year as I live in the neighborhood. The food and drinks are great but the service lately has sucked. You will wait a while to order and for refills. I sat down for lunch today before going to work with my boyfriend and waited to order for over 10 minutes while the waitress who had only two tables gossiped with another table the entire time  never greeting us. We had our entire order ready to go. We walked out because I couldn t be late to work. I worked as a server for a long time and this is not acceptable to ignore your other tables while talking about trips to Cancun for 10 minutes. There were other workers who saw us sit down and brought water but didn t bother to check if we were ready. I hope this improved as I really liked the place.
Taco Flats,23,The atmosphere is nice  but the tacos are super small and not really better than what you would get at a gas station for a fraction of the price.  Plus they frequently mess up the bill  so closing out is a huge hassle.
Taco Flats,24,For this being 15  meal they really stole my money worth . Everytime I go here everything is wrong  
Taco Flats,25,This place was fine  I liked the makeover from when it was Zocalo  but it was just average.  They now have beer taps.    I had two tacos and the al pastor was better than the chicken adobo.  The chicken was in weird large chunks and sort of tough  so I left some uneaten.  Chips and salsa costs about  3.50  I wish it was included with a minimum  8-10 purchase or a something like that.  The watermelon agua fresca was tasty.    I m on the fence about whether I will return  but I may.
Taco Flats,26,Arrived on a Saturday morning around 1130  patio was open only due to COVID-19. Good set up with a table at the door to order and they were taking safety precautions with workers wearing masks  Service   NEGATIVE 5 stars if I could. My friend ordered two tacos before me. I got mine first and he waited 45 DANG MINUTES for two tacos and it wasnt even busy   The lady working the front table  accidentally  gave away his order to someone else. There are names and phone number for each order  he didnt get a text so I m pretty sure they just didnt make his order   After 30 minutes of waiting my friend checked in with his order and they said they messed up and would make his 2 tacos asap...took another 15 minutes to make the tacos...are there scrubs working in the kitchen    At this point he should have gotten a refund or comped some tacos or drinks   Not only was the service awful  this place was way overpriced for their tacos. Go somewhere else for better tacos 
Taco Flats,27,Visiting my son in Austin. Hands down the best tacos  I have ever eaten  Very fresh  beautiful combination of flavors and so many choices  
Taco Flats,28,My family and I ordered takeout from here over the weekend. The tacos were really tasty and very large.  The mushroom quesadilla was okay-my mushrooms had kind of a weird taste to them. I was disappointed in the queso-it was salty and didn t have much going on  especially considering the  16 price tag. When we placed the order  I didn t realize tip was already included and the person at the counter didn t tell us so I added an additional tip. I don t mind tipping more and I didn t say anything  but I wish they had been less sneaky and more transparent about adding a tip beforehand...
Taco Flats,29,Great place to grab some food or drinks through the week  This place gets super busy on weekends and during happy hour.   Also  counter service only until dinner hours  just show up and go to the left of the entrance to order  seating is cute and good for working.   I am happy to have this place in the neighborhood  Definitely one of my new go to spots 
Taco Flats,30,Taco Flats is absolutely yummy.   A bit pricier then Maudi s but a whole lot better quality.  My favorite is the gringo which features a pork taco  with pickled onions  mango  and yes toasted cheese into the tortilla This technique takes Taco Flats to another dimension.  The chicken flautas combined with queso is a fantastic combo.   I find I do not need to order more then two items to feel satisfied.  Each taco is stuffed to the brim with goodness.   The habanero sauce spicy but oh so good on any of the taco items.     Bye Bye Maudi s Cafe.
Taco Flats,31,The TF Original in the restaurant is awesome. Order for delivery and they don t deliver it the way it is served in the restaurant. The night supervisor was extremely rude and hung up. No personality for the hospitality business too bad avoid the place at all costs
Taco Flats,32,I got delivery of a slightly larger order for my first time trying this place. I don t know why I had bad expectations  but I absolutely love the food. The tacos and the quesadillas are hearty. Greasy  but hangover food kind of greasy. The chips are super flavorful and you can tell they use residue from cooking the meat from the tacos. It s jam-packed full of flavor and it s such a great cheat day meal. My favorite taco was the gringa. Love the sweet acidity of the pineapple. 5 5 
Taco Flats,33,I have only been to this Taco Flats.  We came originally because it was the new neighbor.  We loved the food  the staff and that there is a dog friendly outdoor area.    I really appreciate the extra attention they give to the food.  The chips have a beautiful dusting of chili powder.  The tacos are delicious.  We had the queso for the first time and decided that although very simple  they add flavorful extra touch of peppers and onions.     They also have taken the time to figure out the order of each ingredient that goes into the taco so that it does not all fall apart in a soggy mess. They season the food perfectly.    As for the staff  they are avid fans of the food and have a good appreciation of humor.  It is a fun place to go.
Taco Flats,34,I didn t know this location existed until today  I usually make the trek from East riverside to Burnet. These are my fave tacos  queso  and margs but the chips need a special call out  They are the best chips in the world  My favorite tacos are the Barbcoa  carnitas  and chicken mole. The mole taco is huge and very filling with beans and rice and chicken. I m he carnitas and Barbados are perfectly crisp and greasy and flavorful. My husband loves the gringas taco. The queso is a white with jalape os and chorizo. Overall I love this place. We ordered online using Toast and our tacos were ready in 15 min. Can t wait for the restaurants to open again so we can enjoy the patio.
Taco Flats,35,I love this restaurant  Great Clarksville staple.   I always judge a Mexican restaurant off of their chips salsa and their margs.   Taco flats salsas are absolutely amazing and freshly made. And their margaritas are AUTHENTIC and made with REAL ingredients. None of the sugary syrup.      Most important thing to note on this place    Even though its called Taco flats  the QUESADILLAS are where its AT.   They should be called Quesadilla Flats. Because the quesadillas come with a crispy cheese border crust.   Literally  they serve this thing in a pizza box  because that s how big the cheese crust is.   BEST quesadilla in Austin and probably best you ll ever have.   A MUST order.
Taco Flats,36,Love this place. Has everything you want at a taco joint  and the baria taco is my favorite crunchy taco in Austin. Good menu and good drinks. Must give it a try.
Taco Flats,37,Really good tacos. However if you have a food allergy they can t be trusted. I told the waiter quite clearly and he nodded when I told him about  my gluten allergy but seemed quite laissez faire about it. There was some confusion about a corn or flour taco at some point. Sure enough I was sick all night. Because somewhere along the way they served me gluten. Not a fan. I don t like going somewhere that clearly isn t concerned with making customers sick or respecting allergies.
Taco Flats,38,Great food  drinks  and service. High quality cocktails and food at a reasonable price is increasingly hard to find in Austin but this place hits the mark in all areas. Love hanging out on the patio too. Highly recommended 
Taco Flats,39,The chilaquiles breakfast tacos are incredible  Lots of other vegetarian options. Very friendly staff too  Happy to have a new favorite spot in Clarksville.
Taco Flats,40,Simon and his crew have done it again    I love the vibe of the new place. What an upgrade from Zocalo   And you won t find a better deal in town than the pollo asado taco.  So much deliciousness for so little dinero.  It s freaking bananas.   Layer in the fact that the owner has a genuine passion for what he does  as evidenced by him constantly grinding at one of his locations  and you have an Austin success story.    The ghost of the old West Lynn Cafe  an Austin institution at that location back in the 90s  can rest comfortably now.  Viva Taco Flats 
Taco Flats,41,Made it to Taco Flats Clarksville for the first time and it was a delight  If you re familiar with the Burnet location you ll find the same delicious food and beverages but the whole experience at this new location is outshining the OG location for sure. The decor is so so cute with comfortable seating. Still a good amount of TVs for watching all the sports. Our waitress was super attentive which was appreciated  sometimes I feel the other location had no wait staff at all   Or we were putting them out      Anywho  even tho burnet is closer to my house. I will be making it to this location more often. So friendly and inviting.  And the tacos chips agave old fashioneds are the bomb   definitely add it to your list 
Taco Flats,42,Clarksville finally has its neighborhood bar. A great bite to eat  a delicious cocktail  a tasty beer  they offer it all and they do it right.   Still fairly new their model has changed a bit  full service inside and counter service outside.   Pescadito and the Pirata tacos are the stand out  lots of good shareable options as well.
Taco Flats,43,This place is awesome. Baffled by the negative reviews and I feel compelled to support this small NEW business. Maybe there were new business speed bumps  Anyway  they sure seem to have been resolved.   If you re like me  just a patron that goes to restaurants to enjoy the food  not a food critic hobbyist  you will love the food and you ll love the margs  they are unique and amazing  I spoke with a wait person and they told me about how they make everything  how they source their fresh fish  how the owners take trips to Mexico City to get inspired for what to bring back and deliver the real mescal margaritas and street taco flavors.  I had the carnitas  some awesome fish taco  a beef taco  chips and guacamole.  I thought the restaurant was a clean establishment  not a food spot that I could see  not a sticky spot on my table  my menu was clean.  As for service  I had 3 different wait staff check in on me  pleasant  genuine.   Food was timely and delicious. The flavors all came through  nothing overpowered  on my tacos I tasted the avocado  the onion  the fresh cilantro  the cheese  and the meat  with just the right amount of salt and heat  was delicious.  I am the kind of majority customer that goes in there. I was sitting around a whole bunch of me s. Customers  near me were commenting about the amazing food  the tequila  ordering 3 tacos each  ordering take out  etc. All tables and the bar were full the week nights that I was there. Nice vibe.
Taco Flats,44,Glad to see this hot spot in Clarksville revived  I ll definitely miss the drink specials from Zocalo s but the tacos from Taco Flats are AMAZING   This prime location is perfect for sitting on the patio and people watching.
Taco Flats,45,The tacos are good  but sadly service and cleanliness don t seem to be a priority. We have been getting the breakfast tacos from the truck they had out front during constructions  and were really excited for the place to open up  but I m pretty disappointed in my first experience.   For brunch  lunch they have adopted the Hop Doddy method of order at the register  pay and tip  20  for your yet to be received service  then find a seat. Unfortunately unlike Hop Doddy who does an amazing job with service  Taco Flats is severely lacking. They barely give you any service at all once you sit. In fact  until someone brought our 3 tacos and waffle out  20 minutes later   no one said a word to us. We actually had to stop the person who gave us our food from leaving to ask for flatware for the waffle  and it s actually plasticware so not super environmentally friendly   and we had to get plastic cups for water to drink too.    They also don t seem to care about cleanliness at all. We went for brunch on Saturday  10.18  around 11am  there were a couple of people at the bar  and 3 tables were occupied  so not super busy. The place was a mess  every free table was dirty  as was the floor. The food took a good while to come out  so I had a lot of time to observe the staff. They all seemed board and not at all motivated to take care of the place. One ...server  came out several times  would pick up a couple of dirty dishes  then wander to the back for several minutes before coming out. I worked for years at a  still  very successful downtown restaurant  and it kills me to see this happening when I know how much a little effort would go to really make this place amazing.   I had high hopes for Taco Flats replacing Zocalo because I wanted something in the hood that I could walk to when I didn t want to cook or drive  but unfortunately Taco Flats is running mediocre fast food style service  with high end restaurant prices. There are so many good options in Austin that they are going to have to step it up if they want to be successful. I may go again in a month  and I will happily update my review if possible  because I m hoping this is something they fix 
Taco Flats,46,I can t express how good the tacos are at Taco Flats.  The service has to improve  We went last night. We were seated  which is different from when they first opened  you ordered first then sat down on your own . We were seated next to a family. Shortly thereafter two people sat on the other side of us. The server first went to the table of the people that were sat last. For whatever reason that took a while. Instead of going to the table of the family and or us  the server went to the kitchen. I guess the family had been there a while  because they all left at that point.  We waited a while. A server came by and asked if everything is okay. I told him that we want to order. He gave us a thumbs up then went behind the bar. Strange.  We order a pick three which came out pretty quick and was better than the last time we ordered it. My wife ordered a taco and I ordered caldo de pollo. It was a little bit of a wait before she got her taco. They told me my soup will be right out. Unless they make soup a bowl at a time I found it odd that they couldn t give me my soup then too. Wife waited for my order  but I told here to eat. She stopped about half way through because I still did not have my soup. I told her to finish because I was ready to leave.   No caldo for me  I asked for the check when my wife finished her meal. I had to tell the server to take the caldo off because I did not get it. She said she was sorry and gave us 15  off. Ummmm. Okay.  This is not the only time the service is not been good. But they recently opened and I know it takes time to work through things. We think we will let them work through things with other people before we go back.  Again  the tacos are great  Otherwise I would only give it one star.
Taco Flats,47,Not your typical Tex-Max. I got quesadilla and queso chips and they were extremely oily and didn t have any veggies at all aside from some garnish. Tasted ok  but disappointed and I likely won t be ordering from them again when there s so many other amazing Tex mex food and authentic Mexican food in town.
Taco Flats,48,Taco Flats was recommended to me by a friend who is really really hard to please  and he loved it. It s now my top casual place to eat. The tacos are delicious with elevated flavors  but not trying so hard the main ingredient gets lost. Service is fast and attentive. If you haven t been  I suggest giving them a try 
Taco Flats,49,I used to enjoy this place and I have previously posted good reviews. This time was different. I own a few bars and what I want from my employees is to supply good customer service to our customers so they come back. The law has always stated that an individual who has a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask are exempt from the law. I have an alternative style mask especially for my condition. The servers thought it was appropriate to be rude in this situation while telling me I can t order. I understand NOW that your policy goes beyond state and city law and discriminates against people with certain medical conditions. It would have been easier if you just stated it on your webpage. I was over 6 ft away so the reaction by someone who is supposed to give customer service to me was hilarious. They won t get any more of my money
Taco Flats,50,Taco flats is always good. Amazing service  incredible food and great cocktails  I love the new location and honestly dream about the chips and queso
Taco Flats,51,Not gonna lie this is some of my favorite Mexican food I ve had in a while. Boyfriend and I shared the queso and I got the Chicken Mole taco and the Grilled Panela taco. Everything  was tasty. I actually really like their queso... and I  don t usually like queso. Tacos were good too. They have a good happy hour.
Taco Flats,52,Two  2  hours after I placed an online order  the food was ready to be picked up. This is after their online ordering system  Toast said it would be ready in  0-5 minutes .
Taco Flats,53,Trying to support local - third time my order is wrong - they keep adding on 10  for a service charge on top of the tax and tip. Just a tad under  40.00 for 2 tacos and 2 ice tea. The meat they use looks ok - for this kind of money they should be able to get the order right. lost my business today - was a loyal weekly customer. The wait staff was like well it is what it is.
Taco Flats,54,I m a chip guy. salty chip guy. No salsa just salty chips. I thought Pappasitos had best chips but I think I just found the best chip. I ran in on a whim. Ordered queso which I couldn t believe was  10. I also got x2 mole tacos to go. I m a mole freak from my time living in Mexico City. Like I love mole. I thought it was strange when I picked up order and I asked for salt package cuz I couldn t wait to get to my car and eat a salty chip on way home. She apologizes and said they had none. Then I looked around for a salt shaker on tables and along the bar. There wasn t one to be seen. Omg then I ate a chip on way out. It was and needed no salt. This have never happened. This is on another level chip. They are brownish like almost burnt looking. I was so excited to try the mole tacos that made an ordeal. They were too good for microwave so I heated up the already warm tacos in oven while I ate the totally underwhelming queso and then the worst mole I ve ever had. Threw my second mole taco away. bland mole wanted by NOBODY EVER. Literally disgusting. I wanted to diversify upon ordering but nobody serves mole in Austin so I couldn t. this place has potential. nice staff and atmosphere. Gross mole taco
Taco Flats,55,One of our favorite places to go for a easy and delicious meal. This continues to be a favorite takeout spot even during quarantine. We love their spicy frozen margaritas  The best tacos too. Their food is always incredible and tastes just as good at home as it does in the restaurant. Would highly recommend this spot if you haven t tried it 
Taco Flats,56,Great food. Killer drinks. Amazingly friendly people working. My new favorite spot for sure.
Taco Flats,57,This place is horrible  I called in an order for 3 veggie tacos to go. When I got home there was only 1 small slice of avocado on one taco and the other tacos just had spinach and refried black beans. I called to ask for a refund and the guy basically accused me of lying  He said he checked the tacos himself and he was pretty certain there was avocado. And then said  there is no way for him to tell if there even aren t any on them.  I told him that I wouldn t call just to lie about a couple slices of avocado. So he said  I guess I can refund you for two tacos.  He sounded so put out by it. And I didn t even get a credit back to my card. Not like  6 is a big deal...it s the fact that he pretty much accused me of lying  So RUDE   And the tacos were bad without the avocado. Just raw spinach and bland refried beans.  This was my first time going to Taco Flats and I will not go back. Zocalo was a hundred times better than this place 
Taco Flats,58,Finally  A great casual dining spot in west Austin  Tacos are great  guac is even better. Try a Pirata taco and you won t be disappointed.
Taco Flats,59,I was excited to have Taco Flats open in the neighborhood  but unfortunately  I don t think it s a keeper. The newly redone space has a bar vibe - mostly high cocktail tables  jammed together  along with a very tight bar space  we watched several people struggle to get on the stools because they are so jammed together . That would be fine and could be overlooked but the food was only average. There wasn t anything bad about it  but it wasn t great either  both my husband and I felt it was very salty . The previous tenant had better and fresher choices. I left my cocktail 75  undrunk - it just wasn t that good either. Probably won t be back.
Taco Flats,60,Best tacos in town  Margs are amazing as well. Cannot recommend the taco Al Pastor enough....So very good.
Taco Flats,61,I LOVE the new TacoFlats location  I ve frequented the burnet location many times in the past and always enjoyed their tacos. My usual favorites are the PESCADITO taco and the PANCHOS. Don t sleep on those panchos. They use their house made tostada chips and then throw on a bunch of delicious toppings. The staff here at the West Lynn location was very attentive and polite when helping me and my friend today. Our bartender  Alex  made me a delicious agave old fashioned which was to die for. Anyone who enjoys tequila with a little smoke will be pleasantly surprised at this old fashioned adaptation.   Looking forward to my next visit. Fun atmosphere for friends and food.
Taco Flats,62,Solid place  I had 2 tacos and was expecting skimpy street tacos but boy was I mistaken  Nice chunks of carnitas. I recommend the gringa taco  it has melted cheese on the tortilla w chunks of juicy pork  Pineapple  cilantro  onion and that jalape o sauce they give you. It s amazing  The staff is cool aff too. Good local beer selection
Taco Flats,63,So after trying out this menu a few times I ve found the right order. A few of my favorite tacos include the Pescadito  El Ni o  Panela  Chori Queso with mushrooms. The Pick three with guacamole  queso  and black beans  while a little pricey is actually quite good and worth it. I still mourn the loss of the Muy Loco Wednesday happy hours that used to be had at this location under the former restaurant occupant  but the food is actually on par if not a little better.
Taco Flats,64,This place is amazing. The interior is beautiful  but cozy. The service was great. The food came out super fast and the server was very friendly. I got two breakfast tacos  the Migas and the black amp green. The Migas was probably one of the best ones I ve ever had. I also definitely didn t need two tacos because they were stuffed so full  that I was full after the first one  Ask for the habanero hot sauce  it s garlicy with just the right amount of heat. The price for quality and size was also amazing.
Taco Flats,65,VEGAN VEGETARIAN WARNING    the flour tortillas are made with LARD. Very frustrating as no one pointed that out the first few times visiting even when purposely ordering for food restrictions.
Taco Flats,66,To-go is a disaster over there. Check your orders before you leave. When I called out there mistake they didn t really care.
Taco Flats,67,Service was great  food was good. Can t really complain. We went on a Sunday night and it stayed pretty busy the whole time we were there. Not all of the food we got was  amazing  but it was all fairly good. I recommend the hippie taco and chilango shrimp taco. The chips and queso is also great. If you like spicy  def try the habanero sauce 
Taco Flats,68,Good food  terrible service. I ve been twice - the first time I was the only person there on a Tuesday morning and it took 40 minutes for me to get my tacos because the kitchen didn t see my order. The second time I went  during covid . The hostess who greeted us had  by far  the worst attitude I ve ever experienced at a restaurant. She rushed us to order then continued to give us dirty looks while we waited for our order. I d also like to point out that they had at least 4 people outside of the kitchen working - the tables outside were wet from a storm the night before but no one was wiping them down. The staff was just hanging out inside while customers were trying to dry off wet tables to have a place to sit. The food at Taco Flats is good  I prefer breakfast   however  the service doesn t make it worth going to.
Taco Flats,69,The new Taco Flats  Clarksville  is beautifully redone and the new frozen they have is delicious. My favorite tacos are the pirata and the chilango shrimp  both will not disappoint. The staff is friendly and appears to work hard. We were there during a very busy time and none of the staff stopped moving the entire time. A little chaos is to be expected in a new restaurant. We had a great time and will be back again.
Taco Flats,70,Amazing tacos and fabulous drinks  The tortillas are fresh and handmade.  Guacamole can be sized down to a small which is a nice option.  Way better than Zocalo  We ll be back 
Taco Flats,71,Seriously some of the best Tacos I ve had in Austin and I ve lived here 5 years. The Gringa is exceptional.
Taco Flats,72,This place was so amazing we went 3 times in the span of 5 days.  My fave tacos are the chilango shrimp  the carnitas  and the chori-queso.  The cheese dip was great too. One of the servers we had was super awesome but another was not  so they may still be working out the kinks  but overall a great experience and DELICIOUS food   
Taco Flats,73,Ran in for a taco to go. 26 minutes after ordering  I inquired. It was sitting in the window. But hey  the staff was enjoying each other s company  so I guess it wasn t a complete waste of time. I ll add a star since the food is good.  Service.....well......
Taco Flats,74,Food was ok  but cold because they couldn t find us in a half empty restaurant      and it took forever. Also they were out of ceviche at 5pm. We live super close  but I d really rather get on my bike and go to a more reliable place. Also - they spent forever redoing the restaurant inside and it s essentially the same. We need some great places in the neighborhood. At least we still have Galaxy.
Taco Flats,75,Man I sure hope they get it together as this neighborhood would love a quality Tex-mex place. So far we are 0-3 so going to wait a few more months in hopes they figure out how to run things and get the food quality up. Wishing them well.
Taco Flats,76,Second time and last - bad service both times. Coincidence  Maybe. More likely the problem runs deeper. My 2 cents - if you sell expensive tacos and drinks  make sure to provide good service.
Taco Flats,77,Some of the best BIG breakfast tacos I ve had in Austin. Friendly people too    So glad y all are in the neighborhood now.
Quezzas,1,Quezzas is comfort food and flavor to the max   A few months ago  my husband  friend and I visited Quezza s Austin off Barton Springs Road and South Lamar. This Austin food truck is brand new  It s only been around for a few weeks but has already accrued a loyal customer base. And it s no wonder really  their quesadilla based  modern. Mexican pizzas are unbelievably delicious.  I wrote a whole lot more about Quezzas in my post below   a href   redir url https 3A 2F 2Fthehonestshruth.com 2Fquezzas-austin-home-to-the-quesadilla-pizzas-you-didnt-know-you-needed 2F amp s 68e14730c3280e3f8fa16b407d5aad4a9547ecdaaaa21d18c88568d2a40d3913  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  thehonestshruth.com quez   a   Cheers  Shruthi
Quezzas,2,At Quezzas  they keep their menu simple  either you can order a quesadilla or Mexican pizza.   I was super excited when I saw Quezzas served Mexican Pizzas  but was disappointed when I saw ground beef was not an option. No worries  I can divert and be bold by trying something different. However  even with an open mind  Quezzas just did not hit my craving as much as I thought it could. It tasted like something you could easily make on a griddle. Essentially  you are paying for labor at Quezzas and not something actually gourmet.
Quezzas,3,A  200.00 tip was added to my card without my consent  on a  14.00 order  here. Swipe your own card and make sure you get a receipt  Also  be sure to run through all of the options on the tablet and don t leave the tip option up. I m all for tipping  but an almost 1400  tip wasn t in the cards for that night.  I ll follow up with some positive - the food was great - that wasn t the issue. I had initially reached out to both my credit card company and the owners of Quezzas at the same time. American Express ultimately decided that they considered it was a valid charge  because I informed them that I was indeed making a purchase at the time. They care about the swipe  not what comes after. If you don t slide the card yourself and add your own tip  or decline to   anything can be added and you ll be liable.  One of the owners of Quezzas DID respond to me very quickly  and let me know that he would investigate and refund - great  He was also very professional cordial willing to help  but ultimately did not rectify the situation  even after saying they would  and after three months of back and forth via email. He initially said that because I disputed with AMEX  that he had to provide documentation to Square  the payment processor  and go through a waiting period before being able to refund me. That s fair  but we re way past any waiting period. He also said that his payment processor is telling him it was refunded  but I confirmed with American Express that it was not  as an extra step  because I knew for a fact I did not get a refund on any of my statements since the incident .  I gave them more than enough opportunity to rectify this situation  but unfortunately at this point the only thing I can do is write this review and hope to prevent others from experiencing the same thing.  I ve written off the money at this point  but I want to be sure that people are aware when eating here. As of today  I m getting a bounce back when I follow up via email. Not sure if they re having email server issues or if I was blocked.
Quezzas,4,AWFUL  Rude and the food was cold and nasty. Ordered 2 pizzas that were missing ingredients and like I said  super cold 
Quezzas,5,Rainey street with multiple food truck. We tried pizza quesadilla interesting concept it s light and airy I wished we would have gotten pepperoni instead. The picture looked much better but this was the chicken with black bean  none was available  green onion  also not on there not sure why and chipotle sauce. It was basically chicken and cheese. That s why we wished we would went with pepperoni instead. Still it was good will try a diff one and it did cost  15 a bit pricey.
Quezzas,6,What a cool concept and friendly people behind it. My mom particularly enjoyed how flavorful the quezza is and also how well baked it is. Amazing rainy day or drink night food option.
Quezzas,7,These quesadilla pizzas are fairly good. The margarita one was not bad. I think I was expecting maybe more tomato sauce and cheese so it would be more similar to a pizza that s stuffed with additional cheese.
Quezzas,8,Had the pico de Gallo and Hot sauce drizzle  you have to get this  and it was phenomenal. Vegetarian friends loved it too. Made me not miss the Mexican Pizza from Taco Bell. The pollo is good too
Quezzas,9,Incredibly delicious and fresh   The team working was delightfully welcoming and created an amazing experience for us to enjoy.
Quezzas,10,The food is always amazing and so tasty. We often crave this place  the problem is consistently with hours and location. They have moved around a lot and sometimes aren t open when they say they are. The phone number listed here  you can t get anyone to answer and the voicemail still says they are at Barton Saloon but they haven t been there in almost a year. I ve gone a couple times during the hours listed to find them closed. Still love it and will keep supporting the business. It s Covid times so not to surprised with any place being inconsistent. At least when they are open you know it s always going to be good.
Quezzas,11,One of my favorite food trucks  no doubt  The food is unique and delicious  the service and staff are wonderful  and the location is perfect  shout out to Hi-Sign Brewing . Oh and make sure to try the dip trio   Can t wait to go back   
Quezzas,12,We ve gotten pizzas here twice and really like them.  Both times we ordered the Margarita   12  and the Lone Star to go   13  - delicious  if a little pricey for the size.  They tell customers that a pizza serves one person  but we can never eat both at the same meal.  But pizza makes good leftovers  of course  and it s nice to get two meals out of two smallish pizzas. They remind me of the wonderful  tlayudas  I had in Oaxaca  Mexico  a number of years ago.   They could be more generous with the brisket on the Lone Star  but that s our only complaint.  Owner  or manager   Bob is a great guy  very accommodating and friendly and both times provided us with generous amounts of their sauces.  We keep meaning to go back with our pups and eat at the picnic tables provided by the bar adjacent to Quezza s  which is in their parking lot.  Can t remember the name of the bar  though.  We ll go if the temperature ever goes below 80 degrees - maybe in January 
Quezzas,13,I live in Austin and come to this park regularly. They take your order. Give it to others. And then yell horrible female explicit words and have you cal your credit card company to reverse a charge when they mess up. The man literally yelled horrible things against women.
Quezzas,14,So good  We have come here 4 or 5 times now and it s delicious every time. Their chips  they use Julio s  and salsa is awesome and I love that they have a vegan option with soyrizo  I get it every time we come and bf who isn t vegan likes it as well . Pizza and quesadilla combo  Genius.
Quezzas,15,I work at the WeWork up Barton springs  cruised down for a quick lunch and it was perfect  Food came out fast and they were very helpful in helping me choose what to order. Pacifico pizza with garlic dipping sauce
Quezzas,16,This place is boooomb. Super original idea and unbelievably delicious. Run  don t walk to Quezzas  And the owners are pretty awesome  too.
Quezzas,17,Found this place thanks to UberEats and it s safe to say I am now obsessed. Thin crust pizza loaded with flavor. Some margarita pizzas can be bland and in my opinion a hit or miss  so I was hesitant to order theirs...HOWEVER  the margarita pizza at Quezzas is the best I ve ever had. Their vegan pizza is bomb as well. Ya won t be disappointed
Quezzas,18,Been here a few times now  different and delicious  The Pacifico is a treat. They have a vegan Quezza which my yonc  loves. The guy with the 1 star review is wrong. Friendly staff  tasty salsa  and good brews at BSS  high recommend.
Quezzas,19,New exciting food truck on Barton Springs at the Barton Springs Saloon. Very friendly staff that delivers your Quezza to you. The food is very quick and AMAZE. The Pacifico is LEGIT and so is the Quezzo. Will become regulars 
Quezzas,20,This place is an unexpected and most welcome gem. Perfect late night food and exactly what I was looking for  Ps side of queso for a dollar- cheers 
Quezzas,21,I ve sampled almost every food truck in Austin  right now April 2019 - this is my favorite one of them all. Yes that Pizza joint behind Buford s is good  so are the trucks on the east side. And I do think this place is slightly overpriced for the Taco Bell Mexican Pizza on steroids. BUT the fact is  you can t go get anything like it anywhere else. Which can t be said for very many of the trucks around here anymore.
Quezzas,22,This is a very good pizza  warm staff  something nice of you are hungry at late night.
Quezzas,23,Don t know how this place has good reviews  I had a salad with chicken it was  14 and it was disgusting. Do not come here  Worst food I had in a while.
Quezzas,24,Man the lady bird didn t owe me anything. Amazing. The crust is divine and crispy to perfection.
Quezzas,25,Staff is amazing. The prices are unbelievably great for the quality and all the ingredients on your pizza the environment is perfect and you can also enjoy a great beer from HiSign. Overall it s a great concept and you won t be disappointed.
Quezzas,26,This place is incredible. I ve eaten at a lot of food trucks and what they re doing is inventive  tasty and fast.  I ve only been here once and I m already addicted.
Quezzas,27,If you haven t tried a modern Mexican pizza at Quezzas  you should. Cool concept  kind of a cross between a pizza and a quesadilla. Lots of great flavor choices. We had a Lone Star  brisket  and a Lady Bird  chicken . Both delicious. Highly recommend. Get a quezza and have a beer at the Saloon next door.
Quezzas,28,Simply put  these QUEZZAS are amazing  The flavor combinations make me want to try each one  but so far Lonestar is my favorite   And that jalapeno dipping sauce  I could OD on...just sayin . This is a great location and friendly staff. Definitely will be back often 
Quezzas,29,If you could create a Mexican pizza that you re not embarrassed to order as an adult with a  refined  palate  this would be it. Exceptional  and considering how many food trucks are in the area  that s a big statement.
Quezzas,30,Went with several friends to try these Modern Mexican Pizzas....WOW  I was impressed  had no idea my mouth would be so happy.  We ordered chips and Quezzo which was fabulous....then we proceeded to the main menu....ordered 4 pizzas  Pacifico  Margarita  Lone Star and the Lady bird....hard to say which was the best  but I think the Pacifico inched ahead just a little.  I don t recall the names of the dipping sauces  but each one was better than the last   I you want something different that is purely delicious...you have got to try this place.  I need to add that the chef and his assistant were very friendly and helpful  
Quezzas,31,Amazing food.  The Pacifico was awesome loved the sweet and spicy flavors   These guys are doing it right with their food and overall vibe   Keep it up 
Quezzas,32,So good  And the lady working tonight was so nice. Yummmmm quesadilla pizza  Margerita  pizza  was fantastic 
Quezzas,33,We catered with Quezzas for a group of 40  people. The food was excellent  the delivery was right on time  amp  the service was great  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone interested in catering an event.
Quezzas,34,Excellent service  pizza was great  I had the brisket pizza. I ordered it late  and they still came and delivered despite being last the deadline. Very nice people.
Quezzas,35,Best queso I ve ever had  Highly recommend the lady bird quezza too. This truck is the perfect pairing with Barton Springs Saloon
Taqueria La Escondida,1,The convenience of getting food while waiting to get a tire looked at  My son wanted AC and food  I just wanted to wait somewhere that s not a waiting area. I saw the sign and we headed there without delay. There was a party of 12 and us. It was cold. The waitress was quite happy to see us and made suggestions. The menu was detailed with pictures. The ice tea was strong and the lemonade was fresh. The chicken fajita taco salad was excellent-even the tortilla bowl was crisp and tasty. All was timely and good. The place is not too big and they have booth type seating along with tables. The waitress said they get busy in the evenings. I d go back more hungry next time  
Taqueria La Escondida,2,Mini Tacos Pastor  World Class tacos  The salsa verde is spicy and unique. Highly recommended 
Taqueria La Escondida,3,The no-frills interior feels very small-town -- not unlike much of South Austin was many years back  like 1980 s way-back . The appeal of this place is the food  for sure. A local place to support and love right across from Discount Tire  where also I recommend you tend to all your tire needs  . I usually go for the chicken enchiladas  but my family has ordered all kinds of things. The only thing that has been a let-down was once when a side of rice came out barely warm--usually things are just right. But beware  the salsas vary from spicy to very spicy   P.S. Bonus - they have a drive thru  Works best if you call ahead and pick it up -- always fast if you call ahead 
Taqueria La Escondida,4,Groovy little dive Mexican restaurant that has been a staple on the south side for many years. Conveniently located between 1st and Congress on Ben White. Easy little spot to stop into if you re waiting on your tires at Discount.   My favorite is the enchiladas and the torta cubana.   Always a nice authentic vibe jazzy Mexican music playing in the background.   Don t let the bars on the windows... This place is legit
Taqueria La Escondida,5,Located next to Discount Tire on the 290 east frontage road. It s cheaper to pay in cash than use a credit card.  I saved about 55 cents on a  13 dinner.   The tamarind agua fresca was delicious and cost only  2. You can get a single gluten free al pastor taco for only  2 in a brick and mortar  That s almost as cheap as what I used to pay for a taco in Rosarito  Mexico twenty three years ago  I made the mistake of ordering three crispy tacos in a platter instead of a single due to the language barrier.
Taqueria La Escondida,6,Good food and a friendly staff that abided by COVID protocols to make sure everyone felt safe. Got the chicken quesadilla and while it might seem like a boring order... it was very good  Will be coming back 
Taqueria La Escondida,7,We saw this coming back from the airport and it was so good    I had the street tacos pastor. We got there around 2 in the afternoon and this place is popping   Fast service and the salsa was homemade and had a nice kick to it   It s one of those hole in the walls that you never forget 
Taqueria La Escondida,8,I love supporting local However this location has really let me down. we wait an hour for our order -  we were the only ones in the drive thru . Not once did the young lady who took our order come to the window to let us know the Status of our order. I couldn t cancel my order since I had already paid for it. Once she came to the window I casually mentioned wow that was an hour   she said  yea I know  And that was it. When I got home with our order 3 of the 5 containers had hair inside   with the food  the tacos were touching the hair     Beyond disappointed and disgusted. Hoping this was an off day for them but we will NOT be returning.
Taqueria La Escondida,9,A group of friends and I went for breakfast before heading out of town and it was okay. I thought it would be a little better seeing the amount of stars the business had. I ordered barbacoa tacos and they lacked favor. Everyone else ordered a fajita burrito  chicken enchiladas  and chilaquiles and they also said it was okay. Service wise we sat down and waited 15 minutes if not longer until I had to get a server to take our drinks. After then the service was better. Not sure about going back next time I am in town.
Taqueria La Escondida,10,Service was fast and the food was good...I had a heads up to do tacos or Fajita beef quesadillas..The tortillas were homemade and the pricing was fairly decent..
Taqueria La Escondida,11,This is definitely my go to place for al pastor tacos. Their mini al pastor tacos are delicious  especially with their spicy red salsa. Definitely recommend 
Taqueria La Escondida,12,Working Mans lunch plates  Kinda load reminds me of a Catina lots of laughs and talk lots of food for the price.
Taqueria La Escondida,13,Currently my go to spot for the best cheap authentic tacos in the city  So delicious   To me its so important and nice to have found a sit down taco joint. Taco trucks are terrible in Austin and usually aren t worth the money and lack of service  facilities. This place is the answer
Taqueria La Escondida,14,NASTY NASTY NASTY    DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT FOOD POISONING. so so dirty. Terrible service and policies. I will never go back and will continue to urge people to spend their money elsewhere. Hell. Taco Cabana is way better and CLEANER than this place. Beware.
Taqueria La Escondida,15,Customer service sucks    On their menu  it says 3 tacos for  3.50 which is what I ordered  my total was  4.87. When I asked why the big jump  the lady very rudely said   no mix   wth is no mix   and turned around and continued her business. Well I guess her tip will pay for the difference. Also  been waiting for almost 15 minutes     First and last time here   Not recommending this place 
Taqueria La Escondida,16,Not the prettiest in the outside... but had great service for dinner. Excellent bistec  beef  street tacos  Will definitely be coming back to get these- they were perfectly cooked and came with cilantro  queso fresco and some  grilled onions and even a grilled jalape o  Yum  Make sure you get a Mexican coke to wash it down. I also ordered the quest which was good.
Taqueria La Escondida,17,I had the mini street tacos and pozola. The poloza was spicy and delicious. Good horchata and melon drinks too.
Taqueria La Escondida,18,This is a Big Al kind of place   Not trendy  no hipsters.  Good quality food  cheap prices  Xlnt service.  Had the Migas Rancheros  migas with chorizo in a ranchero sauce .  Got so much had to take a to-go box.    Really good coffee.   Interesting note-they put a cinnamon stick in the coffee pot.  they don t use too much  gives the coffee a nice taste.
Taqueria La Escondida,19,I stopped in because it was close to the mechanic and I m glad I did.  The staff was friendly  the location convenient  for me   and the queso delicious 
Taqueria La Escondida,20,I had ordered the Chicken breast Mexican style but they brought out the Pechuga Asada  I still ate it. The grilled chicken breast was quite tasty and I devoured all of it  The dish comes with french fries too and I m super glad it did because I didn t care for the beans nor the rice. The rice was a yellow color and tasted a little off and the beans were on the bland side. The salsa and chips were terrific.   I ll be back to give breakfast a shot.
Taqueria La Escondida,21,Pretty solid Jalisco style mexican food. Expect just ok service if you don t habla espanol. Good breakfast plates  fresh salsa not too spicy  just how I like it. Hot food  good prices  ok service  standard taqueria atmosphere. I wouldn t bring my friends here  and I probably wouldn t go back based on what I ve had  but might be interested in going and trying something else off the menu.
Taqueria La Escondida,22,Probably one the best places I ve been in a while. Location seems tricky but really isn t. If you spend by it you ll miss it and it s on you because there s enough time to see it and parking isn t an issue. The food id amazing. Flavorful and almost addictive. Definitely coming back. Nice staff  and great price for the quality of food served. It isn t flashy or fancy and that s why I love it.
Taqueria La Escondida,23,Good food  moderately priced  salsa was mild but flavorful.  Good quality ingredients  quick polite service  clean eating area even though I was at the tail end of the lunch crowd.  Will go back to try more from their menu.
Taqueria La Escondida,24,Had the al pastor burrito while waiting for my car next door to finish. It was a very pleasant way to spend lunch even by myself. The burrito was very yummy and the price tag is great too 
Taqueria La Escondida,25,Omg I love this place.from day one. I brought my husband and kids and I always recommend it to my family and friends.their prices have gone up a little but it s worth it my always have a chorizo and egg torta.the coffee is off the best.the service is good too but the food is better
Taqueria La Escondida,26,Well  it s March 2013  and I m still eating regularly at Taqueria la Escondida  at least once a week  usually more. Still great value for the money  Tasty food  big portions  low prices.  If you re taking a date out  especially a  first date    you might wanna pick a place with classier decor. But if you DO  do enough research to make sure that place is gonna have good food. I ve spent LOTS more money and gotten lower quality food in the Mexican category.  I m gonna upgrade my rating to 5 Stars. Like my original review says  I base reviews on what a place it TRYING TO BE. And in the dingy  no-decor category of Taquerias  this place has the MOST IMPORTANT element. DOWN-HOME GOOD FOOD.  Yep  I still recommend Taqueria la Escondida.  PLEASE CLICK ON LINK BELOW TO READ MY ORIGINAL REVIEW  IT IS HIDDEN   larrythediner
Taqueria La Escondida,27,My friendly neighborhood taqueria.  Good  cheap and reliable northern Mexican food.  Excellent choice for breakfast and lunch if you re in the area.  They have WIFI and accept credit cards.
Taqueria La Escondida,28,Good food  affordable  where do you see that much anymore  especially with the new restaurants  in Austin these days. Service is consistently good. Drive Through available.
Taqueria La Escondida,29,Oh their fries in the shrimp chipotle plate is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Glad I asked for the Chipotle sauce to be on the side and not on the grilled shrimps cause that sauce is too spicy for me.  Those shrimps are good.
Taqueria La Escondida,30,My local breakfast taco favorite. The bacon is crispy and potatoes are seasoned. The waitresses are always friendly and put up with my lousy Spanish.
Taqueria La Escondida,31,This is a dive Mexican eatery so don t be fooled. The interior is very basic with realy no decorations or anything like that to jazz it up. With that said  the food is very good. I have been here a dozen or so times for breakfast or lunch and the food is cooked to order and tastes fresh.   My favorite thing is the food is very very inexpensive for what you get. Three breakfast tacos for 2.99 is ridiculously cheap and you can mix and match what you want in them. The breakfast plates are also well priced at 3.99 - 5.99 and will definitely fill you up. I personally like huevos rancheros the best.  THE BREAKDOWN  - dining room is not fancy and very basic - food is fantastic - people are very nice - food prices are very inexpensive for what you get.
Taqueria La Escondida,32,The staff was friendly and quick which is why they are not getting one star. I ordered the enchiladas. The beans were cold and the enchiladas were not tasty and not very filling.
Taqueria La Escondida,33,Currently I am a fan of La escondida for breakfast which they serve all day.  The migas tacos are good and the machacado and egg as well.  I have tried the enchilada and fajita and was underwhelmed but maybe it was an off day as I have more good experiences than bad.  The staff humors me and my marginal Spanish language skills.
Taqueria La Escondida,34,Great  cheap  plentiful Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes.  Cheerful attentive service.  Hands down  the best Chicken Tortilla Soup in Austin  No Kidding  For  7.00   All served up in a converted Dukin  Donuts from the 80 s.
Taqueria La Escondida,35,OMG BEST TORTA CUBANA EVER   Walked over here from discount tire not expecting much. I am impressed  service is fast and friendly and the food was amazing. The place doesn t look like much from the outside but the inside is not bad at all it s nice and clean and they have free WIFI.
Taqueria La Escondida,36,Just stopped into this little joint over the weekend on a friend s recommendation. I ordered the Parilladas  fajitas    which consisted of a MASSIVE sizzling skillet of well marinated shrimp  chicken and beef  onions and peppers. For under 10 bucks. I took half home and had another full meal. Where else can you find that   According to yelp  there are 611 Mexican restaurants in Austin. You may find better food  but not for the price. Hard to beat the value here.   Don t let the zoo-like fully barred windows throw you off. Service was prompt and friendly. Great salsa. Will be back.
Taqueria La Escondida,37,Great Mexican eat. Their fresh hand-made flour tortillas are amazing and the food is solidly good. Great place to hang out while getting your car serviced at Discount Tires. My fav winter food is their chicken soup and of course the guacamole.
Taqueria La Escondida,38,Very good authentic Mexican food  none of that tex mex bs. The prices are also very reasonable  I got the Carne asada plate  2 al pastor tacos  and a horchata and it was just  15. The Carne asada was a little thin  but was cooked really well  and the al pastor was really really great  some of the best I ve had in Texas. Would go again for sure
Taqueria La Escondida,39,This might be the worst al pastor I have ever had in my life.  I ordered two al pastor tostadas  no tomatoes.   I need to do a body cleanse to get rid of the twelve pounds of grease i consumed after taking one bite.   Those that know me know that I rarely leave a plate unfinished....I left this pile of shit 95  full.  The waitresses didn t even say anything because I think they know how pitiful this place is   as well.      The green sauce that comes with the chips is good.   Everything else I put into my mouth was rancid.  Never again.      If you see me at this place again   you have full permission to kick me in my testicles repeatedly.    I m sorry this isn t one of my best reviews  but I don t have much to say.  Stay AWAY     
Taqueria La Escondida,40,The food here is really good. I used t always order their breakfast tacos and if you come between 6am-11 30am you get 3 for  2 and some change. For the first time last Wednesday I had a meal here after work. They aren t far from my job and I was craving Mexican food. I ordered the beef enchiladas w red sauce and refried beans and rice. First off their chips and salsa are really good and that is a major with me and Mexican restaurants. We barely even got to look at the menu before the waitress was ready to take our orders. It s like jeez give us some time we just sat down. The food was so so. Nothing really special about it but it was good. The prices are good too very cheap. The only bad thing about this place is the service. This place has terrible service.   Not one time did the waitress ever come to our table and ask us if we needed anything or refills on anything. But the other Spanish speaking Mexicans got more service than us of course. My roommate had to try and get her attention to call her over. Second they BARELY just barely speak a little English. I remember once I phoned in an order of breakfast tacos and was wanting to know what ingredients they had. The idiot woman didn t even know what an ingredient was lol. How the heck are you going to be working in the food industry in America yet you don t even know what an ingredient is nor can you speak freaking English. I ve been to better Mexican restaurants than this place. Of course I didn t leave a tip but if I did it would be a verbal one and that would be try and at least attempt to learn English so you can communicate with your customers. Oh and it does take them forever to prepare the food.   Make sure to bring a book because you ll be waiting a long time.
Taqueria La Escondida,41,Good authentic food at an even better price. I got lunch at the recommendation of guys at discount tire next door and was not disappointed.  The enchiladas were great  salsa was fresh  and horchata was on point. I understand some Spanish but can t speak any  and I had no issues. The service was great despite being busy. Only one waitress and she did great keeping up with everyone  I got taken care of right away. Like others have said  it s not TexMex  this was a pro for me    Some tips  seat yourself  try the aguas frescas  and when you re done just walk up to the register - they don t bring a ticket or anything to the table
Taqueria La Escondida,42,This place looks a little rough but it s really good. The tacos are cheap  1.85 and good sized  and the chicken quesadilla is really good too. The waitresses are really nice and u get chips and salsa when you dine in. It was 15 bucks for two people. Not too shabby.
Taqueria La Escondida,43,Authentic mexican food at a very reasonable price. Amazing salsa but need better chips.  1 star deduction because the service can be very slow
Taqueria La Escondida,44,I ve been to this place once before  back when it was La Tapatia  and wasn t impressed.   Well  it reopened recently under a new name  so I thought  What the heck  Why not  .   Oh man  I should ve known better.   Anyway  on to the review...   I ordered two tacos  a gordita  and an aguas fresca.   Taco  1 - Picadillo  ground beef  on corn - First impressions  and you ll notice this as a theme throughout the review  is that this taco was drenched in grease. And  don t get me wrong  I LOVE greasy food  but this was the exception to the rule. Instead of the taco that dipped its toes in the grease pool to test the water  this one swam the English channel of grease over a few days. Absolutely no flavor either--other than the grease. Verdict  Nearly inedible - 1 5.   Taco  2 - Al Pastor  marinated pork  on flour - Again  another grease bomb  but thanks to the flour tortilla  I could eat this one without a bib. Similar to the previous taco  this one really lacked in flavor  which was surprising because I ve never had an al pastor taco this bland before . Verdict  Not very good  but better than eating out of a vending machine - 2 5.   Gordita with Chicharron  fried pork skin  meat - Calling this thing  food  is really a stretch. It was leaking heavily with grease when pulled out the bag and smelled like a grill that hadn t been cleaned in a few days. The chicharron was slimey  almost like it was boiled  and again lacked any flavor. I got about two bites in to this thing before throwing it away. Verdict  I wouldn t force my worst enemy to eat this - 0 5.   The one bright spot was the horchata  cinnamon and milk  aguas fresca which was  surprisingly  refreshing and delicious without being too sweet. Verdict  Actually  pretty good  - 4 5.   Very rare is it when I encounter a restaurant that is worthy of the 1-star rating  but Taqueria La Escondida is quite deserving of this honor. Avoid this place at all costs 
Taqueria La Escondida,45,Yeah if you don t speak Spanish expect to ignored for 10 minutes. Granted the waitress was by herself but she took three people behind me  before she even looked at me. At that moment I just walked out.
Taqueria La Escondida,46,Awesome cheap breakfast tacos.  This is one of our favorite breakfast taco joints in town because I can feed the whole family for under  15.  Tacos are cheap but delicious  coffee is also yummy.  Juice is huge so you can split one of those.
Taqueria La Escondida,47,Will all the fantastic taco trucks nearby  why would you come to this place  Seriously. The al pastor taco I had was so bland  I only ate one bite and promptly drove to the Las Rosas truck for one worth salivating over.
Taqueria La Escondida,48,Favorite place to eat  my personal favorite is the burrito especial. Very friendly staff  very homey kind of restaurant.
Taqueria La Escondida,49,This place is everything I love. The service is always friendly and quick. The tortillas are some of the best I ve ever had  and everything I ve tried has left me with a smile. Don t expect fine dining or easy communication if you don t speak Spanish  but this is incredibly authentic  insanely affordable  with a great family vibe.
Taqueria La Escondida,50,Had to change a tire and I walked in here  they have pretty cheap taco specials so I gave them a try. The food is very blah nothing special so unless your around the area changing a tire I wouldn t make a special trip.
Taqueria La Escondida,51,I really love their breakfast tacos.  There s a certain time in the morning  beginning at 6 30 a.m. when you can get a 3 taco special  must be the same tacos  for a very good price.  The service is very nice.  I like the ambiance of this restaurant.  How-ever  they need to improve on one thing   opening on time in the morning.  The restaurant states that it opens at 6 30 a.m. during a good part of the week.  However  there have been times when the staff arrives late and the place doesn t open until closer to 6 45 a.m.  Today was a disappointing day.  I was starving for breakfast tacos and coffee.  Knowing that they rarely open by the stated time  I arrived at around 6 47 a.m.  The  open  sign was not turned on.  The only person in there was the cook.  He told me that the place wouldn t open until 7 00 a.m.  when I assumed the waitperson s  would arrive.   I usually eat  very  early in the morning  so by that time I was indeed hungry.  I didn t want to wait any further  so I went someplace else close by.  I am very familiar with this restaurant  so I was eagerly looking forward to eating breakfast there early this morning.  Despite it being a favorite place to eat to eat tacos  I wish they d actually open on time...regularly.
Taqueria La Escondida,52,Very good. Prices are reasonable. We got the Camarones Diablo  6 taco plate  and a children s plate.
Taqueria La Escondida,53,I love flautas and this place had legit flautas  They were long and I could see that little holes where the toothpicks were to hold them together when they fried them. That tells me they were fresh and not mass produced like frozen flautas. I would vd given them more than three stars but their beans and rice were just okay. I ve definitely tasted better. Oh and the their salsa is tops  Very authentic and yummy  I will definitely be going back 
Taqueria La Escondida,54,Love their breakfast tacos   Call ahead though because they are made fresh and can take some time  but totally worth the wait 
Taqueria La Escondida,55,This is like a mom and pop shop.  I love it.  The special breakfast tacos are excellent with a wide variety of meats.  I had one each of the chorizo  sausage and bacon and egg.  The salsa is fresh  not store bought bottled stuff.  Then I noticed the menudo - I was full but ordered one to go  Am I glad I did.  The soup was good  but the contents - tripe  hominy served with cilantro  jalape o  and onions with your choice of tortilla.  YUMMMMMMMM.  Good portion size for the price.  Will definitely go back  to have the menudo after a night of partying.
Taqueria La Escondida,56,Authentic reasonably priced and delicious. The food is nothing exceptional but a good place for a filling budget friendly meal. Service is almost always just right. Breakfast is consistently done and their coffee has a slight hint of cinnamon. Yum.
Taqueria La Escondida,57,it is what it is.  cheap jalisco style mexican.  cheap breakfast.   good migas.   i kinda stick with tacos  but the carne asada is pretty good  though the meat is sliced thin  and cooked to death  so its chewy.   still good.   pechuga asada is really good.  its  a butterflied  fileted chicken breast.    service is decent  by committee like a lot of these mexican joints.  ask for the salsa caliente  which is a warm stewed tomato sauce.  i love it  but they never bring it to gringos unless you ask.  wish they made homemade tortillas  but alas no.
Taqueria La Escondida,58,I think you guys are off on this one. While not always super consistent  this place has AMAZING breakfast tacos.  I live and breathe bfast tacos  and I m telling you  they re the sh t  
Taqueria La Escondida,59,Good little Mexican food place. Ate here while waiting for my car over at discount tire. Nice home cooked food
Taqueria La Escondida,60,Anyone that says this place has bad tacos has no idea what they are talking about  or strange taste buds.  The lengua  chiccharon  pastor  tripe and bistec tacos are all amazing and the best Ive had in the City.  WAY better than a Torchy s or something like that.  This place is Authentic and if Im hungry and within 5 minutes of this place I am there.  Make sure to get the corn tortillas.  Yes its a little greasy  but who cares  its delicious    
Taqueria La Escondida,61,If you are here looking for amazing pastor you will be disappointed. However  their carne guisada is VERY good. Beef is tender and sauce is spicy. Chips and salsa also good  and today left a nice slow burn after I was finished. Great place to kill time while getting a flat fixed 
Taqueria La Escondida,62,The food is not bad but the service is absolutely horrible  At least five times I have ordered from them to go on the phone and still had to wait an average of 20 minutes for my order. Today  after waiting 25 minutes I demand my money back and I will not come back 
Taqueria La Escondida,63,I have to agree with Sam S. here guys  this place is easily a 4 5 and depending on what you order  it gets pretty 5 5 sometimes too. The food is Mexican  not Tex-Mex which may throw some people off  but the service and quality of the food is awesome. I don t make it in much for dinner  but if the buzzing crowds during breakfast or lunch are any indication I am not the only fan. I think anyone in should at least try their Migas plate or barbacoa tacos. It has the ambiance  or lack there of  depending on what your needs are  of little East-side dives that have become popular  hitherto only known to the Austin Latino culture. The prices are low because you re paying for the food  not the decor. If your interested in a little authentic yumminess  give it a try. Every place has off days  and I can say that I eat there easily 3 times a week sometimes  for years  under the old name and new  and I have never experienced what is described in the negative reviews. And I encourage those  tried-it-hated-it-never-again reviewers to give it another chance.
Taqueria La Escondida,64,I really hate to write something negative about a family establishment but I really expected more from this place. My first visit  I had tacos  not too bad  typical taqueria tacos. I called for carry out this afternoon and felt compelled to complain about two simple side s that are always over looked in every Mexican Tex-Mex place that I ve been to here while in Austin  rice and beans. Ordered the crispy taco plate. The meat was good  tacos were soggy but it was take out so that s understandable. The rice and beans that came with the plate were beyond bland. Rice was dry  pale  tasteless. The beans were pale as well and had absolutely no flavor.  I don t get it. I ve said this before  I think people just assume they are side items so customers will just pass them over and go to the main dish. Mexican food is supposed to have FLAVOR  Take pride in your cooking  There are people out there who love the simple things in life  At least they didn t hide the bland beans with cheese  like other restaurants.   Just mass produced beans and rice made at the beginning of the day  though I question that because the rice was extremely dry  and forgotten about on the stove. I have yet to find a decent Mexican place to take my parents to when they come to visit me during the holidays D 
Baby Acapulco,1,We took our teenage son for dinner to Baby Acapulco on a Wednesday evening around 5 30pm. We used to frequent this location prior to covid so it had been a while. There was plenty of seating and very spacious. The main  seating area was very clean and looked welcoming with the bright yellow seating.  I ordered a sangria swirl margarita  amp  it was delicious  They do have a happy hour special till 6pm so  2 off frozen margaritas.They do not have a variety of tap beer just the basics. Hopefully they can get a IPA in there soon   Our waiter was Jorge and he was very sweet  amp  attentive to our table. We had the happy hour queso for  5 and it was a good size serving for the 3 of us.There wasn t an actual happy hour menu we were told by Jorge the specials. We couldn t even find it online just the drinks. All of our man dishes were on point  from the presentation to the flavor  I highly recommend the tortilla soup combo.  I m glad we decided to give this location another try  it really has improved.
Baby Acapulco,2,I am leaving one star because they wouldn t sell me a drink. I forgot my ID but am one of those obviously over 21 people. I don t look like I m under 21.  I understand the waitress not wanting to risk it  but the manager refused to even talk to me about it.   It became awkward because our table of 7 was near the register  which he  the manager kept coming over to use .  Sorry  don t like it when people follow rules like comi extremists. But this review is because he wouldn t even talk  might as well have robots serving us I guess.
Baby Acapulco,3,Best chicken soup in town    Load up on fresh cilantro and house-made tortillas. Generous portion  too  
Baby Acapulco,4,This is what I they gave me as a  9.99 nachos  Besides that one of the people that came and spoke to us was coughing.   Stay away from this place
Baby Acapulco,5,Food - 2 5 stars Purple margs 5 5 stars  If you re coming here for a taste of Austin s famous Mexican food  you re in the wrong place. If you re a fan of four lokos  getting tanked  and hitting the town - baby a s got you covered
Baby Acapulco,6,Very good drinks and have lots of friends that go there.Purple and Blue margaritas are the two most sold at this location.  Try it out and enjoy the cold drinks                        that s itBaby A s Famous Soup
Baby Acapulco,7,The building is falling apart and there was a hair in my food. I m sitting hear getting grilled by my gf because of the blood splatter on the wall at the table next to us.
Baby Acapulco,8,If this would allow me to do 0 stars I would.  We went on a slow night and the place was legit empty and we had to wait 10 mins to be seated  Once seated it took another 6-7 mins for our waiter to come and Ask about our drinks.  We got a big Appetizer platter cannot remember the name but once it came out it looked poorly made  Food was stale  Once our main order finally came out it did not look appealing one bit  The beef fajitas were raw they looked medium rare my kids wanted to throw up  There was actual blood in it and the manager don t get me started on that terrible manger He tried to legit tell me he was going to put the fajitas that have been out of the heat for some time now building bacteria on my table we re gonna go back in a pan and he was going to cook them  don t go here don t waste your money   
Baby Acapulco,9,Fantastic server named Caroline   She was sweet  amp  amazing service. The food  and of course the everclear margaritas are thee best 
Baby Acapulco,10,While we like their food and drinks  it s expensive for the quality. They ve starting adding a lot of celery to their dishes  burritos  enchiladas - anything with beef  to make them seem fuller. This place is dirty dingy and does not inspire confidence of the cleanliness of the kitchen. There s been a smoke detector near that bar that s had a low battery for eons  by the time I leave I ve developed an eye twitch from listening to it crack off every 60 seconds. Bottom line  you can do better if you re looking for TexMex.
Baby Acapulco,11,The more I eat here  the better the food. My favorites are the tacos  rice  charro beans  and churros.
Baby Acapulco,12,Every time I visit Austin  this place is a must stop every time  for a variety of reason. First off  this is not the only location in town that I have visited  but this one gets the review this time. If you want to try a joint that offers good Tex-Mex with large portions that are spot on with the price  this is the place. Everyone in my family left happy and full.  The salsa and chips are delicious. While the chips are just standard store bought chips  we easily went through 3 bowls of salsa   more please     We also share a chile con queso appetizer that was very good as well. Nice consistency and the right amount of heat.  I ordered the cowboy enchiladas  meat enchiladas smothered in Chile con carne and Chile con queso  rice and beans on the side  cue drooling mouth   .   I hear Ed from a bird  that the famous purple Rita s are delicious but you are only allowed two due their potency  and I never leave without buying an awesome shirt  which my wife loves to wear for pjs  get the soft fabric . Hope you enjoy 
Baby Acapulco,13,In two ways  I agree with some of the negative reviews- I can t say much for the service or price. It wasn t HORRIBLE  but I would describe it as barely adequate.   However  this is still getting four stars because of the food and drink  Man  we enjoyed this a lot. We got the dip and fajitas and enjoyed it thoroughly. One thing I really appreciated is how good the individual elements were. The meat was treated well  the beans and rice were good  and the cheese dip was awesome. Even the pico was delicious- chewing individual tomato chunks in a fajita gave so much flavor  Food was plentiful and we ate to our heart s content.   The drinks are delicious- beware  though  they re creepers  There s a high alcohol content.   I wouldn t recommend this as a pre-drinking stop. For us  lunch and a couple margaritas followed by a nap was perfect.   We will be back 
Baby Acapulco,14,This is one of the older Baby As in Austin located off of Riverside. Its on the smaller side in an older building and usually gets quite busy.  Tonight however was a bit on the slow side.  We were seated immediately and asked about drinks. Of course the family ordered the Purple Rita and I had a glass of wine.  My daughter ordered her usual - Helen s Combo as we absolutely love the Chicken Tortilla Soup here at Baby As. The soup was as good as ever as well as the chicken tacos.   My husband ordered the Taco Salad and I think he regretted it as he was still hungry after eating it but he enjoyed it none the less.  They do offer a la carte items and I ordered the Chili Relleno with cheese - one of my favorite tex mex food items. It was delicious and huge.  Yellow melty cheese on the inside and an egg battered poblano pepper on the outside which was smothered in a yummy red chili relleno sauce.   Service was good and food was good.  The location on Howard remains to be my favorite though.
Baby Acapulco,15,Purple Margs get the job done  I just wish they would have a scale on hand and let people who are 200  pounds order a third one. I have a disease and the only thing that would cure it is 3 Baby A s purple margaritas.
Baby Acapulco,16,I was surprised but how good this Baby A s is  The service is great. They are very quick and friendly. Get the margarita sampler so you can try as many flavors as you can. You can pick and choose which ones you want  they come with four. There is a small parking lot that combines with the 7-11 so sometimes it s difficult to find parking. The later it gets  the rowdier this area gets so come earlier if you want to steer clear of this. I ve had several dishes here throughout the years and everything is standard Tex-mex  nothing amazing but will do its job 
Baby Acapulco,17,My wife and I used to go To Baby A s when we lived in Austin years ago  but we had never been to this particular location on Riverside Dr. the original location.    Flash forward 15 years and we had an opportunity to have lunch in Austin and chose Baby A s on Riverside.  The servicePriscilla  was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed for an enjoyable experience. She was friendly and sincere.  She wanted us to enjoy ourselves  and we did. She was amazing. The food--it was excellent.  Hot  fresh  and flavorful.  I had the cheese enchiladas and my wife had puffy tacos.  The couple we were with also had enchiladas and the street tacos.  If you are lucky enough to live in Austin or you plan to visit  check out this original Mexican restaurant and be sure to ask for Priscilla.  You will be in for a real treat 
Baby Acapulco,18,Horrible service  Ordered a Togo at 7 38 last night and I was told it d be done in 15 minutes  got there at and had to wait 30 minutes not to mention my boyfriend and 11.5 month old daughter were waiting In the car. We finally got our food  large soup and a stuffed avocado  and the stuffed avocado received brand and Mexican rice were cold. Pretty sad seeings how we live not even ten mins away.
Baby Acapulco,19,I came here for to meet up for lunch hour with some co-workers  and unfortunately  this is probably the WORST first experience I ve ever had with a restaurant. Do yourself a favor and don t get your time wasted here.  After waiting 45 minutes  we were finally informed that the kitchen staff had  lost  our order. While it s fine  sort of  for the restaurant to make a mistake  what is NOT fine is how they went about rectifying the situation  or lack thereof . The wait staff really didn t seem to care  the manager didn t seem to care  and it really seemed like no one working here at this restaurant cared about the MESS UP they made. We FINALLY got our food at 55 minutes after ordering  and we heard NO apology  just blaming of other staff .  Once we finally got a hold of the supposedly  very busy  manager  we were finally able to get here to actually pay attention to what was going on in the restaurant she s supposedly  managing.   Probably the only time and the LAST time I ll be here - bye 
Baby Acapulco,20,Come for the purple margarita  stay for the chimichangas. Keidric took such good care of us and made the experience that much better.
Baby Acapulco,21,My fajita nachos had no meat   The location off Barton Springs is so much better    They have really gone down hill from when I used to come here for happy hour   
Baby Acapulco,22,Brittanee took amazing care of us. Super attentive service and very hospitable to our needs. You could see her smile with her eyes as of course she and the staff are being responsible with masks. Thank you 
Baby Acapulco,23,Eh. It s okay but really not very good. It looked like everything on the menu was going to have a sweet-ish sauce with it. Sweet habanero sauce   Why  Many of the drinks looked like sugary slushies. My Mexican Martini was too sweet as well. I mean  I could drink it  but would rather have had less o.j. Or none at all.   My shrimp tacos were okay but nothing to really write about  except that one of the tortillas had a stale end  arc segment  Corner   that I elected to just tear off rather than complain about. I saw tiny bubbles on the surface of my little cup of black beans and that worried me  as I associate that closely with an almost certain and urgent evacuation of the bowles.  There are a few redeeming qualities though. My server  Dulce  was a shining example of good service even though I came in hangry and annoyed that there was scarce parking. They also appear to have a bubbly crowd of down-to-earth regulars that fill out the place.
Baby Acapulco,24,Visited this baby A S yesterday for dinner with a few friends and it was great. I m not sure why there s so many negative reviews because our food and service were fantastic.   It was a little slow so our waitress  Susan  had even come over and sat down to talk with us. She was friendly and made great suggestions for food and drink choices.   We shared queso as a table and it was fantastic. I ordered jerrys burrito and was pleasantly surprised when it came to me SMOTHERED in queso cheese. It was definitely not what I was expecting but I very much enjoyed it.
Baby Acapulco,25,Your dip is the shit first off        Happy Hour was interesting we had chicken tacos and some smothered in love fries. I don t know what they are really called but we really liked them.The atmosphere was calm and happy the hostess with the mostest  -Amanda- welcomed us in with a  smile and quickly seated us. We will definitely return.. Thank you 
Baby Acapulco,26,Becca was my server and she was fantastic  She managed to advise us on the drinks even though she hasn t tried the drinks herself. She was super friendly and super attentive. We live around the corner and consider Baby A s an extension of our kitchen.
Baby Acapulco,27,My girlfriend and I decided to dine-in at Baby A s yesterday  the atmosphere is considerably loud because the drinks are pretty decent  this would be a good thing  until the environment gets out of hand. A small encounter broke out between several guests  the staff did nothing to stop it and now  I understand why because the waitress took the opportunity among the chaos to bring us our check. Distracted by the uninterrupted chaos I sign the check electronically and leave our waitress a decent tip. We received no receipt  my girlfriend decided to add the meals and drinks up herself and noticed a discrepancy. We returned to the restaurant to get a physical receipt  our waitress brings out a receipt that does not add up to our bank statement and as we are reviewing it she is hovering around us to the point we had to just walk out the door as to not feel pressured to leave  she oddly follows us to the door. We return to see that we have been charged double for a tip  we ask for the manager and yet again our waitress returns to ask if everything is okay. We kindly tell her we are not seeking her help we need to speak to the manager. The manager comes out and we show him that our statement does not match the receipt our waitress brought out  he then questions where we got the figure from  we show him our bank statement.  The manager goes to the register to figure out the problem while guess who hovered over his shoulder  after 15 minutes the manager returns saying we were charged twice for a drink  this did not show up on two receipts the manager and waitress brought out  The manager then tells us that the transaction wasn t complete and we should see our actual bill on our bank statement. Nope statement still is overcharged and now we are curious as to how many more discrepancies like ours have gone unchecked due to the loud and chaotic environment.  Will not be returning  the food is mediocre as it is but we thought the drinks were with it but now that we see that they take advantage of  customers I can t imagine spending another dime here.
Baby Acapulco,28,Baby A s has some great food. I would highly recommend Baby A s famous soup  best soup I have ever had. The staff was great. Definitely ask for Mariah as your server. She served my group so well and she takes her job very seriously. She made the experience so much better with her friendliness and genuine personality. Even when I noticed her serving other tables she would be putting smiles on peoples faces. Food was damn good 
Baby Acapulco,29,Charges additional fees for take out..really  Online and in person...I knew they did this pre -covid-19 but still...
Baby Acapulco,30,Took my daughter to Baby A s for drinks and tacos  to celebrate her 21st birthday.  First we were pleased to find out that happy hour is from 2 - closing on Mondays. Then our waiter  Preston  told us about the happy hour menu.  We ordered the  street tacos and that purple drink .  Who in the world can drink two of those    The chips and salsa was . I also ordered the tortilla soup  to go.  Overall we had a great time  in part to the stellar service we received from Preston . He was sweet  courteous  attentive and knowledgeable about the menu.  The parking leaves a bit to be desired but I will be back for the AMOR-ES TACOS  Ask for Preston 
Baby Acapulco,31,Would have been ok had our waitress not had the worst attitude ever. I walked outside to have a beer and a smoke and was reported to the manager that I stepped outside with a drink...never mind that there was security guard right at the door entrance that could have corrected me. I was treated with total disrespect after that and still left a tip to the waitress that horrible. The waitress scolded me and threw my bill on the table. This location sucks and I won t spend my money there again. Btw my bill was  200. I gave 10  when I normally tip 30 . I should have tipped anything 
Baby Acapulco,32,I went to Baby A s for the first time recently and fell in love. From the puffy tacos to the queso to the sweet  amp  stiff strawberry margaritas  I left with my tummy and friends very happy. Courtney was our sever. She is lovely  friendly and provided prompt service. I always pay attention to see if servers offer to refill drinks when they see they re low and if they clear dirty dishes quickly  and she met all of my expectations with flying colors.  I convinced my new job to have a  team building  activity after work one day. I m confident we will receive excellent service and delicious food again.   The only thing that sucks is the lack of parking.
Baby Acapulco,33,They have a small bar and this place is supposed to be a place to eat . They have 2 signs . A 30.06 and a 30.07 . Not 2nd Amendment friendly . I will not be coming back. 30.06 is for a business that carries a 51  sign . This bar isn t really what I d say brings in the customers . It s not even worth photographing. Anyone that comes here that expects to feel welcomed and CC s   your not welcomed . Actually liked this place a while back . They have lost a costumer .
Baby Acapulco,34,The quality of the rusty worn out sign is your first sign to beware. The inside is in the same condition. It looks like neither the outside nor the inside have had any upkeep since the day they opened. The inside smells so bad. Like an old musty building that has old carpet and is probably still all the old unchanged materials from back when smoking inside was legal. You eat with your nose  not just your eyes. The smell still is with me. It doesn t matter at this point if the food is good or bad  it was average Tex mex   if the memory of the place makes you afraid to eat it...and definitely not wanting to come back.   And we got take out  but just waiting in there was enough . Sadly  in their current state they may not stay in business  when they re in a great location and with average food  a makeover could really help them do well business wise.
Baby Acapulco,35,I came after work for happy hour with coworkers. In the midst of having a good time  we were rudely interrupted by another patron. Instead of management deescalating the situation  they approached our table accusing us of being the problem. We explained the issue and our concerns were not taken into consideration. I have never in my restaurant experience felt so excluded and embarrassed. I will not be returning and will be sharing my experience with others.
Baby Acapulco,36,Holy moly  Baby A s hit the spot  Their chicken fajita tacos are the perfect serving size and full of flavor  Also incredible service   Kudos to Mariah  ask for her by name if you want top notch table service and good vibes   
Baby Acapulco,37,Visited Baby Acapulco yesterday and tried the Amores Tacos... it was really awesome   The corn on the cob could uae a bit more flavor but otherwise the sauce and everything was great.  We were kindly served by very charming young man name RJ.... We will definitely return in visit again whenwe passed through Texas.. doesn t look like much on the outside but I was surprisingly pleased Burgundy of water by the street tacos and of course by our waiter thanks RJ 
Baby Acapulco,38,This place is an awesome choice if you want some drinks and appetizers. The purple margaritas are so strong and placed at a good price. They actually only will give you two of the purple margaritas but two is plenty. My friends and I always like to go here for some chips and dips and drinks before a night out. Service is always great and food or drinks never take too long. Only negative is that the food isn t my absolute favorite. if I want good Mexican food it isn t my first choice  however  it all comes for a good price.
Baby Acapulco,39,Loved this place  Super affordable and great margaritas  What really made my night was having an amazing waitress  Mariah  She was very helpful when my friend and I were indecisive on choosing a margarita and asked if we wanted to try the flight  Couldn t have had a better girls night  and the sopes were delicious  Ask for Mariah as your server  she s the sweetest and is eminently knowledgeable of the menu  amp  their drinks 
Baby Acapulco,40,Well the purple marg and cask is  ight..  It s super close to home so since we are feeling the convince vibes and purple vibes and caso vibes we out here.
Baby Acapulco,41,The margaritas are good and the food is mediocre. I wouldn t consider this restaurant  chain  an authentic Tex-Mex spot  but the food is not entirely inauthentic either.   Service is average and actual physical environment is a bit rundown so I wouldn t recommend celebrating any birthdays special events here.
Baby Acapulco,42,Gas station strip mall Tex Mex  whaddya expect   I wanted to get drunk and full of good food.  I didn t succeed at either of these goals.  Lower your expectations for this place and you miiight feel ok when leaving.  They serve their chips hot but I don t think these are made in house - they taste like slightly stale chips that are relying on the heat to cover the fact that they re a few days old.  The salsa was awesome though.  The service was decently fast  especially considering we had a table of 9-10.  My biggest disappointment of the meal was the overhyped purple margarita.  On a completely empty stomach  I barely felt a buzz from the first one.  I was halfway through the second before our food even showed up and I frankly still wasn t feeling it.  It was too sugary  and when I ordered the second and the server said  you know you are limited to two right   I m pretty sure my face was a face to make angels cry.  I was so sad.  I ordered the Deluxe Dinner because I had a deep  abiding hunger.  The refried beans were actually pretty good.  The tamales were awful  maybe the worst I ve ever had.  Chewy  dry  tasteless  was I eating corn cardboard   I subbed in a puffy taco and thought it was decently delicious if messy - it s something different at least.  In general  I was left full but unsatisfied on the tastiness front.
Baby Acapulco,43,My overall experience was nothing less than amazing. My waitress Sonny was exceptional and very knowledgeable about the menu front and back. She recommended excellent options to eat and drink. The food was tasty and the drinks definitely packed a punch. If you r not sure on what you d like to drink  I d suggest getting the The celebrity or Tropical drink flight. You get a sampler or 4 different drinks from both. My favorite was the coconut. If it wasn t for Sonny then I would have never known about the drink. All in all I d go back  the food was good and Sonny made me feel welcomed.
Baby Acapulco,44,I haven t been to Baby A s in quite a while but ended up there Friday. We had queso  veggie fajitas and the shrimp quesadilla and it was all on point  The food was much better than I remember  my drink was not though. I had a beer margarita and it just didn t taste like there was much tequila in it at all. I see a lot of reviews here saying service wasn t good but our server was actually great. If you want some Mexican food and don t feel like getting dressed up Baby A s is just fine. If you want a fancy drink go somewhere else.
Baby Acapulco,45,Sergio was our waiter and was awesome  We wanted a  pile of nachos  which they don t make. That make the individual nachos  like most in Austin  eye roll  . Sergio knew that s what we wanted so he got all the ingredients and made them for us   Woop  They were delicious 
Baby Acapulco,46,Would like to post a no star review.   Went there with my family and another family for lunch on Sunday. Had quite possibly the worst customer service I have ever had at a restaurant in Austin.   In addition to the horrid service  the menu is misleading. As a vegetarian  Tex Mex is always a good go to. However  I was all set to order a dish marked as  V - meat free  on the menu when I noticed an asterisk that explained that that the sauce and rice that came with it contained chicken stock  When I asked if the server could find out if anything on the menu was vegetarian  it took her 15 minutes to get back to me  There was only one other table in the place  only to tell me that the cooks didn t know. She then pointed to the dish marked  V  and I had to explain to her  again  what this issue was. I ended up ordering a salad. Of course  the server came over after I ordered it to ask me if I wanted chicken on it   
Baby Acapulco,47,Love this location  always positive atmosphere and GREAT service. My family and I have been coming for years and has never been a bad day. Huge props to the manager LUIS always happy and social to the entire restaurant as well as Karolyn and Brandon Top servers in the building  Thank you guys for doing your best everyday it truly means a lot us 
Baby Acapulco,48,I payed 9 dollars for the Carne Guisada and this is all they gave me. Please be wary of ordering delivery from Baby A s... literally gave me a salad with a side of beef. Really guys    
Baby Acapulco,49,We ate at the on the river location for my daughter s graduation - service was horrendous  waitress refused to bring me water after I complained about how they handled last call and were still bringing other tables drinks. The manager was just as bad if not worse in how he handle the situation - clueless  I ve been eating at Baby A s as long as I can remember taking family  friends and customers anytime I get a chance. El Mercado will now be getting all my business and anyone I speak to about great restaurants in Austin 
Baby Acapulco,50,Solid 3 star place. A-OK is right.   The foodie in me doesn t want to review this place. I know it s not a favorite on Yelp  but since I typically enjoy when I eat here - I might as well say something. And this is the only location I ve ever been to  since I am in the area a lot. Which is why I stopped by in the first place.   It s a little confusing and awkward to seat yourself at Baby A s  because the Seat Yourself really only applies to the main dining area with the bar. Once you find your way to an empty table  the server has to spot you before you can start the ordering process. This can take anywhere from 1-10  minutes depending on a lot of things. Once you order  the food comes fast. I d recommend the fajitas or the puffy tacos. You can t really go wrong. It s all pretty typical Tex-Mex and fairly cheap too    Baby A s is a hassle-free place that you can grab a cheap meal and cheap beer. I wouldn t recommend this place to tourists  but I would consider it an Austin staple. It serves a purpose and it does it well.
Baby Acapulco,51,The food and drinks were absolutely amazing    Make sure to get the famous purple Rita. They are strong and SO refreshing  Tony was so personable and made us feel so welcome  He deserves a raise. Priscilla was a great server and very attentive. She also deserves a raise. Highly recommend coming here  10 10
Baby Acapulco,52,I can see why this place has such poor yelp reviews. Food and drinks were good but my girlfriends car got towed from outside and the manager  a Louis Cardenas was the rudest person I have ever encountered in a professional setting. After claiming he told our table that a car was being towed   which all 6 of us at the table somehow missed  he got the police officer that they strangely have on location to escort me out just because I was upset by his rudeness. I used to love this place. Will NEVER GO BACK and am telling my friends to follow suit. Don t go here  they have 0 respect for their customers.
Baby Acapulco,53,It s normally a tradition for us to come to Baby A s  We ve been many times over the last few years. For the first time ever I am extremely disappointed in the service. Our waitress  Estrella  was extremely ill-mannered and contemptuous. When the issue of her attitude was addressed she got really offensive and sent her manager to our table. Her manager   Jefferson Banks  also had an impolite attitude. I ve never been so disappointed in a trip to this establishment before. Truthfully  this is the first time I ve ever had terrible service. Buuut   Dulce  our new waitress was very kind  
Baby Acapulco,54,Just had a great meal and plenty of solid drinks  Good ambiance for fun people  Ask for the waiter extraordinaire  Fabian   ignacio  nacho  6points
Baby Acapulco,55,I am very disappointed with this restaurant. My wife and I went to have dinner and it was extremely overpriced. The drinks were great but the food was very poor and expensive. I asked for extra tortillas and was charged almost six dollars for two. My wife changed beef for ground beef on one taco and she was charged five dollars. First time there and also the last.     There is also no parking and I REALLY recommend and will always go to Trydus. their mexican martinis are realy good.
Baby Acapulco,56,Wow. I have been going to Baby A s for almost ten years and I will say that they have some of the BEST tortilla soup I ve ever had. However  I think today was my last visit...  I placed a to-go order and paid almost  20 for soup and an order of queso...  20. I m fairly certain their prices have gone up and I know for sure that I received way less food than I have in the past.  The chips and queso  salsa included  were  6 but the containers were about half full... They used to be filled to the brim. The chips are now prepackaged and they give you about 1 3 of what they used to give...  I get it. Austin is growing and real estate prices are through the roof  but has the person making all these changes seen this place    For a  20 meal  I expect to sit in a place that s been renovated in the past 20 years. I will also mention that I get my food to go because the service at this location is usually terrible.   Another tip for first timers... plan to wait for a parking spot as there are about 10 spots for the entire restaurant.   I really hope they can get it together soon or they probably won t last. Best of luck  Baby A s.
Baby Acapulco,57,Was in town for work on the hunt for a hot Mexican plate and some good marg s  I decided to pull up to Baby A s and they hit the mark  Have to mention my friendly waitress Sarah because she recommended the purple margarita and that there was a limit of 2. Naturally I accepted the challenge and met the limit. Thanks again Sarah for your recommendation and great service  I shall return 
Baby Acapulco,58,My fiance and I both got food poisoning from this place and we re still laying in bed trying to recover from it. So if you like the idea of laying in bed and vomiting all day - then this is the place for you.  We had Chicken Fajitas  Salsa Chips  and Baby A s Deluxe Dinner. We both think it was the Chicken Fajitas that may have caused it   I m really disappointed because I had been wanting to try this location for awhile. Upon walking in  it looked a little dumpy and dirty on the inside  but I figured I would give this place a shot. I wish I would have went with my gut feeling that a dirty environment might equate to bad food.  We received excellent service - I ll give Baby A s a 10 10 for that. But the food is a very important aspect of business and this place simply can t be trusted. Sorry.
Baby Acapulco,59,Drove in from Dallas.... wanted some good food and drinks so I couldn t think of a better place to go other than Baby As. Our first time at this location and we couldn t have had a better waitress.  Heather was awesome      From her jokes to her service Heather was great. We re hoping we can stop in once more before heading back to Dallas.
Baby Acapulco,60,Good Mexican food. Their tortilla soup is fresh and delicious. Good Mexican martinis.  Wait staff was attentive and didn t make us wait long for our drinks or dinner. I will definitely be back 
Baby Acapulco,61,Big shout out to the crew at this Baby A s off of Riverside.  I had a late lunch early dinner yesterday. The fish tacos were so good  as was the guacamole  to say nothing of the awesome margheritas.  Shone  my waiter stood out  for his warmth  kindness and service. He is quick on his feet  attentive and personable. I am shy  came alone for a quick bite and he made me feel welcome and at home. In a town full of indifference  I found good service  hospitality and tasty food yesterday. For this I am grateful. Thank you  Dea.
Baby Acapulco,62,I loved my whole experience Estrella was a great server and waitress   She advised me that the tacos were so good carnitas and the margaritas were awesome thank you 
Baby Acapulco,63,I love going to Baby A s for Happy Hour or to watch a sporting event. The Purple margarita is my favorite  but give the Superman a try as well  I visited on August 18th  and funny enough it was our waitress s Estrella V. first day  She was very friendly  as are most of the staff  and was very attentive to our needs. Too many times people only go to sites like this just to complain  so when I have a good experience I try to make that known as well.  My only complaint about this location is PARKING   I visited Draft Pick a lot when it was in business. When they closed  I hoped that Baby A s would have jumped into their location. It was already set up for a bar type place  and parking is way better  there is a parking garage .   All in all I have great experiences each time I visit   Thanks 
Baby Acapulco,64,I m new to Austin and i thought i d stop by since i ve passed by a few times. Luckily it was a great choice i had Becca as my server and she was so kind. Nothing in my order was messed up and my food came quickly  Will be back soon
Baby Acapulco,65,We just went for happy hour and a good margarita  We are from Dallas and have been missing the other location off 35 the last year. So we found this one and let me tell you.... Courtney S was great  Very attentive and not overbearing  asked the right questions at the right times. Thank you Courtney. Ps love the queso and the chips are amazing 
Baby Acapulco,66,Seriously if I could zero stars I would. Do y all hire anyone with any experience  This was the worst visit I ve had at any single restaurant. Who trained Brittanee   A constant need to say  I ll be right back.  when presented with an order really says a lot about the sense of urgency in your deliveries. Don t order a side of rice and beans if you d like to wait 20 minutes for them. I m no expert but I m pretty sure that has already been prepped. You could ve scooped it out yourself  or maybe Carolynn could have. Get real. NEVER GOING BACK
Baby Acapulco,67,Solid option if you re looking for a no frills tex mex spot in Austin. You ll get a lot of bang for your buck  large portions and strong drinks.   It s a very casual spot  so don t plan to impress anyone here. But do plan to leave with a full belly  especially with the delicious fresh chips and salsa.   Ask for Heather as your waitress  she explained all of the drinks and dishes and was very attentive to our table.
Baby Acapulco,68,I am a 69 year old man that had to produce drivers license to show I was over 21 Years of age. I was told that this was a TABC rule which is a falsehood. They need to use some common sense. They should respect seniors. I will not be back again.
Baby Acapulco,69,Estrella was so much fun   And she took of us despite our challenges  the point point system was hard to figure out. I thought I was gonna get free drink. Oh well  I feel great
Baby Acapulco,70,Heather is an amazing waitress  I had a surprisingly amazing time at this location - I highly recommend coming here and requesting her. She was hilarious and gave impeccable service. This is coming from someone in the industry. A plus Heather 
Baby Acapulco,71,Came here to be for the couple of the people and as soon as we sat down at a food to our surprise there was a gigantic cockroach chiling on the window seal.. we moved seats to another area and a server came to take our order he failed to introduce in himself  and did not say much just asked if we were ready. We told the server when you have some time and you walked away without saying anything and seemed  upset that we were not ready. The food was mediocre the service was very poor.   the parking situation is horrible and the place itself looks disgusting and left unclean. I doubt I will ever return to this location as nothing about it seems good. A message to baby A s owner shut this location down and build something in a better spot..
Baby Acapulco,72,It is with a heavy heart that I will never go back to Baby A s again. So long purple margaritas. So long delicious Baby Changa. Adios queso... While the service at every single location is atrocious  this location takes the cake. We stood in line at the door for 20 minutes while I swear every member of the staff  including the manager  walked by a growing group of confused patrons without so much as mentioning how long the wait would be.   When we finally flagged the bumbling amateur that is the manager down he stared at us blankly as if confused that restaurants extend the courtesy of taking your name down in the order you arrive and let you know how long you ll be waiting. Instead he just said  well we re busy and it ll probably be an hour there are six groups ahead of you  I don t have time for this . Wrong  there were four groups and 5 empty tables that needed to be cleaned as we watched the patrons who were sitting there pay their checks and leave... Had there been a dedicated host or attentive bus staff the line building at the door would have been handled in an orderly fashion. Instead this glorious pinnacle of customer service said he was simply too busy to assist the growing line of potential income that just wanted to put their name on a list and know how long they d be waiting.   I don t care if I have to wait an hour  so long as you have the decency to tell me that s how long I ll be waiting and not treat me like some a-hole who s mucking up your establishment. I will never give you another penny and will ensure no one I know does either.  And your parking sucks.
Baby Acapulco,73,For those of you who know me. I always ask for a military discount as I am a combat veteran  and the difference is always added as extra to my tip. Denny s on oltorf and 35 know this about me as well. This evening I was denied because Carlos couldn t recognize my VA I d card. Should I stop coming here  Only rei still come was the respect I get walking in was welcoming  new management made that go away
Baby Acapulco,74,Derik was really on his game today  Fast and on time with everything...i will Definitely be back to see him....Thanks Derik 
Baby Acapulco,75,Picture this  you re working on your laptop  your boyfriend is hangry  he wants cheap Mexican food but alas all the food trucks only accept cash. In despair you turn to google and find Baby A s. Your uber pulls up to a seven eleven. Confusion strikes and then you notice the unlit Baby A s sign. The drinks  strong. The food  cheap but totally worth it. The atmosphere  hilarious. If you or a loved one find yourself in a hangry and thirsty situation seek out Baby A s immediately.
Baby Acapulco,76,Went here on cinco de mayo and had the beef fajitas for two with my husband and it was so good  Probably the best fajitas I ve had in a while. Looking for parking was a little difficult because we didn t want to get towed but eventually we found one  not a big deal. Compared to the other restaurants we tried to go to that day we were sat fairly quickly  our servers name was Jackie and she was such a sweetheart  got our food out in a timely manner  never had to worry about asking for a refill. I definitely look forward to coming back and seeing Jackie again. We also got some margaritas and they were deliciously strong and I was loving the Spanish music  especially for cinco de mayo 
Baby Acapulco,77,Has a great meal and the margaritas are the best  Carolyn our waitress  was terrific   I ll ask for her section from now on.
Baby Acapulco,78,I give this location mainly based on the incredible service I have received in the past 2 years that I have lived in the community. I live very near this location  and frequently go in to grab something to eat and work on things because it is walking distance from my home.   Day or night  weekend or weekday  my service is always personable  helpful and prompt. In the numerous times I have been in there  only once or twice did I not have great service. The staff is easy going and fun  and I enjoy chatting with them.   The food has its high points and not so high points but I would recommend the following for sure  Chips  salsa and margaritas are always a winner  Quesadillas are great  get the beef fajita  Flautas plate is a value and very tasty Taco salad is good Chimichangas are good too  I was very impressed by the service especially lately when the manager and the IT guy bent over backwards to help me get my laptop online  I was seriously impressed. That is customer service an owner and company should be proud of 
Baby Acapulco,79,We have not been to Baby A s for more than a year due to poor quality and slow service. We decided to give them another try  but left before even ordering. They won t sell you alcohol without seeing id  regardless of age. Didn t have mine on me. Oh well  lost a customer. Won t be back.
Baby Acapulco,80,The food is great but there is also a fun lively atmosphere. Our server Brittany was a lot of fun 
Baby Acapulco,81,Went to lunch there yesterday and received great service   We were seated right away  our server Carolyn was quick with our drinks and food too. She didn t let our drinks go empty  that is my husband s pet peave.  Food was delish   Great spot to have lunch.  Ask for Carolyn 
Baby Acapulco,82,Our waiter wasn t very friendly and did the very minimum of what you should do when waiting tables  he didn t offer any refills  I never got his name and we had to ask for silverware when he delivered the food. Over all my margarita was pretty looking but too strong to completely enjoy since all the slush melted right away. The quesadillas were good but i paid  10 for them and they didn t come with any sides so I feel that overall it s over priced for the quality. I would recommend El Taquito across the street rather than this place.
Baby Acapulco,83,Love this place    Great place to get together with family and friends. Awesome drinks   I personally love the  Blue  margarita. Made to perfection on all their drinks   Cant get enough of their chips and salsa  -  Yummy Chile Con Queso  damn good Tortilla Soup  and Love Love Love their Chicken Quesadillas  -   -    O-yea   Awesome Happy Hour prices    2-7pm  I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good drink and awesome food  -   - 
Baby Acapulco,84,Amazing chips and salsa   A variety of yummy  margarita flavors   Parking sucks and it looks like a hot mess from the outside  but don t let that stop you.  Definitely coming back here when I m in Austin 
Baby Acapulco,85,I stopped in Saturday for my Purple Rita fix and tacos. I sat at the bar and was pleasantly surprised by the new bartender  Rebecca  A breathe of fresh air she was. Charming and attentive   i do hope she sticks around.
Baby Acapulco,86,Baby A s has a serious love-it-or-hate-it reputation in Austin and this location  there are two  probably skews the votes due to its no-frills funky gas station corner location.   Seating was quick and pleasant around dinner-time and the menu leans decidedly towards Tex-Mex.  Chips came out quick and warm with a salsa that kicked unapologetically. Due to its legendary status  I ordered a purple margarita  which comes frozen with no salt at a limit of two per person. Color me excited.   Appetizer offerings include Ceviche Acapulco Style  Queso Con Shrimp  Shrimp Nachos  Sliders and Wings.  Told you it was Tex-Mex.   Taco plates varied from the Puffy Tacos  two puffy taco shells filled with ground beef or shredded chicken  lettuce  tomato and chile con queso served with Mexican rice and charro beans  to Acapulco Fish Tacos made of grilled or fried tilapia with corn or flour tortillas  green and red cabbage  avocado  sliced tomato  fresh cilantro and Monterey jack cheese. Soups and salads are offered in abundance as well as  famous  wet burritos and burgers.   After finishing off a rather skimpy serving of chips  I opted for the ceviche while poring over the dinner menu.  Along with the requisite fajitas and enchiladas stood out offerings such as Flautas De Pollo  Flaca Platter  fried flour tortilla with shredded chicken and Monterey jack cheese topped with tomato base sauce   Chicken Breast Gratinada  marinated and charbroiled  topped with bell peppers  mushrooms  tomatoes  onions and Monterey jack cheese  and Baby A s Deluxe Dinner  beef enchilada  tamale  chicken flauta  beef taco  chalupa and chile com queso nachos.   The decision came down to Grilled Mahi-Mahi with seafood sauce  rice  black beans and sliced avocado on lettuce.   The ceviche was chunky  plentiful and had a serious pyro punch. No wimpy cracker dressing here and the portion was huge. We likes.   The mahi platter didn t fare as well with the fish coming out tough and dry  made only slightly more palatable by the spicy seafood sauce. The  Mexican  rice tasted more like Chinese fried rice  not a bad thing  but huh   and the rest of the meal was good.  Great avocado  though.   Which leaves that purple margarita  and all I ve got to say is this  proceed with caution. Even at a limit of two  you ll get the point by the first two sips.   All said  I enjoyed the locale  atmosphere  and though it wasn t a perfect dining experience  and where do you find that   I d come back to explore more of the menu.
Baby Acapulco,87,Simply delicious our server Rebecca made such a memorable impression  She recommended the large queso it went well.
Baby Acapulco,88,Came in for lunch just for some soup I heard it was really good here the only other time I ve been to a baby A s was about a year ago and it was a horrible experience . this time around it was slow the service was great and the food tasted goodNo complaints this time around the music was good and it s a cool environment I ll be back for sure
Baby Acapulco,89,My meal was perfect and delicious  Our server Carolyn brought everything out hot and fresh  and delivered it all with a smile. Wonderful experience  I can t wait to come back on my next visit to Austin 
Baby Acapulco,90,Stopped in for a quick meal last Thursday and had a GREAT meal  Carolyn had great customer service and was very attentive. She suggested the beef Fajitas and they were AMAZING.  We will definitely be returning soon for a good meal and margaritas    
Baby Acapulco,91,This place just hits the spot after you ve biked 20 miles in 90 degree humidity and dunked in the Barton springs and watched the sunset and return here by bike after sunset. The patio has a weird John waters vibe and also reminds me of the scene in Y T  mama Tambien when the main characters take a road trip from Mexico City to a remote beach village and get wasted in this tourist cafe  only instead of zapoteca  six   fishing villagers it s a bunch of chill Texan people and college kids. The fajita tempts you to think that Baja California might still be a Hippie enclave still full of surfers and tejano Mexican dudes but it could also be full of  rich spring break Americans chanting offensive stuff about Latino people and wearing bad fashion. Life is about living on the edge of good and evil
Baby Acapulco,92,The BEST chicken tortilla soup  affordable meals drinks  perfect thickness of chips  well seasoned mildly spicy salsa   amp  great waitstaff  Mari is very helpful   As a local institution it is a constant for Austinites and I m glad you have SURVIVED      5 Stars doesn t have to mean white table cloths and a million dollar view.
Baby Acapulco,93,Had a great experience here  the food and drinks were overralreally great   Our waitress Carolyn was amazing as well   great suggestions and overall had very great service from her we will for sure be back to visit her again.
Baby Acapulco,94,I ordered takeout for dinner and it was better than my expectations  BA has delicious Tex-Mex food  Customer service is also top notch  I highly recommend 
Baby Acapulco,95,Trey was so helpful and friendly  I had a strawberry banana Rita  which is the best time you can get off the secret menu  and a Helen s combo. I couldn t believe how personable the staff was  a lot has changed since I last came and I barely recognized anyone. But a location I already liked has improved even more. When I came about two weeks ago  the bartender was a blonde woman who was very sweet as well. The new bartenders are so attentive and they make the experience even better  I ll be back to see Trey
Baby Acapulco,96,Came here for lunch whilst our cars were getting their oil changed next door. One of my friends assured me that this was a good place to eat. I had never heard of the chain before. Service was good and friendly. Ambience was ok. There were numerous large flat screens  the trouble was that we went on the same day that some Jackass flew a plane into the IRS building in Austin. So naturally  that was all that was on TV.  They had numerous specials  unfortunately the one for that day was a hamburger. Really  A hamburger at a mexican restaurant   Thats like ordering a pizza at Red Lobster. I did go for their  2 Bud light special. Not my preference of beer  but definitely my preference of price.  They brought out warm delicious tortilla chips to start  with an incredible salsa. Typically salsas arent that spicy so they can appeal to the masses. This salsa had some kick though. It was actually the perfect amount of palate punt for my liking.   I ordered the Puffy Tacos  mainly because it sounded like a Mexican Rapper  so I had to see what it entailed. It was definitely interesting. I am big on texture  crispy crunchy being my favorite. These were definitely crispy  at least at first .   I ordered a chicken and a beef PT. They came with rice and beans. The beef was tastier than the chicken I thought. The chicken just seemed a little bland. The rice was good as well. The beans... Eh  I dont really go for waterry runny beans. So alas  I didnt try them due to me being weirded out.  For under  10  it was a good deal. I d probably try this place again  but I wouldnt go out of my way for them.
Baby Acapulco,97,I came in tonight with my girl and Sergio was a excellent server and he got everything I asked for... The jalape o ranch was great i love that stuff... Drinks were just what I needed... Thank you and we will be back
Baby Acapulco,98,Food here has really taken a dive the last few times I ve been here.  I ordered carne guisada plate this last time and food was room temperature when it s a restaurant.  Food should be hot as if it was just got taken out of the oven.   Sadly  I wasn t impressed with the lack of flavor.  I know a lot of people rave about coming to eat here.  Me  I wasn t impressed and will not be back.
Baby Acapulco,99,Omg    This place was fantastic    I moved here 8 months ago and tried Baby A s for the 1st time... The service was amazing and the food was fantastic..our server  Irvine was truly amazing... if you re ever in the area  try it... my aunt and loved it and will go back regularly 
Baby Acapulco,100,Stop here today for lunch. I usually eat at my own Mexican restaurant. Today traffic was horrible and my sugar levels had drop. As I walk in Baby A  I was greeted by Carolyn. Although they were pack she immediately could see I wasn t feeling well. Your server sat me down in your 1st front tables and rush me cool water. I ask  where s the ice  Fortunately for me she said  cool off 1st  Once I did she sat me down at another table bit more comfortable. I ask  what do you suggest  She said  the amorous tacos. I felt better and ask for a cocktail. Carolyn said  our frozen watermelon margarita. What a delicious combination   1st My deepest gratitude to a individual who could see a person in distress  EVEN When slammed  2nd Great customer service   3rd Knowledge on her company menu   LAST NOT LEAST  I will return to try the rest of your delicious looking menu  providing Carolyn is working   PS  I offered Carolyn a job employment with my establishment  she respectful said  thank you and  declined. You must treat your employees well...
Baby Acapulco,101,Had limited time for a quick lunch. Ms. Carolyn was my waitress. I ask for something fast and filling. She suggested Jerry s Burrito. It was off the chain  She had me in and out in no time  Thanks  Environment was cool. Didn t have opportunity for a cocktail. Ms. Carolyn suggested their purple margarita. I will definitely return and try it out soon  That and the beef fajitas. They look and smell awesome 
Baby Acapulco,102,The Superman Rita is great  Unfortunately the chips  served with the yummy salsa were stale.  Had the BabyAs platter  feeds two- shared the dish. The dish comes with a crunchy taco  chalupa  fajitas  carne guisada and rice and beans.  It was pretty good  carne guisada was a little weak tho  to much tomato. Would definitely come back for the Ritas 
Baby Acapulco,103,Food and drinks were better than the service today. The staff in the kitchen could be heard literally from downtown  they were so loud yelling laughing  a scream here and there. I get you sometimes want to enjoy time with coworkers but was the manager away today   Not enjoyable when the loud staff is interrupting your own conversation at your table.
Baby Acapulco,104,I just come here for the Purple Margarita...  I don t really care for their food  its not good and it comes out far too quickly to be fresh. I don t think I have had anything here that I really like. Their  famous soup  - I think I have had canned soup that was better.. BUT I go for the drinks and because it s right down the street and the bartender is always nice.. The shared 711 parking is very annoying  it s almost impossible to find a spot and they will tow you 
Baby Acapulco,105,I m pretty sure people come here exclusively for the purple margaritas and the chips.   The drinks were  for the record  on point. They don t tell you what s in the purple margs  but they re delicious  and I completely understand why they limit you to two. The food was very average  but the drinks made up for it. Also  the set up of the restaurant is bustling and not intimate at all. I see myself returning for appetizers and margs  but probably not dinner.
Baby Acapulco,106,I ve been here a few times. The food is good  not too outstanding. Not crowded at all on Sunday morning. I expected huge mexican families and people getting out of church and sxsw douchebags. But damn near none was there. Cool for me. Server Sergio was prompt  helpful and attentive. I ate the deluxe dinner. It was good. The chips are the unhealthy super salty kind  which I like. The salsa was runny and bland  which I don t like. Believe it or not  I ve never drank any booze here. Heard it s great though. Extra parking next door. The bathroom needs to be fixed up big time.
Baby Acapulco,107,I never really expect much from Baby Acapulco  at any of their locations   but jeez last nights service and food were just flat out terrible. It s 100  hit or miss on the food at any Baby A s location  but to not get our food for 50 minutes after ordering  and when it did come out  the plate had been sitting under the heat lamp for so long that the foil for the tortillas had turned brown and the lime and cilantro had cooked. Thats not even even mentioning not being able to speak to the waitress to order a drink because she was busy running all over the restaurant. It sucks ownership hasn t seemed to care for as long as they ve been in business  but you can certainly tell the clock is ticking for all Baby A s locations....
Baby Acapulco,108,Don t Eat here at all bad experience bad customer service and management place is disgusting seats are broken everything is nasty
Baby Acapulco,109,Just wanted to Thank Carolyn and Baby Acapulco for another great lunch with family on Friday. Always great food and impeccable service  We love Baby Acapulco 
Baby Acapulco,110,First off  I think that vacant lot  filled with piles of dirt  we parked in may get us towed. Since there was no parking available within a 100 miles radius  may or may not be exaggerating here  of this place  we took our chances. Upon entry on a Friday night  we had one of 2 options to seat ourselves  a table basically right in the entryway or one in the bar. We went for the latter since the real reason we were there was for happy hour.   Our server brings us 2 menus  even thought there are 4 of us . That s fine. We had one minor in our party. I ask the server if it would be possible to get him a virgin drink. She has to check with the bartender.When she eventually returns she says yes. Ok. Another member of our party has recently turned 21. She inquires as to what the blue margarita tastes like. The server says she doesn t know. Well...is there anyone else on the premises that may have knowledge as to how it tastes  She goes to check. Again  eventually she returns. So  She informs us that she asked the bartender and he said is tastes excellent. So blue tastes like excellent  She confirms  oblivious to the fact that she has in know way communicated to us  the taste of blue. Off she goes again. I tell all that I m am NOT getting a good vibe here AT ALL. We have a long discussion as to whether we should stick it out and  if not  where we will go instead. Fortunately  we were not interrupted in our discussion as our server never returned. Finally it was agreed. We bailed. Thankfully  we had not lasted long enough to find out whether we were in a tow zone or not.
Baby Acapulco,111,Sundays is the best days to come if you want outstanding service   Yes it is busy  but David makes sure he is still very attentive to his tables. EVERY visit we have had here when he s here we ALWAYS leave satisfied and happy with our visit. He s patient and he makes sure you have everything you need. So once again  Baby Acapulco Riverside location next to 7 11. We visit Sunday evenings. Ask for DAVID and I guarantee you will not regret it.   
Baby Acapulco,112,I went to Baby As on Riverside and Lakeshore Blvd.  The fajitas are off the hook.  Jessica the waitress was so welcoming and fun.  I ll make sure to come back soon.
Baby Acapulco,113,We had ordered both drinks and food. We understand that restaurants aren t supposed to be quiet  but tonight there was a table of 14 that was so loud we couldn t hear ourselves talk. We were literally yelling to be able to hear each other. We kindly requested to be switched tables to the other side of the restaurant so we could enjoy our meal  and we were told by the manager that we needed to hold on and that they were going to check on something. There were plenty of tables of three open for seating. There were clearly more than six tables open and they don t take reservations. The manager came back and said that he wasn t at liberty to discuss why  but he couldn t give us another table. The lack of customer service was ridiculous. A problem that could have easily been resolved  ended with us having to leave the restaurant.
Baby Acapulco,114,Baby A s is Baby A s... went for happy hour and  got the usual half price ambiance that comes with that  but our server Amber was great... and down to earth  Didn t pay too much for a couple drinks and munchies 
Baby Acapulco,115,I would give this place no stars if possible. Went there for Mother s Day the service was horrible. They tried to seat us at a table for four and there were six of us. While the two tables next to us sat empty I insisted they put them together to accommodate us. I ordered the Suissa enchiladas and got green chili. They insisted that they were what I had ordered. I did not argue but asked for sauce on the side they brought me sour cream instead of Suizza sauce. My daughters food never came out the waiter blamed the cook. Ordered margarita and a Michelada  got the margarita 30 minutes later Chilada never came. To top it all off the waiter acted like he was oblivious to the fact that he was given us horrible service. Every time he came to the table he would start with a joke. Nobody was laughing at our table. I know you guys are sort of an icon in Austin but get it together baby A s. You ruined my Mother s Day lunch.
Baby Acapulco,116,First time trying this restaurant  and was excited because of their infamous purple margaritas. Ordered enchiladas  the rice was hard and beans were ugly. The purple margarita  needless to say  didn t have a great taste but was strong. I prefer something I can enjoy instead of the taste of cheap vodka. The server didn t make things better  she would run off  ignore request and took forever to refill the waters. I would not recommended this place to anyone.
Baby Acapulco,117,Shout out to Martin and the exceptional service he provided at the Riverside location. He was prompt with his service  our drinks stayed full and we never had to wait for anything... Appreciate ya Martin  you will see us again 
Baby Acapulco,118,The food is meh but we only come here for two things  1. The best margaritas in town 2. For our amazing friday server  Carolyn. She is the best server there  Thank you so much for making our fridays a little easier 
Baby Acapulco,119,Waited over 30 minutes for a water after we asked two additional times. Then an employee in front of my girlfriend told the manager that we needed to have more patients.
Baby Acapulco,120,I m baffled by all the bad reviews. We met here for dinner last night and had a great time. Our server quickly brought our strawberry margaritas and chips  amp  salsa. I wasn t a big fan of the chips but the salsa has a great kick to it. Our server suggested several items from the menu. He was on point by suggesting the puffy taco  YUM YUM  and the tortilla soup. The taco was perfect and was topped with queso. The soup was a little bland  but was made with top quality chicken. Over all everything was good.   I would have given another star if the location wasn t so bad. They share a parking lot with 7-11 and parking is HORRIBLE.
Baby Acapulco,121,DISCLAIMER   I recently moved to Austin from Corpus Christi  where you can find some of the best Mexican food this side of the border.  Since my birthday  I have been on a quest to find delicious Mexican food in Austin.  It has not been going so well.  This was my worst experience thus far  and I will tell you exactly why.  I wandered in with a friend on Friday evening.  Immediately I was greeted by an armed police officer guarding the door.  What kind of place is this   They were playing  doin  it  music  R.Kelly  loud as hell  and I later realized that it was compliments of a jukebox near the bar.  My friend and I could hardly hear each other to talk.  So we were sat.  Then we continued to sit  and sit  and sit...aaaaaaannnd sit.  For 15 minutes we sat before the server came over to bring our chips and salsa and take our drink orders.  I ordered the Purple Rita  which my sister said was a must have.  Apparently they have a limit of 2 per guest  as they are supposedly strong as hell.  They were not  and at a cost of nearly  9 a pop   I ordered the beef crunchy tacos  as usual  because I find I can gauge the quality ranking of each restaurant by ordering the same thing at each one.  The taco shells tasted store-bought  which I HATE   and the beef was not seasoned well.  The refried beans were nothing to write home about.  I didn t even want to try the rice.      The most disappointing Mexican food experience in Austin  compounded by crappy service  lacking authentic ambiance  and weak drinks.  Not going back  on to the next 
Baby Acapulco,122,Visited for breakfast food at lunchtime on a Sunday and it was pleasant on the patio. Less than stellar chips. Good migas for breakfast. They also make good chicken tortilla soup. Well stocked tequila list. A great Herraduro Anejo Mexican Martini and they put the shaker on the table for me. We go more for the drinks than the food.   Now  where on earth in Fort Worth can I get a Mexican Martini  I can t find a place that knows how to do it right but I can think of five places in Austin that make kick ass ones. Not fair I tell you  not fair. I need help. I asked for one at Esparza s and people looked at me like I had four heads. I asked for one at Lupe s and it was this strange tequila on ice thing. NO ... you mix it like a margarita basically but without all ice in the glass. instead you shake it over ice and pour chilled into martini glass. Sigh. it s a thing of beauty.
Baby Acapulco,123,Last night I was saddened to learn that my favorite spot for tortilla soup and chips and salsa had decided to  unspice  their food.  It seems they have taken the Mex out of their TexMex.  Their salsa was unusually bland and seemingly un-jalapeno-y.  I thought it was just a bad batch of salsa. Then I ordered what used to be my favorite tortilla soup in Austin.  What a sad experience   If you like water with pieces of chicken floating around and a very bland taste - this is the soup for you.  Needless to say  I didn t bring the leftovers home to enjoy for lunch.  I m not sure if this store is boycotting the jalapeno but I think I will be boycotting them.  There are just too many Mexican Texmex food restaurants in this city     Their menu did boast of lowered prices.  I wonder if the jalapeno s got cut in that corner 
Baby Acapulco,124,This was my first visit to this location. Service provided by Fabian was outstanding. He anticipated all my needs and made some great recommendations. I will definitely be back 
Baby Acapulco,125,If you like to eat greasy  lard-filled Tex-Mex food in a dirty place that smells like a bar then you ll be right at home at Baby Acapulco.  The menus are dirty and coated in grease  and the vinyl table cloths covered with pen marks and who knows what.  All of the beans and rice contain lard or chicken broth  so there is nothing for vegetarians but chips  salsa and maybe the cheese quesadilla.    Do yourself a favor and walk over to Shady Grove or Austin Java instead  you ll have a much nicer meal.
Baby Acapulco,126,This isn t the best Mexican food you can get in Austin but it s still good  The interior reminded me of Carlos O Kelly s  generic Mexican restaurant   a bit weird but fun. Got the famous Purple-Rita and it s the real deal. There are a few  only 2 per customer  drinks in Austin but none have hit me quite as fast as the Purple-Rita. Overall worth going to get the drink at the very least.
Baby Acapulco,127,I am still unsure of what to think of this Baby A s. I met a friend for dinner here one night. This was my first time going. As a north sider I rarely drive South much less the Eastside of Austin.  I was very frustrated from the beginning with the parking situation or lack of parking. I ended up parking in some sort of lot behind the restaurant that was super sketchy and frightening.  My friend already had a table for us but it took awhile for the waitress to come take our order  bring us our drinks  and our check.  Be warned that the restroom is dirty so I hope you don t have to go. I couldn t bring myself to even use it.  My food was good though. I had a martini and the cowboy enchilada and I would recommend them.   I honestly do not want to go back to this location ever again. Park and dine at your own risk.
Baby Acapulco,128,So  this was my first time at Baby A s and I went for happy hour with my colleagues. Our waitress was lovely  however  the manager was a total Jeri and the opposite of accomodating. When I arrived my group consisted of about 8 people  and we mentioned we d probably have about 5 more. The snippy and stressed out manager  James  acted like we weren t 25 per cent of the people in the joint  which was half empty  and demanded we name exactly the number of people we expected. When I pointed out that it was hard to tell at happy hour  and exclaimed that if we wanted another table we must ensure we knew exactly how many were coming. In general  this manager was totally inhospitable and a huge turnoff for this place.
Baby Acapulco,129,The service was horrible. I can t believe they had the nerve to also serve such awful drinks. They get a star for being the only good smelling Baby A s in Austin.
Baby Acapulco,130,This is an almost-neighborhood place that has been there for awhile. I tell my friends that the drinks are terrific  the food is ok  but the food is not why you d really go there. I ve been a fan for ten years. Bathrooms not clean. Just go in knowing what to expect and you might love it 
Baby Acapulco,131,I came here for lunch after work with my roommate and one of our friends.  All I can really say for it   It wasn t THAT bad.  The food was pretty good.  I m a ridiculously picky eater  so of course I spent my entire dining experience picking out the onions the way a 5-year-old would.  None the less  it still tasted pretty awesome.  But our server- I could tell he was pretty new.  He was EXTREMELY nice  and attentive so I have to give him props for that.  But he had to return to our table up to about six times to ask us additional questions about our order.  And refills came pretty scarcely- and all we had was water.    I d be happy to eat here again.  But it s not going to be my  1 choice... ever.
Baby Acapulco,132,Had an okay experience with friends on a late night. Server was enthusiastic but the food was a little disappointing. Will not hurry back.
Baby Acapulco,133,Not fancy but they have good food  amp  friendly employees. I have gone 2 sundays in a row   Fish tacos  amp  Baby changa are pretty good 
Baby Acapulco,134,Food is acceptable. Although an Austin staple  Baby A s represents a basic outlook on Tex Mex. Go for the  Purple Rita   a tasty margarita that will engulf your alcohol tolerance.
Baby Acapulco,135,Love the purple margaritas  The food could be better  and more clearly marked for vegetarian items  hello  this is Austin  ... however  I ordered the veggie fajitas with black beans and no dairy... and ate every bite of my huge portion.
Baby Acapulco,136,Food is what you would expect at a place people go to drink.  Go for Cocktails-they rock and will rock you.  Drinks are strong...my favorite-the cantelope margarita-pretty sure that is an everclear after-taste.  Get food only if you need a snack.
Baby Acapulco,137,When your hung over and craving queso this is a pretty neat spot being so close to home  Fun happy hour environment  Loud music and margaritas  
Baby Acapulco,138,I really hate giving crappy reviews but this is one dining experience that earned it.  One of the worst dining experiences ever.  The food was awful.  There was no flavor in anything.  We were a party of 6 and they won t split a check for parties of 5 or more.  No problem there  but at least be helpful in helping us break bills and figure out the check.  There were no refills on anyone s drinks.  I guess the only positive is that the chips were served hot.  The bathrooms were disgustingly filthy and small.  The parking lot is very small.    Eat and drink at your own risk.
Baby Acapulco,139,On a birthday excursion  we headed here as it s walking distance from my townhouse.   I m new to Austin but I ve heard legendary things about the  purple margarita  so I tried it. We had been drinking for a bit so we needed munchies and I m so glad we only had the queso. Talk about fully processed.   The prices on the food are WAY too high for the quality of what they serve. If you want good  inexpensive Mexican  go to Taco Cabana down the street. But the drink was strong  as I was warned  and I may find myself there every once in a while--only to drink.
Baby Acapulco,140,My experience here was a total disappointment.  Mexican food should be fresh and hot.  The food was not spicy and the presentation was terrible.  The server was not interested in all in asking how the food was  even though I was missing part of my order and had to flag him down.  This is a restaurant that I would not return to.
Baby Acapulco,141,Wow HOW SAD  Baby A s use to be my second home  you could find me there just about every day. I had not been to this Baby A s in a long time and decided to re kindle my tex mex romance  BOY was I disappointed.  I had the Mexican Martini  yuk  and the queso compuesto  I could have gone to the corner ice house to get better  so sad.  Well at least I have good memories of what it use to be.
Baby Acapulco,142,I went here with my mother the first time. Food was good service was terrible. Then went back today with some friends and service was a little better. 3 stars is all I can give them.
Baby Acapulco,143,I don t understand all the bad reviews.....I had a great visit.  The chips were hot and the salsa was delicious   Our waiter was very nice and attentive  but didn t hover .  The food was great and the bathrooms were spotless - they could use some updating  but were very  very clean.  The parking situation is horrible  but for the price  Baby Acapulo s is a great choice 
Baby Acapulco,144,The waiter was rude   he took a long time to attend to us    ordered wings and I got sick the nxt day   others weren t allowed  when it wasn t even closed yet..and others inside were still getting service..terrible experience with them..
Baby Acapulco,145,For a Mexican Restaurant attached to a 7-11 the food is surprisingly wonderful. Puffy tacos are a must.
Baby Acapulco,146,Horrible service      I can t believe that I cannot get a cup of water and tortilla soup in less than an hour    Then wait another 20 minutes to get my check and another 10 to get my card back...
Baby Acapulco,147,I love Baby A s. Awesome fajita s and love the purple margaritas. But this location can do a lot better. Been here twice and will not return to this location due to the lack of cleanliness. Clean up your location. Guests should not have to sit in dirty booths  have dirty dishes  or sit next to open trash cans.
Baby Acapulco,148,The purple drank  Is amaZing  Limit is 2 but my BFF ordered and extra one and I go you done  Them fajitas are panty droppers as in drop them good  Joanna the server WAS AMzing 
Baby Acapulco,149,I love the food and their drinks are the vast. Its the parking or lack of that is horrible. Some items can be pricey but the menu is generally decently priced.
Baby Acapulco,150,I lived across the street from Baby A s for several months before I decided to try their food out. I have grown up sampling a variety of Mexican Tex-Mex food at different quality levels  so I had an idea of what I might expect for the prices. I was sorely disappointed regardless.  The food was mediocre  though at least cooked and warm. Unfortunately  when nothing is inherently  wrong  with the order  that means the poor quality is supposed to be what you re paying for.  The restaurant itself was dirty and run down  heck  it shares a lot with a 7-11 and a drive-thru post office. No complaints about service  but that s really the only thing you couldn t complain about here.  All in all  I d recommend finding somewhere else to eat. There are places just as cheap that serve better tasting food elsewhere in Austin.
Baby Acapulco,151,I was so disappointed by them at riverside location I order seafood enchiladas it was so over season I couldn t eat it I just eat some of my husband food ever with that it didn t taste good. I like the other location better that was my thrid time eating at Mexican restaurant and worst.
Baby Acapulco,152,I love the other Baby A s locations.  This particular  Baby As is disgusting. I ordered Togo so I didn t know what I was getting myself into with this location. Bad idea I expected it to be as clean and nice as the other locations BUT NO WAY  AVOID THIS LOCATION FOR YOU OWN SAFETY  it was around 8 30 pm on Sunday I literally had to step over to dirty looking stinking homeless people passed out right on the sidewalk in front of the only entrance both had multiple empty four Loco malt liqueur cans around them on the ground around them. I walk inside the floor and walls are dirty. It smells like vomit. Then I walk up to the bar and they guy that took my order on the phone  which acted like he didn t know anything about mexican food while I was trying to order.  Well he strolls up I mistook him at first as one of the hobos out front but no he works there. He looked like a mechanic he was all dirty and had some type of black shit all over his hands and under his nails. He was cocky like he was George Clooney or something. After waiting 15 min for my food after it was already called in 20 min before that. Then the order was wrong when I finally got back to eat. I had one bite and tossed I couldn t get the image of how dirty the place was and that guy that slithered up to the bar that gave me the food. Bad location. I love all the other Baby A s and love there drinks AT EVERY OTHER LOCATION.  DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION YOU WILL REGRET IT.
Baby Acapulco,153,Food was meh...Rita s were ok...server was actually pretty good. I would say this is a great spot to bring a date you really could give two sh ts about and u just wanna get wasted on grain alcohol margaritas...a place like this would be great if there weren t so many amazing Mexican and TexMex joints in Austin....
Baby Acapulco,154,Bad drinks  bad service. Drinks were extremely bitter  they will not exchange  allowed me to.have 2 drinks with my meal    Asked for a 3rd and was refused  I had zero alcohol before coming to the restaurant. I will never come back here.
Baby Acapulco,155,Definitely a great deal for the price... They could ve added a little more salt to the margaritas  but that depends on the bartender... Overall it s a solid 3  great little place to eat. If you come out here and sit outside near the wood railings  don t forget to leave a chip for our furry little friends  they will come right up and take it  ain t no shame in their game 
Baby Acapulco,156,Baby A s Riverside Drive Lakeshor. Let s  s get that right   anyhow sitting here with a bartender named Blake   long haired college kid  surfer dude  makes awesome drinks.  if you come here make sure you come here on Blake s shift  excellent service personable intelligent sweet.  Ask for Blake he s a wonderful server. thank you for your service
Baby Acapulco,157,Great mexican food.  But who cares lets get the purple margerita.
Baby Acapulco,158,Me and my wife have been coming here for a long time. This place always greets you with a smile and has excellent service. The food is top notch tex mex  the margaritas are some of the best in Texas. The parking lot is a little small and can be an issue during peak hours  but patience always prevails. Check it out  you will love it.
Baby Acapulco,159,Baby A s is good to be social and to get a quick drink especially if you want their Purple Margarita. The food is the average Mexican food but there hasn t been a plate they have that has made its signature for me. The biggest thing I hate about this location is the parking. There is very very little of it. First come fist serve.
Baby Acapulco,160,While the tortilla soup was delicious and with a kick  was not very substantial and the puffy taco that came with it was greasy and unedible.  I hear their purple ritas are some of the best drinks in Austin so I may go back to give them a try but I would eat somewhere else.
Baby Acapulco,161,I am disappointed in this location.  It has really gone down hill.  Parking is limited the furniture is old and the bathrooms are not clean.  The waiter acted as if we were bothering him when he came to our table.  He continued to act bothered when he came to our table and we ordered drinks and food.  I am not sure what was his deal.
Baby Acapulco,162,today was the last day that they ll be seeing me  at this location anyway.  i don t know if it s every server there or if we get the same guy over and over and over and over and.. you get the idea.  i ll start with my gripes - i ordered the puffy tacos  which were stale.  we had to ask twice for napkins and salsa and our teas reached the bottom without ever getting refilled.  this is my kind of experience every time i go to this location.  another thing - they charged me  1.75 for 4 avocado slices  about a quarter of an avocado .. avocado s at the store cost ONE DOLLAR.  that s just ridiculous. oh yeah  and the parking sucks   you get half a parking lot shared with the 7eleven next door  whom enforces towing  and a shady parking lot behind the restaurant that belongs to some rinky-dink mail place.  however  i will give credit where credit is due  the queso compuesto is always amazing  and we can t forget about their purple ritas.  the chipotle chicken is also yummy and the cowboy enchiladas are creative and really good.
Baby Acapulco,163,The chicken fajitas and carne guisada are nasty  The service is very poor   James is a horrible  manager   Me  my two year old son  and mother were treated very poorly here today by a very unprofessional  manager  named James. I ve been to many baby a s and have never been treated this way I don t know how this man still works here... I brought my son here since he had never ate at Baby A s before  I wanted him to get the experience I did there as a kid. When we sat down a very nice Mexican brought us chips  salsa  and menus then our waitress finally came over to get our drink and appetizer order. When she brings everything back I asked her for more chips. She brings us more chips but they re cold so I asked her to bring us fresh ones because those were cold and the ones the nice Mexican brought were warm like there suppose to be. I didn t even get the waitress name she was a Caucasian young female with black hair she didn t have very good customer service skills. By this time my mother already needed a refill and the waitress still hadn t brought our warm chips out. She finally comes 15 minutes later with our food  I notice after she walked away that she forgot my corn tortillas. So I walked up to where she was and asked her for corn tortillas. When I returned to my seat I had noticed she still carried on talking with the other waitress. She stayed there talking so I asked for a manager  he then comes over and isn t very polite at all. I tell him I asked our waitress for corn tortillas and instead of going to get them right away so my food doesn t get cold she carried on talking with another waitress until she had seen that I called you. She then walks up with the corn tortillas so then he goes oh here problem solved. I ignored his rudeness. I finally fix my taco to take a bite and it s nasty  cold  and dry. The corn tortillas were hot but the chicken fajitas were nasty  My mother ordered carne guisada and the meat was just fat it was so nasty  So then my mom calls our waitress over to tell her we aren t pleased with the food we don t want it. The waitress goes to tell the manager  the manager comes to us and says well you re going to have to pay for something and we said well sir we didn t eat anything the queso got cold and hard from waiting right here for chips  the food is nasty  he then says  well you took a bite  I replied  I took a bite because I planned on eating my tacos but then I figured out it was nasty by taking that bite  I wouldn t be complaining if it wasn t nasty but I m not going to make myself eat something I don t like  that s why I came to a restaurant to order something that I do like.  I start gathering my son s stuff up to leave and the  manager  James is still raising his voice and getting my son worried  shouting he s going to call the police if we don t pay for at least our drinks I said sir you ve been so rude to us what makes you think I want to spend a dime here he says DON T EVER COME BACK HERE very loudly  I replied I wont  so I take my son to my vehicle to leave because the way he treated us  he was so unprofessional made me and my family feel so low I have never been treated this way in my life  I thought my mom followed but my mom stayed in the building because he continued to argue with her and tell her he was going to call the cops and that he can talk to her however he wants because she is a nobody to him and he doesn t have to watch his language. She then paid him  15 for our drinks and queso which I thought she shouldn t have paid because the way he treated her. He made my mother cry  that hurt to see that. This guy needs to be fired. The experience we all got today made me feel like this guy was racist he was a Caucasian male and we were the only Mexicans in that section at the time. He does not know how to manage a business  he wanted to fight and argue rather than solve our problem. More training needs to be done before hiring.
Baby Acapulco,164,I hadn t been to the Riverside location in a very long time. To say the least we had the best experience we ever had at any of the Baby A s locations. We were waited on by Bonnie who gave us great service but who was also very entertaining. I love when you have a server that  anticipates your needs rather than waiting for you to ask. Bonnie was fast  friendly  and fun. The food was perfect and the drinks were delicious. I will definitely be making this location my regular location.
Baby Acapulco,165,As far as Tex Mex places go this just isn t up to par. Why would I spend the same amount of money here that I would at just about any other Tex Mex restaurant and eat MUCH higher quality food. I love the location and the staff is quite friendly but I can t ignore how poor the food quality is here. The puffy tacos would be great if the ingredients tasted better 
Baby Acapulco,166,I m a huge fan of dirty hole in the wall Mexican restaurants where you get tons of food of dubious quality but even this is pushing the limits of what I can take.  The restaurant is filthy and the food is not in much better shape.
Baby Acapulco,167,New item on the menu  stuffed avocado....Amazing. Good service  good value  
Baby Acapulco,168,I visited this Baby A s on Wednesday  May 11  2011   10 00pm with a friend who is visiting from out of town.  When we sat down at the bar  we were  greeted  by the bartender with a   Can I help you    I asked for some menus and he literally slid them down the bar to us.  We ordered some food to go  and after ordering  we went outside to smoke a cigarette.  The bartender accompanied by his manager followed us outside asking us where we were going while the manager wrote down our license plate number    We hadn t even received our food yet    On top of the incredibly rude way we were treated  the food was gross and the margarita tasted dirty.  I should have listened to everyone who told me to never go to the Baby A s on Riverside   
Baby Acapulco,169,The food and drinks are great  but the service is soooooo slow  Not sure where our waiter kept disappearing to  but wow. We had the new Mix grill  fajita beef and chicken  shrimp  bacon  pork  and jalape o sausage. It was fantastic.
Baby Acapulco,170,Visited this Baby A s on July 17th.  It was the worst service ever.  Our waitress was taking our drink order  amp  we were disappointed when she told us they didn t have any soda - only tea  water or margaritas.  My MIL  amp  I decided to have a margaritas.   I ordered the blue Margarita.  It was the most disgusting drink I ve ever had.  The manager came by to see if everything was ok  and I asked her if I could have a different margarita because the one I ordered was terrible.   She said they were all made frome same base  premade .  So I said I d have a tea then.  Then I was told by the Mgr  you understand we can t take this drink off the bill  right   I said you can t take it off even though I m telling you it s terrible   She said yes.  So I said I ll just drink water.  I ve never been to any restaurant where if I had a problem with something I ordered that they wouldn t credit the bill.  That s called taking care of your customers. Then we waited 30 more minutes before they came and took our order.  Ridiculous   Besides our visit starting off this way  it took them an hour to get our food . . . for tacos    I mean  it was ridiculous   Lesson learned . . . We will never visit this restaurant again.
Baby Acapulco,171,Ordered a simple Martini.  I get like 7   All in one pouring thing.  Love this place.
Baby Acapulco,172,Not a good experience   Baby A s on Lakeshore near Riverside. We went to go pick up the soup. It smelled funny and when I opened the lid I saw a hair in it. Soup went right into the drain. Tortilla Soup  10. Not eating it priceless.
Baby Acapulco,173,seriously the new happy hour rocks         5  mexican martinis everyday from 2-7. and half price some appetizers. that s what s up. i ll be going there everyday.
Baby Acapulco,174,I went in for takeout on my way to work and ordered the Chicken Taco Plate.  Simple enough. WRONG    When I got to work with my food  just 5 minutes away  the taco shells were stale and 2 of the tacos were soggy and fell apart. the chicken in the tacos were awfully bland and cold. the rice was clumply and cold  and the refried beans   I think they were refried beans anyway were no beans and all soupy. Pathetic.I am going back to inform the manager about this and to see what the reaction will be. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
Baby Acapulco,175,The only reason I am giving this particular Baby Acapulco location one star is due to the HORRIBLE service we got.  It was Wednesday night after 8 and it was NOT busy in there at all.  Our waiter was a very arrogant  cocky dick.  He got my friend s order wrong.  She is a vegetarian and ordered cheese enchiladas.  When he brought her plate out he said   Beef enchiladas  and she said that was not correct  she ordered cheese.  The jerk waiter stood there and argued with my friend saying she said beef.  I intervened and said   Uhm  no.  I think a vegetarian knows that she did not order beef.   The waiter refused to admit he was WRONG and refused to correct his mistake.  I told him that if he didn t return the plate and bring my friend what she ordered  then we were leaving.  The dick still refused.  So we got up and left.  I bet he was forced to admit his mistake to his boss then  hmmmm   We went to Taco Bell instead.  They got my friend s bean burrito order correct on the 1st try   Imagine that 
Baby Acapulco,176,My husband  amp  I have truly enjoyed the drinks  amp  atmosphere at Baby A s for years. We even have one close to us up in North Austin. However  this week we stopped at the Baby A s off of Riverside  the one next to the convenience store  not sure if this is the same location   amp  it was the worst experience ever  As we walked through the door  the hostess tells us that we can sit ourselves down in the dining area that was open for customers  the other side was closed . So we walked into the room she POINTED us to from behind her little podium and we found one open table. We sat down and waited a few minutes to see if we would be approached by a waitress and eventually grabbed our own menus to browse through. However  a few minutes later we were approached by a waitress who told us that the table was reserved and that we needed to move to another table. Of course  there was no sign on the table indicating that it was reserved. My husband points this out to the waitress who then tells us that we can sit at any other table in the room. My husband explains that there are no other tables. The waitress  apparantly thinking we had missed a table  tells us to follow her and that she would find us a table   but she realizes that there are no other tables. She then walks us back to the entrance of the restaurant  amp  walks off to approach  amp  hug  a man sitting at a table near the kitchen entrance having dinner. Without a word to us. We follow the waitress thinking she has found us a table  again  this is not a very big place so it was pretty obvious that we were either going to be seated with this man she was speaking to or at the tables bunched up against the wall looking as if they were meant to be stored   but according to the name tag on the man s shirt  this man--Juan was the manager of the restuarant  amp  the waitress was asking him if we could sit at the table we had just been seated at even if it was reserved. My husband  who by this point is irritated with the disorganization  asks if the waitress is going to sit us with the man she is speaking to since she did say that she would find us a table. The manager of course  between bites  tells us that we cannot sit with him  but we can  sit over there  as he points to the tables  amp  chairs that are pushed up against the wall. We asked the manager  who continued with his meal  if he really wanted us to sit where he was directing us to and he confirmed that that was the only table he could offer us. Never mind that there was an entire section of the restaurant that was closed off and empty. My husband with much courtesy shook  the manager s hand and told him that  it had been very nice to meet him and that we would return to his restaurant when they got their st together.  The manager never got up from his seat nor did he stop his dining to make certain that the issue was resolved to our  the customer s   comfort. Like I said  we like the drinks at Baby A s  but we had not realized just how disorganized and run down that particular location had gotten. We had not been to that location in years and we most likely will stick to the locations up North off of Stonelake  amp  closer to Pflugerville. We ended up going to Joe s Crab Shack on the other side of Riverside where the ambiance  service  food  amp  drinks  were great.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,1,Ol   Among other Mexican restaurants in the area where I live this one always serve me well with great food and drinks.  I mostly have lunch here and tend to try different items from the menu. I had chicken tacos.  The tacos were plentiful and tasted great  and had nice flavor. It was plenty to eat where came with rice and beans.   This place is large where has a variety of places to sit like in the regular dining area  bar or outside facing the playground.  And yes they do have a big playground for kids.  I have seen many moms other together sipping on margaritas while their kids play.   It all tasted freshly made where walking to the bar can see a lady making fresh tortillas.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,2,Met some friends here for breakfast around 11 on a Saturday. The service was fine  mimosas good  who doesn t love a maraschino cherry in their mimo    and the chorizo plate was good enough  I d come back here. Maybe not during a Saturday when there s a UT game -- people were here to watch sports and it was V loud.  Not hating on football  just didn t peg this spot to be such a sports bar 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,3,Great chips  rice  and beans. Guava margarita was strong and delicious  and the flour tortillas are very fresh. Pictured is the Carne Roja en Guajillo - SUPER tender with the right amount of kick. 4 stars because the crispy taco and guacamole salad was the best version of a Taco Bell taco with a side of guac on top of lettuce  tomato  and cheese.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,4,Me and my family came here a few weeks ago and I was blown away by their great service and delicious food  I had the Chicken Enchiladas and they were so good  They have a big playground for the kids and delicious margaritas for the adults  Definitely adding to my list of go-to for Friday nights with the family 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,5,Great food and great service  We we re seating indoors per our request and had our waiter serve us within 5 minutes. Drinks were spot on....and our food was temperature hot and amazing good. I had the Poblano Enchiladas and my Chicken Caliente which was amazing as well.  No pics we were so hungry that we devoured our meal when I realized I didn t take any pics. Also the chips and salsa where fresh hot and spicy.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,6,Service was great  Food was the worst I ve eaten in a long time. Ambiance was relaxing.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,7,Living close by and having a toddler  Flores is one of my go-tos. Flores isn t the top of the line  but it has a lot going for it   The playground is the reason this place is packed with families and has long wait times on weekend nights. Huge  entirely fenced-in playground  space to run around  and plenty of outdoor tables where you can actually watch your kids play.    Service can be hit or miss  especially if they re busy. On the bright side  the drinks seem to have gotten stronger. This is the place where I always stick with what I know -- the carnitas plate. You can t go wrong.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,8,I Ordered two poblano enchiladas plates.  It was supposed be poblano peppers tomatoes onions verde sauce.  Instead I had chicken enchiladas with some poblanos.  All I could taste was chicken.  I let the restaurant know and as of today I have not heard a word from them.  I guess they don t care that my order was screwed up.  Also the receipt they gave was not mine.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,9,Hold my purse one second while I tell you about this place... My personal favorite Tex mex in all of Austin. I used to live dangerously close to this particular restaurant. From the drinks  salsa  and every single menu item they have. They know what they re doing and they do it very well  It is slightly more expensive than other spots. I don t know how you live your life. I just personally know you get what you pay for.  Get the guac with the pepitas in it. You re welcome   Ima need that purse back because this place costs Mama some cash.... 100 percent worth it
Flores Mexican Restaurant,10,Good  walked in  amp  got a table right away Bad  young hostess was not friendly at all  amp  didn t say hello - wasn t nice or rude - she looked like she hated her life or her job Good  drinks were served immediately  Bad  horrible tasting Mexican martini  amp  frozen margarita - they both tasted like sippy cup lime juice - absolutely awful  Good  silverware wrapped in a sturdy napkin Bad  one of the utensils was dirty Good  good came out super fast Bad  all three dishes had no flavor - we poured on the salt like it was popular   I haven t been here since the early 2010  amp  now I recall why.   PS  don t go here on a date  Super loud  Way too many kids running all over the place.  The only reason why I gave 2 stars is because our server was the best  amp  she deserved that 2nd star.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,11,Huge restaurant with a playground at the back for kids to play. Great service and huge portion sizes. The menu had so much variety  it was hard to decide what to order. We ended up ordering the choose 3 enchiladas with enchiladas poblano  spicy chicken  and shrimp. Also ordered the chicken fajitas. Presentation of the dishes was messy and the food was mediocre. The fajita chicken was cold and didn t taste fresh. The tortillas were a bit hard and the enchiladas weren t very flavorful.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,12,Look.  7ish years ago we went here.  There was a peice of glass in my husband s refried beans.  They offered us a complimentary sopapilla.  We went back today for a to-go order  My husband ordered the red pork.  It was FIRE.  And that wasn t even the worst part...apart from the heat  it was disgusting.  I don t know who okay d that one on the menu  but... it was a bad idea poorly executed.  The charro beans had all heat and no flavor and the rice tasted like nothing.  The one thing in my order I actually enjoyed was the margarita... too bad it set me back FIFTEEN DOLLARS for a basic frozen sangria margarita.  The yumminess is the only reason this place gets two stars...the minimum is 1 as zero is not an option. So you should really think of it as food...zero stars and drink 1.   Not impressed.  But who am I  the place had no parking spots so either this area of Austin has zero expectations or they must have something going for them I just don t know what it is.  Probably the alcohol.  And the playground.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,13,I ve eaten here a few times and there are things on the menu that are spot on great and then there are others that should just flat out be removed from the menu. The fajitas are amazing especially with their margaritas and a big bowl of tortilla chips and salsa. The thing I would warn everyone to stay away from is the chili relleno plate. It s tough  bland and has an odd smell to it. It s the one thing on the menu that I would advise everyone to stay away from.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,14,First time coming to this restaurant and I can honestly say I will be returning. Great environment to come with kids. Food is incredible very authentic Mexican food. Drinks are also on point 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,15,Friday night  quoted 30-35 wait  waited 50min. Sat and ordered immediately and waited 45 min for food. Then it came out with the wrong items  waiter had the items correct  kitchen messed up . Won t be returning.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,16,Flores is classic Tex-Mex comfort food. Nothing authentic or fancy about this place  but if you want to skip all the waiting and peacocking that comes with some of the more famous joints in town  and just eat some classic good old Tex-Mex this is your neighborhood joint.   It s not date night. It s not take the out-of-towners here to show off.   It s Tuesday night  I don t wanna cook  let s get Flores. It s I dunno  nothing sounds good  where can we trust to just seat us quickly  have good service   and a good meal.   It s eating your mom s go to dish that you love vs eating her fanciest holiday meal. It s not gonna blow your mind  but it s exactly what you want on a random night where you just wanna eat some comforting food.   I usually just get cheese enchiladas with queso  because if you want Tex-Mex why wouldn t you get the  Gringo Plate   but they have a lot of other good options too  especially they re surprisingly awesome Caldo de Pollo  which is probably they best thing in the menu.   I wish their guacamole was better. That s the only thing.   Also  in the spirit of being a solid neighborhood joint for the locals  they have a huge outdoor area with a playground  so the kids can roam while the parents have a margarita or two.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,17,After 10 years  after many special birthday celebrations for my daughter  I must say I am extremely disappointed  Angel  the manager  was very unprofessional and does not understand accommodations well. It could be he is unsure how to handle different situations. No respect to my family  who are all local  whatsoever. We felt uninvited  rushed  and as if we were a burden to  his customers.  Apparently  we were not customers for him. In a sense it was almost as if we were being discriminated against. I attempted to deal with this by contacting them directly but that did nothing. Due to this unfortunate event  I no longer support Flores Restaurant  which for me  it has cancelled my tradition for my daughter. Famous words from his mouth   it wouldn t be the first time I turned people away. 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,18,Great place for parents and kids. A great way to spend our friday night. They have a full bar and a variety of mexican food. My favorite was the queso and the soup. They have several different kinds of queso with meat with out and a spicy one. The floresita drink was so good also a calorie friendly one is the dirty water.  Salsa tasted homemade and chips are thin and crispy
Flores Mexican Restaurant,19,Came here for lunch with the kids. This place hasn t recovered since the last time we were here about a year ago.  They have an old  mask required sign on the door. I was worried at first  thinking we would need masks. However  all the employees weren t wearing any  so we were fine. Also  there was another sign that mentioned an avocado shortage... From the ban.... That was lifted 2 1 2 months ago. Another sign mentioning that their health score is available upon request  no ratings posted. All these signs at the entrance before we were seating. Everything just went downhill from there. On a positive note  after this low point  lunch. Things can only improve for the rest of our day. Onward and upward  Never to go backwards.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,20,Where to begin... The queso completas or however it is spelled was extremely watery so we got off to a bad start from the get go. I myself ordered the fish tacos and they were hands down the worst I ve ever had. No flavor seasoning wise but they did have a terrible aftertaste. The sauce for them was pitiful and bland and the limes that came with it were brown around the edges. Very off putting. My mother s nachos looked like they died in the window 10 minutes before they were brought out and my father s tacos were so greasy that he couldn t even finish one of them. Very disappointing time.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,21,I got the stuffed avocado. Really really good.  My only complaint is when I asked for a high chair for my 10 month old they brought me a nasty high chair. I had to bring it to the front for a new one and when I asked if they had something I could wipe the chair down with the lady seemed aggravated to do something  I offered to do  but that should have already been done. Then no one offered to carry it to my table I had to and I have a tear in a ligament in my shoulder. We are on vacation and forgot her high chair cover.  Also the lady next to us would not stop talking about abortions in front of my child. I know that s not the restaurant s fault but I feel if the waiter came to the table more the 3x I would have asked to move.  But food was good and so was the salsa which says a lot because I m very picky on salsa since I make my own
Flores Mexican Restaurant,22,Wow. Well I can say that I had quite a night  really for the books. My daughter just put down her dog  so best girlfriend and I decided to get the honking frozen daiquiri at the once thought snazzy Flores Mexican Restaurant  family friendly place . There were potholes in every single parking spot  so we had to park in the middle of William cannon. After about 20 minutes we made it across and the host lost our reservation. To accommodate us  they kindly and promptly seated us in the freezer  with two boxes of frozen cheese. The hostess gave us a box of cigarettes and two spare matches. I think that time went by quickly in the dark because the next thing I know  a meal prep cook said they were about to open and it was the next morning. I need to take my medication
Flores Mexican Restaurant,23,Drinks were expensive and not great at all. Food was mediocre at best. Worth sacrificing it for the playground so our kids could play but definitely wouldn t come here without kids. The wait staff was slow and not helpful when it came to choosing drinks or foods. If you work at a restaurant  you should know the menu and be able to recommend dishes or drinks to make your restaurant more money. Our waiter often said  i don t know  and was not familiar with the drink menu so we ended up not even ordering a drink. Margaritas were  12 bucks and for top shelf they were flavorless  and alcohol-less .   Was hopeful reviews were going to be wrong before coming but.. they were not.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,24,Skip this place. Ended up here because a similar Tex-mex restaurant had an hour long wait. I now know why the other restaurant had a wait and Flores didn t. Filthy restaurant  terrible food and on top of that  it smelt like piss.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,25,It was a beautiful Saturday morning when my friend and I decided to end the doom of waiting to be seated at a neaby overhyped breakfast joint. What a refreshing surprise to walk in  receive a friendly greeting  and be seated right away. Are you still serving breakfast we asked  Absolutely  was our server David s response. My friend ordered huevos rancheros with an outstanding spicy ranchero sauce- verified it s serranos in there. I did the veggie omelette with queso blanco. We were not disappointed. Big healthy amounts on our plates with wonderfully toasted potatoes  beans  and fresh corn tortillas. Very tasty and at our server s recommendation I tried the Mexican Irish Coffee  and it was definitely the perfect addition to my meal. David was a cheerful person and we learned he had just moved to town from Big D. I encouraged him to continue his great people skills and he was appreciative of the compliment. In all the time we spent at breakfast I had not even noticed that I still had not been contacted for seating at the other establishment. Just goes to show you that happiness and goodness are not always found at the hipster joints. For decent down-home cooking like mama used to make  head on over to Flores South Austin.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,26,LOVED our daytime lunch date at Flores  I can t believe I was born  amp  raised in Austin and this is my first time here  The margaritas are nice  amp  strong  quite delicious too  Steak fajita nachos and our cheese enchiladas were so tasty  The salsa was very very good  We re definitely coming back   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,27,The flour tortillas are a bit different. Service can sometimes be extremely slow. However  the quality of food is fair
Flores Mexican Restaurant,28,We tried this restaurant because their outdoor playscape looked fun for my kids. We sat outside and noticed two little girls staring at the 1 foot black plastic barrier around the playscape  near our table. As I walked my kids to the play area the girls point out that hundreds of ants are COVERING the barrier and they were bit by ants  great . I asked the gentleman spraying tables to please spray the plastic barrier to protect the kids and I let our server know because the ants were still there after my first request. I also noticed ant piles in other areas of the playground.   The food was good  minus the hair that was attached to the jalape o popper on the appetizer sampler. We then had to ask another server to call our server because we seemed to be our server s only table outside and he didn t come out to the patio with very much frequency. When I pointed out the hair on the appetizer plate  attached to the food  the server very casually said  ok  I can take that away.  He was incredibly relaxed about the situation  which was confusing  does this happen regularly       I ordered the street tacos as my entree and they were flavorful and very good. When the bill came out  it was full price  charging me for the appetizer I sent back with food items and hair. We asked if the manager was aware of the appetizer situation and the server says  no  but I can tell them.  The server comes back outside looking to cash out and offers me 25  off  I ask  on the bill    which I would have accepted  and he said   no  on the appetizer.  I m sure my jaw dropped at this offer  I explained that we sent our appetizer and food back when we were hungry because there was a hair attached to the food. The least they could do is comp the appetizer. The server said   well  we are trying not to give too much food away.  What    Try wearing hair nets so hair doesn t get in the food  Before we leave  a little girls runs off the play area SCREAMING and in tears because she was bit by ants. We told a third employee to tell the manager about the ants. In the end  the appetizer was comped  the manager never came out to talk to us or perform quality checks on any of the outdoor tables. I have no reason to return to this restaurant.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,29,Me and the wife went for lunch. Ordered fajitas for 2. Only enough meat for three taco s. Not to mention. Meat was overcooked with a bad flavor to it. Wateriest came back with more beef that look somewhat decently cooked. By that time. We had already lost our appetite.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,30,Great food  friendly and fast service. Indoor and outside seating makes it perfect for all seasons. We will definitely come back 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,31,The food was not great which is so disappointing because the restaurant itself is so spacious and has an awesome playscape. Flavorless rice and even refried beans were bland which I didn t think was even possible. Mexican martini was good and chips and salsa were tasty but that s about it  I m afraid to say. Won t be returning unless someone really really wants to or I m desperate for a restaurant with a playscape.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,32,If I could give this place negative reviews I would. The only good thing about this place is the server Ronny. We were seated at the patio and asked for a heater the heater was brought over but not turned on so I asked the manager in the photo and his reply was  it s not that cold outside  and disregarded the request. On to the food it s brought out and not only do the beans and meat look absolutely disgusting but I notice mold on both my tortillas as does my friend. We ask our server for the manager   who is the one in the picture who made the disregard the heater  we notice the server pull him aside and we watch him shew us away and send a  store manager over  she had no clue what was going on because she wasn t the one trained to deal with this. I asked the server who is above her and he tells us the guy so I tell him to tell the manager to come over. He comes over and tries to explain how its the suppliers fault and as he is talking to me he does not care to make any eye contact. Bottom line it is their job to check the food as the get it and DEFINITELY before it s put on a paying customers table. Bottom line the food sucks and the management. Go somewhere better.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,33,We ve been coming to Flores for along time and went there today for lunch kinda disappointed the crispy taco I had broke and fell apart way too thin of a taco shell  the rice was slightly colored white rice with little flavor  the charro beans were really spicy  and the salsa was really hot. However the service was very good fast and attentive.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,34,Stopped in for a quick lunch while running errands. Arrived just before noon and less than 1 4 of the tables were occupied...frequently a bad sign...  Seated immediately by friendly staff  drink order in  chips  amp  salsa  has a bit of a kick  arrive  beer arrives  order from the lunch specials  hot plate arrives. Less than 5 minutes. Hmmmm....frequently a bad sign...  So...it gets better. Beer was cold  but way overpriced at  6.50 for a draft pint. Chicken enchiladas were pretty good at  8.50. Verde sauce was a little soupy. Charro beans are great. Rice a little dry. Did I mention the salsa is pretty good   Dining room filled  up while I was there. Several large groups  10   were seated and didn t seem to slow down the staff  bar  or kitchen.   So wish Yelp allowed half stars  so I ll stick with 3 for now. Will bring the fam to get more input.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,35,2020 - curbside pickup was great. No contact. Friendly. Placed my food in the back of my vehicle. They have a shade setup for their employee. Everyone was wearing masks and gloves.  2019 - I got here before the lunch rush so seating was immediate. The chips were warm and the salsa was a nice mild red sauce
Flores Mexican Restaurant,36,We ve been here for 45 mins and haven t even gotten our waters. It s no where near busy and only a few tables are being used. I cant even rate the food because no server has come over since they brought our chips out 45 mins ago.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,37,Great spot if u have little ones. Nice spacious area for them to play  Great Mexican martinis and margaritas. The homemade tortillas aren t too bad either  Highly recommend.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,38,This was by far the best Mexican food we ve had since moving to texas  The service was swift and the place was clean. All Covid protection measures were in place. Literally every item we ordered on the menu was delish  The salsa is the kick off we begin our authentic judgment there  . We tried the guacamole with chips... so fresh. My husband had the chili reano and I had the chicken chimichanga.  We cleaned our plates  the rich flavors and fresh chicken was amazing. The beans weren t thick and burnt  they were creamy and perfecto. We suggest the martini margarita  smooth and chilled. Going back when we can 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,39,I love Flores. They have a perfect outdoor seating  amp  playground for families both at the Lakeway  amp  Circle C locations. The fresh guacamole and tortillas are the best. Staff can be slow sometimes but it s worth the wait because we just sit outside and let the kids run around
Flores Mexican Restaurant,40,As usual  we enjoyed this a lot. Enchiladas  quest  fajitas were all great. Will be back.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,41,Ordered to go and was told 15 minutes. When I arrive there is a sad tent where you are supposed to pull up and get your To Go or Curbside but there is no one waiting outside. Just a sad cardboard sign saying To Go and Curbside. I parked there for a few minutes then pulled into parking spot right in front and across from sad tent so as not to block traffic. I called and the young woman said my food was not ready and I told her I was here and waiting. She asked me what kind of car I had which I told her. 10 minutes pass and  I get tired of waiting and call and ask if food is ready. She said yes and for me to pull up to tent. While on the phone I reverse from my spot and turn wheels and say I m here. She says some one will be out and then she comes outside and grabs a bag already on the table  remember no one is waiting outside  and brings my food to my car.  Ridiculous  Why did she even ask me what kind of car I had if she was not going to pay attention    Takeaway is they don t want to bother with your curb side order. Also  if you are criminally inclined and you want free food just drive by and pick up a free bag of food  So don t bother with them for To Go or Curbside. Go to any other  ANY  other restaurant that can accommodate you. SMH. Did I say this was ridiculous  Yes. Ridiculous. Kinda comical but yes ridiculous. Forgot to mention the food. I don t like it and only came because the roommate had a hankering. I prefer Maudie s Hacienda ALWAYS over this place. But that s not fair. Its like comparing a ripe peach to a store brand canned variety.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,42,It s so nice to be able to have a drink and watch the kids play at the playground  Good cheese enchiladas and Jose s pollo is good healthish option.  Good friendly service. This is a parents heaven 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,43,Since moving to the area  I ve tried a lot of margaritas at tex-mex spots that have patios and this place is by far my favorite  There is a good deal of patio seating and a generous area for kids to run around while the adults enjoy a meal. The beef fajita meat is excellent here. I really enjoy the steak fajita nachos.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,44,I can t say enough amazing things about this restaurant  The food is consistent  drinks are strong and delicious and service is top notch   I usually get the Power Bowl salad with fajita steak and a Mexican Martini   I promise you  you cannot go wrong with the Queso completo    The avocado  ground beef and tomatoes make it a dish to devour  
Flores Mexican Restaurant,45,We love the food at Flores however the service is sorely lacking. Every time we go there s never more than 4 tables in our area but it takes forever to get service.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,46,My FINAL experience with this restaurant accrued last night when I ordered curbside pick up for my family.  My wife argued with me not to order and insisted we order from Chuy s.  Due to Chuy s website being overloaded on a Friday with traffic  we could not place our order.  I convinced my wife we were ordering Flores.  We ordered the chicken fajitas  one with chicken and shrimp  rice beans  tortillas and a kids meal.  Oh yes  don t forget the Queso.  I ll sum it up...  The chicken was over cooked and had absolutely no taste...  The tortillas were hard  Queso was like water  the salsa was old  not to mention my daughters quesadilla was also terrible. The rice was cold and stale and the beans had absolutely no taste at all.  Our total meal plus tip was over  60.00 and we threw everything away.   I typically don t call or complain about horrible food as I will usually just chalk it up as a loss and never go back  however I felt compelled this time to call the restaurant and complain  it was that bad.  I didn t as for a refund nor did they offer but I did let the gentleman know who answered the phone how bad the food was. He did apologize.  I got a big  Told you so  from my wife.     We will NEVER order or go to this place again.  Terrible and frustrating.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,47,Subpar  not even buffet quality food.   I spent  42 on queso  steak fajitas and shredded chicken chimichangas. The quantity of the food would have gone with the price if the quality went along to match it. Overall it just tasted like there was no care in the ingredients and in the cooking.   The queso had an off taste and was slightly bland.  My roommate had the fajitas. To her it was overly greasy  with way too much onion and peppers and not even sizzling when brought to the table. The charro beans along with it were watered down and the rice was cooked in a more buffet texmex fashion rather than traditional Mexican. To her the only decent part of the plate were the corn tortillas.  When we think of fajitas we imagine fresh meat sizzling of the grill with slight char marks to give it that extra aroma.   My chimichangas were soggy as if they had been frozen or premade and just reheated in an oven or microwave. The chicken itself was bland and uninteresting  especially when the menu said spicy shredded chicken. I don t know if it s a regional thing  but the verde sauce here has a weird tang to it rather than the taste of the actual peppers. The cheese on top was also a gloppy mess that would probably be better served on the side. The black beans I had were pretty watered down and bland. The  When you imagine chimichangas you should imagine a crispy shell. This I did not get.   The side salads on the plates in my opinion were from the salad bags at Walmart. Which isn t too bad. But a restaurant that s been open for 25 years should know better than that.   It s essentially overrated  overrated TexMex rather than Mexican. Service was a bare minimum  but my roommate was not satisfied with the service at all. Won t be going there again at all.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,48,The manger Norma was literally the rudest and passive aggressive worker I ve ever had an interaction with. I m so disappointed in the service and just wanted chicken tenders and a coke that s it 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,49,Seated immediately as we walked in on a Friday evening. Lots of space inside and a pretty big bar area. TV s everywhere to be able to watch whatever sporting events are going on that day. The salsa was pretty good however the queso was sub-par  even after adding the beef  pico and guac. There are definitely better places in Austin to get your queso fix. The food was your average Tex-Mex. The cheese enchiladas had WAY too much chili sauces  you couldn t even taste the cheese. It was like eating chili powder enchiladas. The rice was okay as were the refried beans. The charro beans however were the star of the show  great flavor and spice. The bean burrito was huge but was pretty bland in my opinion  but my sister-in-law said she enjoyed it.  The desserts were much better than the dinner options. The sopapillas were good  as was the flan and the molten lava cake.  The service was also just sub-par  could barely catch our waiter all night.  My over all opinion was that everything was average  my in-laws were satisfied with their plates though so give it a shot to see for yourself.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,50,We were neglected the entire dining service from dirty table to empty glasses. When we went up to the bar to get our own drinks the GM  Angel   yelled at us  said they  we are under staffed  and only wanted to speak to the man at the table as if treating women with respect was below him. I have never never been so disrespected in a restaurant.  This establishment truly does not care about customer service.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,51,Over priced beer.  11.50  for a Miller light and a small draft Dos Equis.  Then a couple dollar tip   13.50  for a couple beers makes expensive beer drinking. No happy hour prices.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,52,We love coming here but it s just Tex Mex. Nothing too  special or exciting. With that being said we have always had good servicee and they are so fast. It s close to where we live so if we are looking for a quick lunch in and out or I don t have anything planned for dinner we love to come here. The chicken fajita nachos are one of our go to s and the Crispy beef tacos. This last visit I ordered the crispy beef tacos and they  were so loaded with beef I could only eat 1 of the 3 tacos. Not a bad thing.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,53,Pleasant local Mexican restaurant.  Had lunch here recently and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very nice  clean  large restaurant.   Really tasty  warm fresh chips and salsa. I had beef enchiladas with rice and black beans for lunch. Everything was quite tasty  freshly made and piping hot on a cold  rainy day.  Service was quick and attentive. I ll definitely be back here again.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,54,If I wanted bland Tex-Mex I would have gone to taco cabana. The only thing this place has going for them is their chips. Now let s talk about the main dish  I ordered fried fish tacos and while the fish was delicious it came dry on tortillas. Who makes tacos like this    I was expecting cilantro  slaw  maybe even cheese  but got none of that. I had to ask for  and was charged for  sour cream as my last resort in making this some what a  normal  taco. My boyfriend ordered the sour cream enchiladas  not knowing they were spicy.  Spicy  not flavorful  Really wish the menu gave a warning. Especially for those who don t like much spice. He told me the chicken was meh  nothing special. Can you say black beans from a can  Not even slightly salty or flavorful. I found myself snacking on the chips to stay full. The hibiscus margarita was also nothing to rave about. What sounded like an epic combination came out to a horrible concoction. Never shall anyone mix tea with margarita mix  Ever  Take it off the menu  please. I thought I d give them the benefit of the doubt when it came to dessert  but even that was subpar. Where d all the salt go  Well  they put it in the sopapillas. Literally tasted like salty bread. While I appreciate the food being hot  it didn t wow me. Now I d give this place an extra star if it wasn t for the lack of attentive service. My boyfriend waited what felt like forever to get a drink refill. So much so I had to give him my water to hold him over. Sadly  this is the second chance I ve taken on this restaurant and the chips are what gives this place the second star.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,55,i have been a fan for many years.   But I think the quality has gone down and I hope the management turns it around.  We had a bday dinner there recently.   The food is good.  No complaints but in spite of restaurant being relatively slow on a Tuesday our service was less than what I expected.  Plates set in front of us for a very long time.  It wasnt busy.  When time for the check  my ticket had 25  tip checked off.  I am a very good tipper but I resented this and changed it to 20 .  Please check your tabs to insure it isnt done.  Come on Flores   you can do better than this 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,56,Flores Four Points is still my favorite because I know all the staff  but now that we live south  this is the new weekly hang for Tex-Mex dinner and drinks. The Flores family scores a home run  with family restaurant locations all over Austin.  Look for the stand-alone building under the oak trees  with beautiful murals painted on each side. Same menus apply at each Flores location  with daily drink and happy hour food and drink specials. Weekends  too  There s a playscape and outdoor seating  so you can keep an eye on your kids and help prevent injuries while you sip your margarita.   Their food menu includes the typical Tex-Mex staples  tacos  enchiladas  fajitas  amp  nachos  plus some of my favorites  chili relleno  amp  shrimp enchiladas  enchiladas del mar   and chicken tortilla soup. Their salsa is made fresh daily  and so are their tortillas  right in front where you can watch. Happy hour includes an appetizer called guacamole completo  with sunflower seeds and feta cheese on top. There s a separate kids  menu  and they supply your wiggly young companion with crayons and a menu to color while they re held captive at the table  because you know that playscape is calling their name more loudly than dinner is.  The bar area has multiple tables and TVs  bigger than the north restaurant s bar section  and is separate from the dining area on the other side of the restaurant. Families to the left  adults only to the right  The restaurant seems fairly closed in when you enter  you walk into a small alcove and pass through a tunnel past the kitchen to get to the bar on the right. The family area of the restaurant is accessed to the left before you enter the tunnel. There s a long table in between  enclosed between two walls  that is reserved for private parties  but it does feel a little tight when everyone is crammed in there.  Weekends bring their own drink specials  including my favorite  a fresh cucumber and mint Mojito for  8. They make a killer spicy margarita  with fresh chopped jalape o. You can score their daily fruit-flavored house margarita every day of the week for  4. So pretty much any day you visit  you ll find something to please every member of the family.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,57,We have tried it 3 times now after they moved from their joint in the strip mall. As I have said before it is mucho mas upscale and more of a gringo margarita place. The old place I loved as it was mostly workers and laborers  it seemed. The food is also more upscale and better for you  which means it does not have as much flavor and character as  the old joint.  They are doing gang buster business so they have found their niche. Will we go back  Yes  Tomas  the hard working gentleman who brings chips around is one of the kindest people we have ever met. His work ethic is something to be admired as he works at least 2 jobs for his family.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,58,Go no further for superior TexMex.  Flores is a family tradition.  From the salsa to the carnitas  amazing meal.  Making no assumptions about the hostess  I figure management instructed hostesses to remain up front  in her seat  dismissive and snarky.    After arriving within a few minutes of our friends  we asked her to point us in the direction of the last couple who arrived. Her response   You re welcome to look around.   When I asked her to simply point us in the direction of the last couple seated  she repeated the exact same statement.  You re welcome to look around.    As a 50 year old man  I remember speaking to my 3 year old nephews in the same manner.  At least have some manners and follow it up with a  sir.   I will find another Flores location in the future. Snarky  passive-aggressive young people have no place on the front lines of the service industry.   The cooks  waitresses  and bar tenders work too hard to lose business because of one person with a really crappy attitude.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,59,Our Sunday afternoon meal lacked the A game effort that Flores usually provides when dining there. The ambience for Sunday is awesome as I was wearing my Dallas Cowboy jersey and other folks had their blue on as well for a place that had lots of flat screens for viewing the win over the SF. Tap selection is good and the chicken quesadilla was good  but my lovely looking Jose Pollo  plate chicken was cold. In fact  I moved through the onions  mushrooms   amp  green peppers to make sure the breast was cooked. The children s playground is a bonus when you have a two year daughter  but the equipment was hot from the sun for my little one. Still not a peanut safe place for Jake due to the mole sauces.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,60,Ok y all. This is naaaaasty  This was first  and last  time at this place. Yep. You see that right. That is a bug of some sort in my food. When our waiter called the manager over  he didn t really seem all that concerned with this and asked me if I wanted to order something different. No  sir. This wasn t just a case of giving me the wrong order. No order comes with a side of bug.   Our waiter was a genuinely nice dude  so nothing against him. But this place is certainly not up to code. There were flies buzzing around us the entire 30 minutes we were there  so I guess that should have tipped me off...  I wish I would have snapped a pic on my way out  but in place of a health inspection sign  there is printer paper taped to the window that says  health information available upon request.    My guest was so grossed out she didn t even touch her food or drink  which they should have comp d in my opinion. It s what I would have done as a former restaurant manager.   Stay far  far away from this place unless you re in the mood for disease ridden food.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,61,Overall I d say this place has good Tex Mex with average service  medium prices  and below average cleanliness. They seem to cater a little more to parents that want their kids to play outside at the playground while they enjoy the sports bar atmosphere.  My wife and I tried Flores out for Mother s Day dinner. They re at a good location close by us. When we first got there we were sat immediately but the hostess didn t say anything to us other than pointing towards our table. She was wearing sweatpants which seemed a bit odd.   The table we were seated at didn t seem like it had been cleaned  there were chips on the table and chairs. The waiter was attentive and brought us our chips  salsa and drinks quickly. The salsa was great  It was hotter than most places which I enjoyed. I started to order the margarita special but the waiter told me it wasn t really worth it because it was smaller. I ended up ordering the top shelf margarita which was pretty good  but super strong. We started with the queso that didn t really seem much better than melted Velveeta with a Jalape o on it  but it was cheap and decently tasty.   My wife and I split the chicken fajitas for two  we d probably split the fajitas for one next time . The fajitas came out quickly with a ton of meat and sides. They were really good and the tortillas seemed like they had been toasted which was nice    While we were eating there were a few kids running around. The inside seems more like a sports bar than a family restaurant. The bar was packed  there were a lot of TVs and it was quite loud. When I went to go to the bathroom the maintenance staff had propped open the men and the women s bathroom with the trash can. There was a toilet scrubber and a bucket in the bathroom sink of the men s room.   We ll probably come again but I think we ll try to avoid the evening crowd.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,62,We decided to come here for cinco de mayo to indulge in Mexican food  as most Americans do. We called earlier to ask how long the wait was  and they told us 15 min. When we got there  the wait was actually 1 hour. What   We literally had just called. They allow you to see where you are in line through an app  so I guess that s a bonus. I ordered the Lito Plate and a pomegranate margarita  which was the daily special for  4.   LITO PLATE  3 5  it was pretty average. It comes with a cheese enchilada  beef chalupa  beef taco  rice and your choice of beans. There was really nothing memorable about this unfortunately. However I was surprised that a real chalupa is nothing like Taco Bell. Sad     Overall  the food was prettty average. Our waiter was excellent though  I give him props for maintaining a good attitude for such a busy day. I know it can be stressful having to please so many customers  but he did his best to accommodate us.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,63,I enjoy Flores  my whole family enjoys their food  and I have always thought their prices to be a good value.  But recently we have been let down when we order food to go.  At least twice when we have ordered Joe s Tacos  the dish has been missing its usual accoutrements of guacamole salad  sour cream  and shredded cheese. And on more than one occasion  our order of unsweet tea has come home as sweet tea.  I do not feel that these will be reasons for us to pass on Flores in the future  but it certainly will cause us to pause next time we consider to make a recommendation to friends and family.  Attention to detail is what causes any business to stand out above the rest  and recently Flores does not.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,64,I really like the exceptional food here. Everything is always so tasty. Yesterday there was some kind of s glitch in my order but Angel took care of everything and I enjoyed my awesome Mexican food.  The service here is always incredible and you cant beat the food anywhere. Flores Mexican Food South Austin is always a treat because they treat everyone like royalty.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,65,Decent fajitas . Nothing extraordinary  come here for team lunches or work lunches. Service is good . Food is good. Just an ordinary Mexican restaurant. Nothing authentic or show stopping about it .
Flores Mexican Restaurant,66,If I could rate the experience I just had a 0... I would. Google says they are open til 11 30. The front door says they are open til 11. We showed up at 10 02. Waited for 5 minutes and someone finally came to greet us and said verbatim  can I help you with something    Uh... yea... we d like to eat...   He said  we are closed    I said  well your door says you re open til 11     We aren t     Cool...   What a joke. You don t get to serve mediocre Mexican food and have condescending service. The other 1000 Mexican food restaurants will be getting our business instead.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,67,I ve been to two other Flores Restaurants before and wasn t too impressed. I ve lived close to this one for over a year and kinda ignored it based off my prior experience at the other two locations.   Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised at the outstanding service and excellent food here. They had us in and out with delicious food in like 30mins   And they were super busy.   If you want fast friendly service with some really good food  this spot is for you.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,68,Can t say enough good things about this place. Bartenders- amazing. They don t short you on liquor and will make up cool stuff when you don t know what you want. And they carry chamoy tajin  Food A1  My favorite is the chicken enchilada with white cheese  green sauce  and sour cream   4 on the lunch menu . Queso is also yummy.   They also have sombreros to take pics in. And a playscape if you accidentally had kids
Flores Mexican Restaurant,69,This is more of a 2.5 star for me.  The restaurant itself is a magnet for SW Austin residents to grab their drink on while ignoring their kids injure themselves on the huge playscape out back.  That alone was worth a half star in entertainment value alone.  You know when a small child wrecks himself falling off the top of the jungle gym  picks himself up  looks around  and slowly walks into the restaurant  finds appropriate adult slugging down her margarita in her overly tight Fabletic gear and then starts whaling.  The bar was hoping with loads of regulars  everyone seeming to know each other.  There was a massive TV at the front of the bar and one on every wall about 5 ft from each other.  As mentioned  there were also loads of mums with said child  blissfully ignoring the fact they were being extremely loud  pounding on tables  screaming for no apparent reason  making the environment somewhat a kin to a kids birthday party at Chucky Cheese  but I am at a bar so I digress.  Some of the bright spots... our waiter was very good and attentive to us. Knew exactly what Suzie wanted to drink when she described what she was looking for. Their hot-sauce with our chips was on point.  They have traditional bean and cheese nachos  however they need to have a salamander broiler in the kitchen  since the chips were soggy and not crisp as we are usually acustomed too.  Queso was fine.  I got a frozen rita which was fine and Suzie got a Herradura  Margy rocks which she enjoyed.  As we were getting to the bottom of our drinks  the noise  kids and the general chaos unfolding around us was just a little to much to handle and we closed our tab and headed over the Santa Rita.  At least we checked them out.  As I thought about this more  this is kind of a place where parents would take their kids with them  but probably would never venture out to Flores on a date night without them. Loads of options for Mexican around us in the hood  so we at least have that in our favor.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,70,My family and I love Flores for their yummy margaritas  tasty food and large portions. They make their own tortillas there in house and do not shy away from spice--I m a big fan of the carne roja  warning  pretty dang spicy   while my kids love their carnitas. As far as frozen margaritas in Austin  I personally love the La Florita  their house frozen  and consider it one of the best in town. Their menu is extensive and offers LOTS of options. Bonus for families with young children  huge play area in the back the is completely enclosed. You can sit outside while your kids play  or you can be seated in the bar area and watch them through the windows.  We ve only ever come for dinner  so I can t comment on what the experience is like if you re just dropping in for a quick lunch. We usually take our time and spend at least a couple of hours their noshing on the always-being-refilled-chips and salsa and drinking margaritas. True Tex-Mex done well.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,71,We ate here last night   we ordered a mixed fajita  It was  really bad   firstly it wasn t sizzling   beef was tough   chicken over cooked and nothing was seasoned . Tasted really bland   needed salt . Kids running constantly inside the restaurant     Won t be back  
Flores Mexican Restaurant,72,I m so glad I took some of my friends recommendations for this restaurant  It s so good I highly recommend their enchiladas and margaritas 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,73,I went to lunch here today with coworkers. I ordered the  4 lunch special chicken enchiladas with green sauce and charro beans with a side of two tortillas. The charro beans came in a small bowl and well didn t have actually much beans in them. My main reasoning for the low grade is one of the chicken enchiladas had a long strand of hair inside the enchilada. I m officially never eating here again.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,74,came here for some dinner and so my daughter could play. I got the chicken taco salad. The chicken tasted bland  like something you d get in a nursing home. I wouldn t recommend eating outside. I looked away from my food to feed my daughter and there were about 10 flies on it  no joke not the reason for 3 stars . Granted they can t control the bugs that are outside but still disgusting. The waiter was great tho  he had no problem bringing me something else. This place is best to watch the game  get some drinks  but as far as mexican food  you could go elsewhere. They have an outdoor playscape that is fenced in.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,75,Easily one of my favorite spots when I m in Austin  Texas. The restaurant is typically staffed adequately and seldom do you wait for seating or service. Early dinner on a Thursday evening  5pm  was filled with families and their children  I only heard one scream  one time but mostly of the joyful playing was outside and it seemed the parents were grateful for a safe spot to let the little ones play and run around without interrupting the adult drinks and conversations.   Our service wasn t that great this time but the place was packed  temps in the upper 60 s and Spring Break were likely causes .  My group had regular and top-shelf margaritas and nobody complained  I had the chicken fajita taco salad - big enough for two in a perfectly delectable shell but it seemed to lack any special quality. It was enough for three people.   Anytime I m back in Austin I ll head here 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,76,Friendly waiter  which was great  but if I could give this place a half star for the bug in my friend s food  I would. There were plenty of flies around us  gnats too  but this one was baked into her food. Won t be back here again.  I was maybe a fourth of the way through my meal and was definitely not going to finish it after that. The manager came over to  apologize   comp d her meal  looked down at my FULL plate  and proceeded to scurry back to the kitchen. I paid about  33 for a disgusting experience. DO NOT EAT HERE.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,77,I don t get how this place only has 3 stars. Especially during a pandemic.  This place is open and the staff was so friend. The food was great. You can always tell how your meal is going to be based on the chips and salsa and how your server greets you. It was awesome. The food was great. Check em out. Very happy I found a good Mexican restaurant.  As a Mexican I m for sure glad this place was open cause I got what I was craving.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,78,This new location seems to have put all the emphasis on the newly designed locale and decor  but a poor effort in the food. Everything tastes microwaved  and if it is saut ed or supposedly grilled  it s overdone... Oily and too much of that Burger King charred taste - in other words it tastes as though a  grilled  extract is used as opposed to actual grilling.  The queso   cheese they use tastes like velveeta or some sort of cheese that s been nuked for too long.  I ordered the shrimp tacos  and received fish tacos... They fixed this immediately. The shrimp I had was oily and tasted as though it came in a frozen bag. The charro didn t look appealing  but was really good  Surprisingly good. The rice was decent  it tasted like the Uncle Ben Mexican microwaveable rice packs. I hated that a huge portion of my plate was overwhelmed by a slapped together array of lettuce and tomatoes that served no purpose in this dish... Bland  boring and just unnecessary  at least make it a pico de gallo.  The sad truth is that Taco Bell does a better job... And I hate Taco Bell  The only saving grace is that the very young staff of hosts and  waiters were very friendly attentive and personable. Besides that  if you want really good tex mex  go to CURRAS ON OLTORF  or if you want more authentic Mexican food  worth the price  go down the block to HECHO EN MEXICO 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,79,We came here on Sunday evening around 7 45 for Mother s Day dinner and it was decently busy but we were seated right away. The hostess was wearing sweats and couldn t have acted less interested or happy to be there if she tried. We ordered pretty quickly and my husband got a strawberry margarita  the waiter did a good job talking up the top shelf tequila and the bartender was heavy handed it seemed  it was STRONG  haha.   The bathrooms weren t DIRTY but they definitely hadn t been cleaned in a bit  and my seat at the table had a huge grease spot and crumbs like the table was just wiped off onto the floor chairs. Not a huge problem but it was a bit of a turn off to start with.   We started off with the queso which was just melted velveeta with a few jalape os to garnish  not much to complain about for 3.95 though. The chips and salsa were good  the salsa tasted house made. We decided to split the fajitas for two and I ordered a beef taco as well. The portions for the fajitas were HUGE  it was awesome. We each got our own plate of rice and beans  a large plate with sour cream  guac  pico  cheese  amp  lettuce as well as tortillas and TONS of meat  amp  peppers. It was pretty tasty and we have leftovers for a few days of lunch  But the taco........I couldn t even get past my first bite. It was so salty it was unbearable  I had my husband take a bite and he almost spit it out. That being said  our waiter was pretty attentive and the guy that delivered the food was super nice. We ll probably stop in here again.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,80,Done with this place  I can t do Flores anymore  we ve ordered from there multiple times for lunch.  Inconsistent preparation times and improper food order completion.    We place to go order  my colleagues arrive to pick up the order and it s not bagged up yet so they end up scarfing it down there  they have them wrap up my order and bring it back to the office.  The order is specifically ordered for a vegetarian so they knew to change out the rice  chicken stock  for beans and also changed out the sauce  meat sauce for their vegetarian green sauce  yet the filling in the burrito had ground beef.  Now no lunch and no reasonable resolution.    Will have to stick with the other Mexican restaurant options in the area.  Wish I had taken a photo of the burrito before throwing.  The Management handled this terribly with their response  asked for a refund on the phone and she said she d fix the order as well initially.  My staff member goes for a the burrito and the refund  then the manager changes the story and says the replacement food or the refund.....got the refund and moved on.  Ridiculous waste of time.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,81,I took my family here last night.  Their margaritas essentially had zero tequila in them.  When we told the waitress she said   well the regulars are pounding them  so I m pretty sure they are ok    There was an incident where a guy who couldn t speak English kept trying to bring us chips.  I felt bad for him  the waitress was rude to him in front of us.    So if you like margaritas that have a drop of tequila  and you like your waitress to be wearing skin tight black jeans with no socks and vans  who have Marlboro lights sticking out of their back pocket.  This is the place for you....  Food was subpar.  I ordered a taco salad  the shell had no crunch  it s the same one you can buy at Walmart or Heb just stale.    I wouldn t ever go here again.  The staff don t seem to care about their jobs  and the drinks essentially were virgin  aka  sans alcohol.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,82,The food is delicious  it s not expensive. My parents came here twice to eat and brought me. I recommend this place to everyone.   You may have to wait  but it is worth the wait 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,83,The good part about this review is that the pozole was very good and I ll come back for the pozole again. What I didn t like is that they do not have a breakfast taco menu. They don t have traditional foods such as barbacoa or lengua. When I ask for hot sauce salsa don t offer me something that comes in a bottle. Most Mexican restaurants bring tortillas with all of the food  I had to ask for tortillas for my pozole.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,84,Best fajitas for two for the price. Great drinks also. Corona premier on tap for you low carbers out there      The Paloma s are great  and I m told you don t need more than 2 Floritas.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,85,Clean  good prices and it has a big playground for the kids to play while I enjoy my magnificent margarita 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,86,Food s pretty typical. They had a frozen passion fruit margarita on special when we went. If I didn t have the alcohol tolerance of a 3rd grader I would have had 13 of them.  The playground is what we keep going back for. Isn t it funny how having kids changes your standards of a good place to eat 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,87,My family of 5 loves this place   Great atmosphere  The play ground is amazing   The kids get to play and make friends while we get to relax and enjoy a  la Flor   margarita  kids  are always happy with thier meal and so are we  Fresh child amd tortillas   Oh and everyone that works there is pretty awesome too   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,88,We had dinner here the server was great and friendly  Food was good  I didn t like the refried beans they need flavor. I like that the tortillas are homemade yum  
Flores Mexican Restaurant,89,Gonzalo is a phenomenal individual  knowing him and the authenticity that s been attached to this restaurant is a true illustration of who is and also what he represents. The food is outstanding and made with love and unlike most restaurant chains you get genuine service here. I love everything about this establishment  I plan on giving my business here now  and far more to however he plans to expand. A. MUST. VISIT. ESTABLISHMENT
Flores Mexican Restaurant,90,My family and I came here for dinner on a Sunday. We chose this place because they had a playground outside and we were craving some Mexican food   I ordered the fajita beef tacos with rice and black beans. They gave me lots of meat  enough to take home and make another taco  But the rice and beans were very plain  They had not much  if any  seasoning in them. But the margaritas were pretty good from what my mom and grandma say   Everyone was just okay with their meals  we all left full but felt a big lack in flavor. However my son enjoyed his quesadilla then had lots of fun on the playground. It was a decent size and there also was a garden back there  which makes me want to ask if they grow all their veggies  I may or may not ask  only because I m not sure if we will return.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,91,Went for breakfast. Always really liked the old location. This one might be nicer looking  but I am not impressed so far.  Basically there was a huge gross smudge of lipstick on my coffee mug. The manager offered a replacement coffee which is fine  but then she tried to convince us it was clean because it was run through a dishwasher. Well who knows. Maybe it was or wasn t. The manager gave us the option to leave. By that time my wife had enough and we just chose the second option.   They don t seem to gracefully take complaints or criticism. We won t be back.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,92,I love this place  The food and drinks are great and the playground is very entertaining especially for school age kids 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,93,I love the new building. Do Much better than the old one that had zero ambience.   I really like to eat in the bar. But the bar is crawling with little kids. Hello families   Why are you eating I the bar area with your screaming kids  
Flores Mexican Restaurant,94,Great margs  I guess I should say more...we always get great service and my kiddos love the playground. Food is always very good  I try something different almost each time and it s always very good. But to really judge a Mexican food restaurant  it starts with the margaritas and the margaritas here are the best 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,95,Food was very typical of a Mexican place. Our reservations were 7pm for a group of 11. Our food didn t come till almost 8pm. SEVERELY understaffed - our poor waitress was in charge of a very big area   A 12 year old boy  literally  was at the welcome booth and the hostess was not organized at all. This place had potential to be pretty good bit the lack of organization and service would prevent me from ever coming back again. Very disappointing.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,96,This was my first visit to Flores Mexican restaurant. GPS had me going to William Cannon from I-35 so driving through all of the lights on William Cannon seemed to have took forever....but we made it    Next time I will take Mopac.  Parking  Went at 5 30 on a Saturday and found parking with no issues. Nice large parking area.  Service  We sat as a group since I went for a birthday dinner. They allowed us to separate the ticket by assigning us a ticket number so if we ordered anything after that we had to give them our ticket number. I was happy they let us split the check so no complaints on that. My sweet tea was never refilled  I had to request for a refill if I wanted one.  This could be because I was in a big group that each time they came around somebody was requesting something . The servers were courteous.  Food  The chips and salsa were addicting. I liked the spice level of the salsa  The salsa was thick and very red..yum  Tortillas were being made homemade and I saw the lady in action  The flour tortillas were tasty  I ordered the shrimp cocktail. It was good. I also tried a beef fajita taco. It was good too  The fajitas were yummy. We requested some salsa and tortillas when we packed the to go box of fajitas  leftovers  but all they gave us was an empty container but no salsa. We just used what we had on the table from earlier.     They charge 25cents for four flour tortillas and will not throw some in to go with the to go order     The single order of fajitas included three tortillas. I am not sure if that is standard for most places but wanted to mention that. The rice and charro beans were good. My friend ordered the brisket taco and fajita taco with rice on the side. She enjoyed the tacos but had to request a tortilla since her tortilla got soggy from the brisket oil. Somebody ordered the beef fajita nachos. It looked real good and they did not shy away from providing the meat. Lots of meat on those nachos.  I definitely will like to go back again.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,97,Really good tex-mex food  although a little more upscale than they used to be when located in the strip mall. It s kind of a trade off. Bigger menu  but a little less of that  Austin dive  feel and flavor. Service was good  and the chips and salsa are always a nice staple.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,98,Food came out at the same time and hot for a party of 15  That s a big deal   The special of  the day pomegranate margaritas were super and just the right size.   The kids enjoyed the outdoor play set  which was helpful since the wait was about 30 minutes.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,99,Food is nothing special but the management and service are sub par. We go 2 times week for margaritas  food and to let our kid play on the playground. The conversation among patrons outside always turns to the same topic and that is why does Flores have a patio and playground if they don t want to dedicate wait staff to take care of the customers plus the playground is disgusting. Seems like no one ever cleans it. My final straw was this past week finding broken glass very visible on top of the playground mulch and a giant rusted piece of jagged metal. I picked it up and showed both to a server when they finally graced us with their presence but they couldn t have cared less. My actual server was so averse to taking care of our table that she wouldn t even walk outside. She would only open the door to the patio  poke her head out and yell  Sir  you re fine   before giving me a chance to really answer.   The customer last mentality starts from the moment you pull into the parking lot. Convenient parking spots are taken by employees. I ve worked in restaurants and retail. Never were employees allowed to take the best spots. Next time you re at Flores and see a big black SUV  Suburban or Yukon type  parked in the single spot out front its an employee. When you walk in the front door there s never anyone there to seat customers. More often than not we have to walk down the hall and around the corner to find someone and let them know we would like to get a table.  Tired of spending  50- 75 before tip and tipping well a few times a week then feeling like our business is a nuisance. I ve spoken to Eric  manager  more than once and nothing changes.  If I can figure out how to attach pictures of the filth on the playground I will post them.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,100,Don t trust their text messaging waitlist  you can be skipped   Service and food was alright. House Margaritas were not enjoyable.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,101,This is my friends and I s favorite place ever to enjoy good drinks and delicious food. Love the atmosphere in the bar. Mmmm Mexican martinis   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,102,Amazing experience  Great food   fast service  authentic Mexican food    Pomegranate margarita wow we loved it    we will definitely go back soon   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,103,The carne guesada is great here.  The handmade flour and corn tortillas are good.  We didn t like the rice it was too bland.  Black beans are better than the pinto beans. They only carry Pepsi products not Coke.    The staff is really nice.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,104,Generally unimpressed with the overall experience. Chips and salsa are sup par  as well as the rice and beans. My beef fajita taco was tasty. I think understaffing was the culprit  but my service at the bar was horrendous. I was really hoping for an authentic Mexican food experience but I was sorely disappointed. Never coming back.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,105,Good food  decent prices  usually no wait and the best part as a parent is that there is a patio for kids   My only wish was that there was seating options outside by the playground besides a couple of benches so you could have drinks and an appetizer while the kids play.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,106,Food was good. I ordered the quesadilla and it was definitely bigger than just an appetizer. The service was nice and the place looked nice.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,107,I met up with my friends here during the World Cup and they put on the Mexico vs. South Korea game. There was a decent crowd for the game. Flores is open at 9 am on Saturdays and Sunday and have a decent breakfast menu. It s not a huge menu compared to their regular dinner menu. I like their chips and salsa. I know that is a weird thing to say but I ve had chips that were stale and I had to douse them with salsa. I ordered a just two eggs  sausage  beans and potatoes. My friend loved her migas. She says she judges a restaurant by their migas. They make their own tortillas at the restaurant. Service was good except the moment the waitress asked me what I wanted in my Mexican Irish Coffee and I didn t know because I rarely order it. I just ordered it because I like coffee with some variation of taste.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,108,Disclaimer  I ve only been here once.  Mediocre food meets delicious margaritas and upbeat ambience.   We ordered two margaritas  chips and queso and were served salsa for round one. The margaritas were strong  and slightly sweeter than straight lime juice and tequila. Overall  we enjoyed them and acquired a decent buzz. The chips and queso were great. Super sticky creamy cheesy queso with several jalape os mixed. Salsa was spicy  but not too hot.  We ordered Cheese Enchiladas and Beef Fajitas. The enchiladas were ok. The corn tortillas tasted old. And the chile con carne was meh. Lacked basic TexMex flavor and seasoning. The beef fajitas also lacked all the delicious seasonings you expect from fajitas  did I really just get served beef flank steak without basic salt and pepper  .   You know... The best way to judge a Mexican restaurant is to check if they make their own tortillas. Failure to make something this simple is a huge red flag  and unfortunately we were served old or reheated tortillas. Shame   Probably won t be back. Too many good Mexican restaurants that serve good margaritas  an upbeat atmosphere and fantastic food. This place needs a new chef and they would flourish.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,109,Decent food  great playground  the tables outside are tiny and they won t serve you if you sit at the only large picnic table. They also don t allow dogs outside  although I ve seen one here before  but perhaps it depends on the manager.  Relatively good food  not Matt s El Rancho  but better than average. Drinks are decent.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,110,Didn t love it  wasn t bad though    The bad  Prices were high  beef was tough  pepsi products  red flag   sides weren t impressive...  The good  the chips  salsa and queso were great. A fine happy hour spot  skip dinner though.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,111,Not a good value for the price. Portions are wastefully big but lack flavor. Mixed drinks are ok but too much ice... Matt s el rancho on south lamar has much better food and drinks for about the same price. Kids play garden is great.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,112,The key to Flores is knowing what you order.  And for the most part the best thing to do is to follow Yogi Berra s advice  keep it simple stupid .    I know they are a tex-mex place but the enchiladas are not that good but do you know what is good   The tortillas.  So when ordering stick to things that highlight the tortillas.  Go with soft tacos or fajitas.  Essentially order something that doesn t drown your meal in chili or cheese.  Like cheese you say  well order the Queso Flameado with either Shrimp or Fajita Beef  preferably with corn tortillas.  One of the things I wish they would do is make their chips in house because they have a very underrated salsa.  Now that I have gotten that out of the way let s cut to the chase and discuss what really brings you in the door.  THE MARGARITAS      Daily Margarita Specials that have a different flavor every day.  For the cost these are some of the best margaritas in town.  Decent beer selection as well with a reasonable price whether it is their daily 4-7 happy hour or not.  Also their bar area has a lot of TVs and is a pretty good place to watch football.  Sure you can have better Mexican food in Austin but when you factor in the cost vs the drink specials Flores is not a bad little spot.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,113,Had the chicken mole enchiladas. They were very flat with less chicken than tortilla. Tasted only like the mole  the enchiladas were flavorless. Friend had the fajitas. They came out room temperature and dry. Largely ignored by the waiter who gave us the wrong bill.  14 for really bad enchiladas doesn t cut it  there are too many better restaurants in the area.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,114,They have moved from a strip mall to a new stand-alone location and it is an upgrade  It seems that Flores has hit the big time and is competing with the likes of Z-Tejas with it s modern Texas Hill Country flair. The limestoney building seems  for some reason  to have grabbed my attention more than the food  which was decent. But  the check was higher than it should have been for basic Mex food.   The place was quite bustling. People are going for it. That s the free market  folks  So you can take your work partner there and not feel embarrassed about the interior and come away with a decent meal  but if you savor the sabor of a diner at low dinero  Flores-the-new need not be high on your list.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,115,Always consistent on there freshness of greatness menu items.  The salsa is by far hot and spicy FRESH goodness. Great service every time.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,116,I m sorry to write this review.  I have been a customer for a very long time but the last 2 visits ended it.  It has been less then great   or even good  since the new location opened.   2 weeks ago went and had the very worst service ever  the management changed servers and carried on. It was lunchtime  food was  meh .  Just an off day all around. Went in last night for pre-game meet up.  My daughter ordered nachos  well her nachos came with a huge moth right in the middle of them.  I didn t get a picture because I was in shock.  They took them away and the manager came and asked me where it came from - I told her it came on the plate.  She looked skeptical and laughed it off.  I mean we weren t laughing in anyway and really couldn t eat after that.  They sent another plate  couldn t touch it.  I don t feel like they were concerned or went back and checked anything out.   I can t go back.  If there is a giant bug on a plate  please take it seriously.  I do. I didn t take a photo but found one that is representative of what was on the plate.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,117,Came in with my spouse around 5 PM on a Sunday. Service was fast. It was pretty empty so our server checked in on us a LOT. Fresh chips were delicious and crisp  salsa was nice  a side of guac was tasty. Fried jalapenos were pretty good. Shrimp tacos were good  enchiladas were good. No complaints.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,118,This place is REALLY mediocre. I m surprised it has three stars on Yelp.  Every OTHER cheese dip at every other place is better than the one they have here. Flores  cheese dip tastes like Velveeta with a little meat and guacamole in the center.  Service is decent  which is why it gets two stars. We got the carne asada  which was mediocre.  Don t waste your money here.   And don t be fooled  as we were  by the lights outside. There s no outdoor seating.  Take the deserted restaurant for what it is and leave    Go down the street to Jalapeno s   VERY disappointed.  Wouldn t return.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,119,Always great food and service. I don t know why every review is not 5 stars. The bar serves as great neighborhood pub for the area. Love Flores.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,120,Best margaritas in town     The food is great too and the staff is always friendly   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,121,You know the feeling you get that the fancier and brighter bigger the Mexican restaurant  the poorer the food is  That s the case here. After spending gobs of money on this beautiful property you would think the food wouldn t seem like an afterthought. I couldn t even get the napkin separated from the silverware without shredding  it was rolled and folded so tightly.   Maybe it s just me but I like to pick up crispy tacos and crush the shell with my gob. Even on a plate by itself  this taco was so soggy it disintegrated and was pushed to the edge of the table for our server to ignore throughout the rest of the meal.   Not to be outdone  the beef chalupa was also un-pickup-able having been placed on top of the chili sauce atop the enchilada. In short  it was all mush and left uneaten with the exception of the unexceptionable cheese enchilada.   Like most people  I don t usually make a fuss or ask to talk to the manager about how lacking the food is. I just don t come back. The second star is only for the fresh warm chips and spicy salsa.   I haven t been a waiter in a looong time but when a customer leaves whole  uneaten portions of a meal they are paying good money for  I would probably  maybe  ask  how is everything   before offering the check. Not so here but at least they re consistent.   Perhaps they re just new and will listen to their clientele. I truly hope so or this is going to make a lovely Italian Bistro someday soon.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,122,I love Flores.  I don t know why there are so many bad reviews. They have great margaritas and I always order my favorites  fajita chicken tacos and enchilada poblana.  Top that off with a DosXXX or a margarita and now you re talking.  The waiters are also very friendly and give you plenty of free chips.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,123,This place is great - awesome brunch and happy hour.  In addition  they have all the sports packages  making it an inviting place to watch a game.  Bartenders are always friendly and attentive.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,124,My first entree came out with hair. My second entree came out with soggy tacos. Couldn t even eat. Called to talk the manager. Hung up on me.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,125,This is my second time giving them a chance. I think I honestly came here cause it was close to my house. What a waste of money. I think it s so busy cause there is nothing over here. The bartender service is horrible isn t even the word. Lazy  lazy  hmmm I mean this place is horrible. I have tried two different plates. Cold chips  not so great drinks. The owners know they have a gold mine  there is nothing around here   I won t be back. Save your time and money.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,126,Went there for lunch  amp  ordered from lunch menu. Meat had no flavor  and was the same in all parts of the lunch selection. Have eaten there for dinner  and food was great. Suggest not ordering off the lunch menu.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,127,A regular here  Love the Saturday and Sunday breakfast  as there s no wait and the food is good and the drinks are strong  Flores is an Austin staple in my opinion.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,128,The only reason I come to this place is because my friends have kids and they have a fenced playground.  The food is flavorless and the drinks are just ok.  I wouldn t recommend this place if you re looking for a great meal  but if you want an easy place to eat outside and let the kids hang out this is a good place for that 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,129,I  have never written a review  but there have been many deserving establishments where I should  have done so.   I haven t been to Flores Restaurant  Oak Hill location  in many years. My granddaughter said the new Flores Restaurant had just recently opened on Wm. Cannon  amp  Brush Country   so we decided to check in out last night. The parking lot looked relatively full when we got there about 8pm. We got seated right away. The server was courteous and attentive at first.   When we got our food  the lady that brought the food was very rude and didn t put any thought into putting the dishes on the table. For example  she first tossed down the tortilla container right in front of my husband. He had to move them to have a place for his plate. My granddaughter and I had enchiladas. She said abruptly   beef or chicken  charros or black  . I  told her that my granddaughter had refried beans  but she left the black beans on the table. After she served us  I told her again that my granddaughter ordered refried beans. She comes back with a plate of beans and sets it on top of the tortilla container    Food  Terrible    I had the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. It was the worst mole I ever ate   I couldn t even eat the first enchilada. I tried to just eat the chicken by itself. It had no taste to it. The rice wasn t cooked completely.  Still crunchy. The black beans were the only edible thing. My granddaughter had beef enchiladas with chili con carne sauce. Even she was unimpressed. She said the enchiladas at her high school cafeteria were better  I tried some of her sauce and it wasn t that great. My husband said his chile roja plate was good. I rarely leave food on my plate  usually taking leftovers home  but I pretty much only at 25   if even that of my plate.   Service   Our server  was only seen at first when we ordered and when we were ready to go. We only had our waters refilled once by someone else. He brought our check  then he was no where to be found. We waited about 10 minutes. Finally my husband stands up  puts on his coat and that still didn t catch anyone s attention. He starts walking with the check towards the kitchen. There were two staff people sitting at a table right by him talking. They didn t pay attention to him. Finally someone in the kitchen area asked if he needed his waiter. At that point the server took care of the check. Not once were we asked about the food. I m especially surprised since i left most of our food on my plate.   Considering the owners spent a lot of money building this nice restaurant  they won t have many customers if they don t improve on their service and food   Needless to say  we ll never be back. There are a lot of better Mexican restaurants in town.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,130,Wow  this new Flores location really is that bad as most of the reviewers here say. Too bad too because this place has so much potential. Great location  very nice decor  and a perfect demographic for them. The food here is mediocre to terrible at best. My wife ordered the combo plate and all of it was less than Taco Bell quality. The ground beef was so incredibly salty it was almost inedible. The rest of the plate  a taco and tostada were bland and boring. My steak fajita quesadilla was good as always but everything else I ve tried here has been just awful.   The service here is just as bad as the food. We walked in at lunch hour and just stood there waiting in an empty lobby. Some kitchen staff and servers passed by and saw us several times and just kept walking without acknowledging us or doing a thing. When we finally got seated our food took forever  drinks and salsa were never refilled and I had to go chasing someone down for a box and the bill. There were maybe 2 other tables with people in the entire place. The problem with this new location is there is so many places for the wait staff to hide  at the old location it was one big open space so it was hard for them to avoid and ignore you. How this place stays in business is beyond me  avoid at all costs.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,131,Great food  Good service  And be outdoor playground is perfect for little ones  I almost always get the quesadillas. They are my favorite. Their tortillas are so delicious.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,132,Absolutely loved Flores thank you for moving to my neighborhood   I usually come here during lunch for my standard 2 fajita tacos for lunch  usually to go  always in a hurry...this time brought my girlfriend for dinner  from the personable ladies up front  to the superb service by Miguel  believe me you want this guy at your table reminded me of myself 20 plus years ago when I used to wait on tables  I had fun and made great tips  I m sure Miguel does very well too very attentive suggested my new favorite tequila   Tres Generaciones A ejo  Si se or   Delicioso. The Shrimp Cocktail was fabulous  I had to let Patricia the manager know about the great service and food  decor and ambiance all there. My honey  a very picky eater  loved her tacos too and the most awesome Margarita...what else to say  well...we ll be back again and again.  Ricardo and Brenda
Flores Mexican Restaurant,133,OH YAY  A brand new Mexican restaurant to torment Husboy with  Just kidding. No I m not. He is still learning to love Mexican food  and the first time we went to this restaurant it was okay. The second time  it was worse  and there wasn t a third time.  Their consistency is great  They consistently are too packed  their tables are consistently too close together  the waitresses consistently don t care about service  it s consistently loud  they consistently serve us chips from a service tray that is filled with food from a table that has just been cleared  they consistently bump into us as we re dining  and the customers are consistently loud and standing around the tables.  The food is good  though  and I love the tortillas  So  if you can get past the uncomfortable seating  bumping  moshpit that is the dining floor  it s all good.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,134,This is my favorite Mexican restaurant.  I started going there when they were down the street in a tiny little space.  They have expanded to several locations because of the quality of their food and drinks.  Always have great service.  My favorite for brunch are the migas and combo fajitas for  9.95.  I always save half to eat for another breakfast.  Also love their homemade tortillas 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,135,Today was our first time trying Flores as it was recommended by a friend. We were not impressed. While the food is very good  the service we received today was way below our expectations. It took awhile to be greeted once sat  the wrong beverages were delivered  we waited over 20 minutes for our server to take our order  and normal expectations like chip and drink refills were not given until way past the time of request. Top it off with a 14 minute wait for our payment to be processed and we simply will not return. Fantastic food can t take the place of at least adequate service.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,136,Great service and great food.  Not to mention pretty darn good ritas as well.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,137,This Flores location has been open for a while but I only recently tried it and its between A-ok and meh. There were some things I liked  the salsa was very tasty  and our server was prompt and polite. I got the pollo caliente  the chicken was thin and the sauce was spicy but also sort of sweet which turned me off  the charro beans were watery and not flavorful. I would not go out of my way to go again  I would stick to this place for a drink and some chips and salsa only.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,138,So took a few days for me to think of how to word my review without bashing the restaurant. So my favorite  and husband s  favorite part of the meal was the chips and salsa. The Ranchera sauce on the enchiladas is very acidic and taste like tomatoes out of the can. They don t give you lettuce and tomato with your plates  which is standard everywhere else.. breaks up the heaviness of the Mexican food. I did like the spinach in the enchiladas and was cooked just right. The beans are blah  they don t have true flavor to me.. My husband had the chicken enchiladas and the chicken is a mixture of white meat and dark meat. Last time I had the chicken enchiladas I didn t like them because they were mostly dark meat.   I can t say this is the worse Mexican food I have ever had BUT it is not work the  9.25 a plate.. I have had better chicken at Plato Loco  in Dallas  and at food trucks around Austin. We had about 2 different servers and the main server walked away with my husband s water and never replenished it. We finally had to ask another server for water.   The new interior is pretty and I just wish they would upgrade their food. BUT obviously they have a strong clientele or they wouldn t of been able to move. So I guess they have found their niche with some people.   I won t be going back to this location again.. if I ever visit a Flores then it will only be in Dripping Springs.. that location has good food. Same family  and yet different taste 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,139,I m a native San Antonian so that is my perspective on TexMex. Flores is bland and boring. I had Maria s plate and that comes with cheese enchiladas  a crispy beef taco beans and rice.  I asked for chile con carne on my enchiladas and they came with red enchilada sauce.   No chile or carne there.  The crispy beef taco was the only thing seasoned well.  Sadly  no puffy taco available. The beans and rice were ok but nothing to speak of.  We asked for flour tortillas and were charged  1.    They were hot and freshly made by a lady we could see working in the kitchen so we had high expectations and these were very similar to an unsalted cracker. So  we won t be returning to Flores Mexican food as it is nothing like what I was expecting.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,140,Ordered a to go order for my son and when I got there  the lady was so rude and snarky. When I asked for chips and salsa she snapped at me about it being a kids meal     I don t know about her  but my son loves his tortilla chips. Not sure why it makes a difference since he d be eating them there  had we stayed.  The food is good  but the service  not so much
Flores Mexican Restaurant,141,Well looks like growth has killed another place that used to be good. Went to the new Wm Cannon location of Flores Restaurant for lunch  and while the old location was small  at least the food was good and the service excellent. The new place is pretty  but the food was extremely bland  service blas   and the presentation sadly lacking.   The  chips  were fried tortilla halves  not chips  and about half the basket was chucks of tortillas that were stuck together. The queso was just cheese  no peppers  onions  tomatoes  nothing but melted cheese. My taco looked like it was thrown at the plate and had no flavor. My wife had  fajita  nachos but the beef had nothing in common with fajitas. It was dry and flavorless.   I guess growth has made it impossible for them to keep up with quality. I got the distinct feeling from our server that she would have preferred not to have any guests today. It was just too much trouble to be friendly  or to make sure we had what we needed. If she could have thrown our food from across the room and saved herself the walk she might have done it. There are way too many good Mexican restaurants in this town to go back to one so indifferent.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,142,Came here to enjoy the fajitas  got shrimp and was pleased with my experience. The manager Eric did an extremely good job  bringing a fine dining experience to a cheaper yet high quality restaurant.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,143,Four stars for parents with little kiddos. The tables are so close to the playscape you can truly drink your margarita and supervise. The food isn t great - but we don t come for the food. We come to drink and relax while our kids roam and play. Service is hit or miss - mostly bc there are so many families doing the same thing  but we just don t care. One of the best bar restaurant play set ups in Austin.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,144,Flores is in my hood now. We were totally anticipating this for months while it was being built.  It s always ALWAYS slammed here. The food is nothing exciting  and flavorless. A to-go order is almost always wrong  and the hectic  disorganized atmosphere is hard to eat in.  Sorry Flores. We tried.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,145,We were seated right away  although the parking lot looked full. We were greeted right away by our servers and drinks arrived quickly. I had the chicken fajitas which were delish. Plenty of veggies and chicken which was flavored and cooked accordingly. On a separate plate was guacamole  sour cream  cheese  lettuce and tomato. All crisp fresh and yummy. The only thing that was kind of bland was the rice  they can definitely improve that. We would return. My husband had the three enchiladas and said it was very good. Worth a shot in my opinion.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,146,Never disappointed  The food is always so delicious and the drinks cannot be more on point  Skinny Margaritas are perfect. Frozen Florina Margarita  specialty drink  is pretty tasty as well. The people are always so happy here  amp  the staff is very welcoming. Thank you Flores family for such a well put together establishment 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,147,Plain bland appetizers. I won t be going back but for maybe just for the Happy Hour drinks. Nice staff  amp  the bar service was good.  I was disappointed.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,148,Every time I go to Flores I m amazed at how good the food is. Tonight I got a chimchanga  and it was awesome. They drowned it in queso and it was still crispy  jus the way I like it. Isacc is my server most of the time and he makes me feel like I m more then a guest. The strawberry margarita is perfect. All around service was great.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,149,I ve been hearing a lot about Flores since their move to the William Cannon location. So  we hit it up tonight and I m sorry to say the service was the best part.   My wife had the mole chicken and it was void of flavor. I had the shrimp tacos and they were soggy on one side and flimsy on the other. Both kids had the kids burritos and they were average at best. The charro beans were really good.   The chips  which are usually a high point for any Mexican restaurant  were blah  but the salsa was good.   Luis was our waiter and he did a great job. Very attentive and quick to bring us anything we needed.   We re beginning to get a lot of options in SW Austin and we don t need another average Mexican restaurant. Flores also has Hecho En Mexico to compete with which has awesome  amp  unique central Mexican food.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,150,Not sure why this location has so few stars. you definitely wouldn t think so judging by the dozens and dozens of cars that take up nearly every parking space every night.   My parents are regulars here and I have joined them on many occasions. We have received nothing but excellent service  great tasting food and I really can t think of any complaints. The margaritas are amazing. I recommend the La Florita  its the best margarita I ve ever had hands down.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,151,Was told 4.50 margs and paid 6. Management sucks and the place is dirty and service is slow.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,152,This is equivalent to Taco Bell - nothing more.  The only redeeming quality is the playground for the kids.  The food is awful with no flavor or quality.  Hoping that decent service would make up for the horrible food but that s not the case.  The service is terrible - plain  amp  simple.  Sitting at the bar for over a hour with no interaction by the staff is unacceptable - especially when it s not even busy.  We had to ask for menus  ask for drinks  amp  beg for service.  It s a shame given we live in the neighborhood but I ll walk a little further for Chuy s which is above  amp  beyond this dump.   BTW - get your bar personnel together.  They are a disaster - standing around talking with each other while customers would like just a little attention.  I m all about supporting local businesses but not this place.  I ve tried multiple times but bye bye...
Flores Mexican Restaurant,153,AVOID     unless you aren t going to order food or drinks. I d rather have a  0.50 frozen dinner from HEB. I think that may be what this is.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,154,Best machacado in town. Great atmosphere. Favorite time to go is for brunch. The fresh made tortillas are AMAZING corn or flour. This is definitely a place everyone should try.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,155,Truly average Mexican food. Not super spicy or flavorful or memorable. The highlights of Flores are the great customer service and the outdoor playscape for kids. Although the food is as basic as it comes  I d come back for the kid s menu and outdoor playscape. Maybe.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,156,Excellent lunch specials  6.50. Wonderful flavor. Nothing was less than perfect  Including the strawberry margarita  -  I will return
Flores Mexican Restaurant,157,Microwaved canned or frozen foods thrown together without any thought or skill. Bad service and overly sweet drinks.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,158,It is a great restaurant for kids  because they have a playground out back  but it ends there. The service was terrible  the drinks were weak  and the food had zero flavor. For Tex-Mex not to have flavor almost seems impossible  but they made it possible.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,159,The manager  Gina  decided to close at 11 20 instead of midnight.  Even though there were 15  people sitting at the bar  the bartender said they were closed  amp  stools were flipped upside down.  Another couple was standing next to me  amp  complaining that they had just called  amp  were told they were open until midnight.  Terrible experience.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,160,If busy there is not a lot of room to wait. Our waiter and the food was slow  but what really stunk was the place is drafty. On a cold day when someone comes in the front door the whole place drops several degrees.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,161,Agree with many of these reviews. All I can say is that I have eaten here several times since they opened the new location. I used to eat at the old location multiple times a month and it was a favorite go-to place near my house. I m giving it 4stars because it is getting to be as good as the old location.   It has gone down hill since the new location opened but each time I go back it gets a little better. All menu items are the same. Took them a while to figure out the new ovens and plates to cook items properly  cheese not melted on the enchiladas first visit .   For those that love the old location  wait a few months and give it another try.   The new servers are not great. They are slow and not as friendly.   Tip  to go orders are always wrong and food does not travel well. Eat onsite and request the bar area tables  the service in there is much better.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,162,Worst place that we have eaten Mexican food at. I have had food at so many Mexican restaurant in the city and this is one of the last on the list.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,163,This place is underestimated  You HAVE to come here  I don t know why this place got low ratings. I m giving it a 5 star so it will go up. The salsa and chips is the BOMB. I got nachos and wow  so good. They used white cheese which is really good. I got a frozen margarita and it s worth every penny. I m coming back  I kept on didn t want to coming here cuz of the reviews. They are wrong  Come here and give it a try 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,164,I am a regular at Flores and I have to say that the service I received on Saturday 10 21 was amazing. We were greeted with a smile and all of our drinks came so fast  thanks Amy and Luis  We had Floritas  amaZIng The managers  Eric and Jeana even came around and talked to us to make sure we were doing ok. So  if you have a free Saturday I recommend Flores 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,165,Seriously how a 3   The first time i went to flores you could smell the fajitas.  So thats what we ordered and you cant go wrong.  The steak and shrimp is so good.  The chips are addictive  drinks are good  the playgrounds are epic and the bar usually has your favorite sports on.  Plenty of parking and seating.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,166,Great value for the price  strong service most of the time. I love their fajitas plate.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,167,Love Flores    Food is great and the drinks are amazing   The wait staff are some of the friendliest people you will ever meet 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,168,So much wasted potential  Pretty building  beautiful patio  sweet servers  great faux Riviera mural  but plates of food served straight and unadulterated from cans.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,169,My husband and I tried Flores for the first time last weekend. It s was OK. Nothing special. There are several Mexican restaurants around the area that are better. We ordered the guacamole completo which was good and the stuffed jalape os as appetizers. We could tell the stuffed jalape os where frozen and not made there which was disappointing. The stuffed jalape os also had a salad in the middle of the plate which we found  odd. I ve never seen them served with a salad in the middle. I guess it was more of a filler. For dinner we ordered the Camerone s Calientes and the shrimp tacos.   I ll start with the Camerone s Calientes. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and were very large. The veggies barely touched a frying pan. They were coated with oil but raw. Not what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant considering the menu says grilled vegetables. The quest chip was a hard taco shell merely broken in half and put on the plate. I m not sure why it was even there. The cheese flauta was more of an enchilada. The rice was cold and could tell it was not fresh. It was clumped together. The charro beans were just OK.   Now the shrimp tacos. The corn tortillas fell apart the moment I tried to pick it up to eat it. I ended up discarding it. The shrimp were cooked nicely. The pico was old. The tomatoes were mushy and the cilantro was wilted. I pushed it to the side. The rice again was not fresh. The black beans where slightly under cooked. They had a bite to them. The chipotle cream sauce was very heavy on the mayo. I didn t taste the chipotle at all. The service was ok. The waiter was very attentive at first and then we didn t see him for a while. The restaurant was not busy for a Sunday evening. We mostly like would not go back.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,170,The only reason I gave this a 3 was because of their park and okay food. Much like many other mothers we go to enjoy ourselves while allowing the kids to play in there playground. It was 2pm on a Friday the restaurant was DEAD I came through the back since I didn t want to interrupt the people eating with screams from my two year old wanting to go to the  park .  I saw a waiter about 4x and never once did he ask if I would like a glass of water or a menu. I didn t mind that so much just thought it was rude  what was really upsetting was a resting witch face as a bartender. She seemed pretty annoyed that I would go walk up to her and ask for a beer and two ice creams. Someone should really show her how to be more friendlier. I drank my beer and brought the dishes and beer glass back inside placed in front of her   without a thank you . I gave a 3 because I usually get very sweet waiters and waitresses. This just shows how one bad seed can ruin things for the rest.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,171,We were big fans of the location on 290 and William Cannon. New location features larger building with more seating  full u-shaped bar  tv s everywhere  and a kids play area outside. Over all  our first visit to the new location was an ok experience. The food was great  but the service was lacking. Signs all over the place advertising job openings suggest they may be understaffed. This could have been then reason we waiting longer times for drinks and food. I like the new place though and will be back  maybe they will work out the kinks in the service soon 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,172,Great family place.  Portions are huge.  Food is excellent.  Prices are fair.  Not sure what else there is to say.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,173,This is not even close to Mexican food it has no spices or flavor. The taco shells are store bought and the rice is insta rice. I would not recommend this to anyone. Why make homemade flour tortillas if your not going to fry your own corn tortillas.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,174,Nothing special.  Chips were light  salsa was okay  but everything was mediocre.  I would probably only go back if a friend really wanted to  but I don t think any of my friends would really want to.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,175,I ve tried this place twice now. The food has no flavor or spice what so ever. Even the sides were bad. I tried the Chicken fajitas and the chicken tacos. Go here if you like white people Mexican food
Flores Mexican Restaurant,176,I ve never felt so helpless in my life. My 4yr old son orders chicken tenders at Flores Mexican Restaurant. And he gets raw chicken not pink...raw    And their response was   I knew we should of microwaved it longer . Said the Manager  What the Fu  amp  is that   We didn t microwave it longer   You ve got to be kidding  me. So let s see how strong social media is...Anyone want to go to the Wm Cannon location so your kids can get salmonella     To the manager yeah you mam. Your restaurant manages you...step it up  And manage it  It takes courage. And I m challenging you...  Sucks cause Yelp makes you still put a star  So undeserving of it   Health Department will be called in the morning 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,177,I work very near by and attend lunch at Flores often. In the recent experiences my visit has not been very pleasant. Today I ordered the crisp taco and chalupa plate. What is suppose to be a hard shell tortilla was very soft  wet  and tore apart as soon as I tried to eat it. It seems as if the cooking staff forgot to drain the ground beef. I have never eaten a chalupa or crispy taco with a knife and fork. The waitress wasn t very attentive to us either.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,178,The meals were great but the soggy  greasy chips and the horrid service gets this place one star. While trying to enjoy a nice evening with my dad  I ordered the chicken burrito  comes with tomatillo sauce  however received the steak burrito  comes with Tex mex sauce . Not a huge deal  I assumed some sort of innocent mistake was made so I brought it up and asked for the correct meal. 5 minutes later somebody else  I assume the manager - they never introduced themselves  came by with the exact same plate I had just sent back and tried to give it to me. I told the man no  and that  again  I had ordered the chicken burrito so he  seeming pretty confused  took it back. Within less than a minute he brought back the same plate and said  hey this IS a chicken burrito  but I had pointed out that there s Tex Mex sauce and chunks of beef all over it to which he quickly interrupted and said  no  I just cut it open and there s chicken . I quickly replied  a bit agitated at this point  that the chicken burrito comes with tomatillo sauce and doesn t have chunks of beef all over it and to please just get me whatever is on the menu  because that s what I ordered . The guy interrupted again and asked   so you just want a different sauce   to which I again  actually mad and mildly confused about why this is even happening in the first place  said  NO  I just want what s on the MENU  so he then just left without a word and my original waitress quickly brought out the correct meal. The meals were great  We were quite surprised because last time we went the food was awful - unfortunately the bad taste that was left in my mouth after the interaction with the gentleman  which we received zero apology or acknowledgement  completely ruined my mood and I wasn t able to eat much. Oh well - that s what leftovers and Yelp is for  
Flores Mexican Restaurant,179,The bar is a great place to bring screaming  rambunctious  misbehaving children and have the management do nothing. Also really good to receive poor service and have a manager say to your face they will make it right but actually do nothing. Enjoy 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,180,The food has really gone down hill.. not even half as good as it used to be. And they do not allow dogs in the outside eating area  which we found out AFTER we had already ordered our food and by a very rude and unreasonable woman who I m assuming was the manager. We ended up having to take our food to go. Beware  you will not find the dog lovin friendly Austin vibe here  What a shame..
Flores Mexican Restaurant,181,One star for excellent service  Food is another story. Ordered the simplest of Mexican entrees- crispy beef tacos and crispy chicken tacos. Beef had no seasoning - it was just boiled ground beef. chicken was also not seasoned just boiled. Refried  beans - no seasoning. Hot sauce was good as usual. On the fence about wether or not we will come back. Pricing is great and they are close to our house but food is bland.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,182,Avoid this place  the bartenders are weak. I sat at the bar and waited 5 mins. without an offer to get a drink.  I had to call out to one even though i was sitting at the bar.  It went downhill from there.  Poor service and rude bartender.  The manager even acknowledged that and offered to buy us several rounds.  Too late I will never go somewhere where the bar staff thinks they are more important then the people they serve.  That s why it called SERVICE some bartenders  just don t get it.  With all the great places to eat and drink in Austin just avoid this one cause it is not so great in fact ever time i have been there it was a bad experience.  So don t go to this place unless you like to be insulted by the staff.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,183,First off the place looks good. Second the staff were very nice. But when we went it was very warm  where we thought we were going through menopause early  The waitress said the air conditioner was not working. We ordered the queso and it was super bland it was just cheese w jalape os in it. My carne guisada was not all that either. My friend ordered the enchiladas and when she got her food it was not hot  it was room temperature.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,184,Found this place while traveling. Place was clean  Food was very fresh and tasty  service was quick and friendly.  Chips and salsa served with breakfast can t beat that.  Very reasonably priced.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,185,Walked in to three young hostesses.  I greeted them and noticed two of the three girls had impeccable resting bitch faces  not a particularly warm welcome . The wait wasn t long before we were being escorted to our table.  The high chair they brought was REALLY dirty   I went back and asked if one of the young ladies could please clean it.  She came back with a dry napkin and swept it over the chair   missing every piece of food left IN the chair.  We took care of it and quickly placed or drink app order. The waitress was very sweet and friendly.  Very accommodating. Food was good and the tortillas made up for any previous qualm. I d go back and over indulge in the homemade tortillas anytime.  I didn t order any last night but all the cocktails I saw looked delicious.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,186,The place is beautiful but the food is not great. I had fajitas that were way to greasy and over cooked. My husband had chicken fajita chili renello that had no flavor at all. The rice and beans tasted like nothing. Our taste buds were screaming for some flavor. Two stars for friendly service and ok chips and salsa.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,187,Well  walking in and seeing a dining room full of senior citizens and small children SHOULD have tipped me off to how bland the food was going to be  but we opted to stay and try it out.  The chips were fresh and salsa great so initially we thought this might be our new go to tex mex in SW Austin. Additionally  they had really terrific drink specials. In fact  I think I d be willing to go back for drinks and chips and salsa. So really I d like to give this a 2.5 star rather than 2 for the fresh chips and salsa and the very reasonably priced alcohol.  When the queso came it was the blandest we ve ever had even with guacamole and beef added. There were no chilis  no flavor  no nothing  just strait velveeta. Then came the entrees. My son had Shrimp Diablo enchiladas which he said were pretty unremarkable. I had a chicken chalupa with  spiced  chicken that had no flavor and the refried beans were watery and heavy on lard  light on flavor. My husband had chicken enchiladas with verde sauce which he thought were  decent  I scooped some of his excess verde and put in on my chalupa which helped.   The interior is nice BUT there are TV s everywhere in the dining room. We were interested in an evening out to dinner not going to a sports bar. This aspect could be an added feature depending on a diner s perspective  but to us it detracted from the experience.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,188,We had a wonderful meal today and the food and service was fantastic. Absolutely love love the margaritas.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,189,I ate there for lunch a week ago. It was marginal. I decided to go give them another shot for Happy Hour. I called at 6 00 to see when Happy Hour ended and they said 7 00. I get there and they tell me it ends at 6 00. I explain that I just called and a woman who seemed to be a manager gave me an attitude as if I did something wrong. This was horrible customer service. I won t be back 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,190,Very bad service went there today with 10 of us and the waitress refused to take care of us   The manager was on her personal cells phone.. So we got up and left   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,191,Not sure why I am taking the time to provide feedback on flores.  i was a customer for as long as the original one was opened in Oak Hill maybe 17 years ago.  My family and I ate at that location for at least once a week and we spent nearly every Friday there at happy hour for a number of years once our kids were old enough to stay at home alone.  After a string of inconsistent food  uncaring management  and a high turnover in servers we finally stopped going.  I  will say even during the bad experiences the La Flore margarita and the queso was always outstanding.  We decided to try the new upscale location at William Canon and Brush Country.   The experience was bad.  Food was bland and prepared poorly.  The queso was different  too much American Cheese in it  it tasted like Velveeta   the La Flore had too much orange juice in it.  2 of us ordered chimichangas.  Both of these had so much liquid in them and they had sat inside the burrito so long that the tortilla turned doughy.  The outside was beautifully crusted but the inside tasted like a raw biscuit.  i ate about 1 4 of it.  The server asked about it and i explained it wasnt good and for the reason.  The other person at the table ate maybe a 1 3 is his as he could not eat it either.  It was rather gross.  Two of the other people with us had soup  and both of the ladies asked for something slightly different with the tortilla soup.  One asked for little chicken  as she doesnt like meat  much  the other asked for no cheese.  Neither of these requests were honored.  The manager came out and apologized and asked if they could make something else  to which I declined.  I was not surprised that the chimichangas were on the bill as that is what I have become accustomed to by them over the past several years  The experience was bad and sad.  After 17 years or so and many good memories  I will never go back.  I hope they try harder  I hope they dial in on customer service and the importance of keeping repeat customers.   There are only so many customers in this area and there are many better mexican food experiences to be had.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,192,This was my second visit to the restaurant. The first visit was with a large group. On our first visit we had to remind them that children meals came with ice cream and they made us wait 30 mins for the ice cream. Couldn t complain as they brought ice cream for a child who didn t order the meal. Today was a bad experience. Went with my 5 year old. The server was very hospitable. Ordered crispy taco for my child and specified only lettuce  cheese and sour cream. He brought it with beef filling. I requested to replace it as we don t eat beef. He went in and brought the same plate with just 1 taco this time instead of 2 and had just removed the beef. Had to call for server again and showed him the beef pieces inside taco and he said if we still wanted it. Takes it back and brings it in the same plate with the new single taco and the meat stuck all over the plate. Again asked for the ice cream which came with the meal.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,193,For the second and  LAST TIME  in a month  we visited the Flores Mexican Restaurant location on William Cannon - what disaster         It took over and hour and fifteen minutes to get part of our order  with the 2 children s order arriving 10 and 15 minutes later - WOW   - one would think the children s orders would come out first       After three attempts of delivering our food  with other peoples orders mixed in  the food arrived cold and some of it not fit to eat.  The excuse used by the manager was  the Austin water issues  - definitely wondering how that is possible for cold  unedible food      We had brought in our out of town guests - so sad        Also  the service was less than desirable   Our previous experience at this location  about a month ago  was so bad with the staff closing up tables and putting the chairs on top of the tables all around us over one and half hours prior to closing  in addition to everything we ordered was incorrect.  Finally  the waitress left a dirty  saturated towel on the table  beside my food.  We hoped this incident was just a fluke since this restaurant is in our neighborhood  however  after our experience on Sunday  we will never go again.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,194,Not the best place. Its gone down hill over the years. Wilted salad obviously let over from the day before. Any respectable restaurant cuts their salad veggies daily. The crispy taco I had was full. For what it was it was good. As stay away from the barracho beans  charro  beans. They were very cloudy and flavorless. Ill give them this the service was professional and courteous. One thing I for got to mention. The rice tastes exactly like el patio frozen dinner rice. Just sayin.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,195,Walked in and was seated and given chips and salsa immediately  Then everything went down hill from there waited 10-15 minutes and no one ever came by to take our drink order or even acknowledged us and would be with us shortly. We left and will never go back 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,196,This Flores is full of happy employees and Great Tex Mex style Mexican food.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with tomatillo say a and it was Purrfecto   Also the margarita Flor was great also.  And if you want to speak Spanish everyone is buzzing en Espanol   Vamanos ahora 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,197,My friends and I were looking to get some Mexican food for dinner after a long day at the pool. We looked it up and this was the closest one to us. When we walked in  no one greeted us at first. The hostess then walked over from doing silverware and took us to a booth.  She was very nice and friendly  Our server was friendly at first and offered to take our drink order. While we were munching on chips and salsa  my friend ran out of water. We put it at the end of the table so they could see it thinking that they would just come by and fill it up. About 10 minutes had gone by and they did not. They seemed to be more interested in their own conversations at the server s station than paying customers. I had to get up and go over to our waiter to ask him if we could get some more water. He then apologized and got us more water right away. The whole time we were waiting for more chips and water I saw maybe about 15 employees going in and out of the bathrooms instead of helping customers. I mean what are they even doing in there  And I saw no one going around to check on their tables to see how they were doing. When our waiter finally came by to take our order we had told him chicken fajitas with no vegetables. When the order arrived the refried beans were not brown but gray and our fajitas had vegetables. In the end we gave our server a small tip and I wrote on the recipe that he needs to work on his attentiveness and that he got our order wrong. I think they just didn t make us a priority because we were younger and we  didn t know any better . I work in the restaurant industry and I know this is not how things are supposed to run. Next time my friends and I will make the drive to somewhere far away from this restaurant 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,198,Sydney was by far the worst waitress we have ever had. She could not give a recommendation when we asked  it being our first and now last time going there. She brought our check when we were half way through our meal and still eating. She did not ask if we wanted anything else. Then when my boyfriend asked for another beer she rolled her eyes and walked away. Only to come back and say they were out of beer  which neither of us believed. All in all mediocre at best food and by far the worst waitress I have ever had. Do not recommend  would give zero stars if I could.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,199,First time I went with my wife they had barely opened up so our experience was slow horrible service our drinks took 20 minutes to get to us the food even longer.....understandable they barely opened up. Went there last night 4 27 15 this time mediocre service  watery queso  just ok flautas in which I feel like I could ve gotten better at taco cabana. Oh yeah and how could I forget my watered down beer rita in which I asked my server to replace it she got argumentive and treated me like it was my first time having one but she eventually replaced it and brought me a better one.To sum it up if you want quality tex mex go somewhere else and do not go to Flores because you will be disappointed.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,200,I was excited to see a new restaurant in the neighborhood. We were hoping it was like Rosa s which is a fast food chain. It is a sit down restaurant . The service was fast until it came time for the check we were ready to get up and walk out.  I will start with the food the chips were not that great the salsa was way too spicy to enjoy .I got the beef fajita nachos the meat was overcooked greasy and they weren t really like the nachos you would expect . The were flat on the plate. The shrimp cocktail was good. My son got the beef crispy tacos  shouldn t be that hard to screw up but they were plain and bland and the show was very thin. We were not impressed with the food will never go back first paying  30 for the three items that we had and didn t even eat. we took the food home as leftovers but will probably end up feeding it to the dogs. being originally from Arizona where you have real Mexican food this was hard to digest.  I would have to say it s the worst Mexican food I ve had since I have been here in Austin. We should have drove the extra 15 minutes to Rosa s cafe which is a 100  better than this place. Just saying  you wanted honesty.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,201,I live in the neighborhood so after watching it be built  I wanted to try the place.  The family and went  in on a Thursday night and we sat in the  sports bar . We were seated immediately.   I can tell a lot about a Mexico restaurant by their salsa which was good and spicy.  I was with my family and we each ordered our  favorites   things that we like other places   and each of us loved our choice and even sampled each others  entrees.  The service was exceptional   The portions were large enough for  left-overs  and the prices were more than reasonable.  We even ordered  to-go  a few nights later.  The only reason I didn t give it  5 stars   I m not impressed with the tortillas.  I ve had better and they don t reheat well.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,202,Used to go to the old Flores at the Y in Oak Hill and always loved the food  amp  service  but was bummed at the wait times.  Happy to report that the new location at Arbor Trails is a bonafide winner.  Same great food  had the queso  chimi with fajita chicken   nachos   same strong drinks  great service  table of 8 with four kids  waiter was perfect   much better location.  Easy parking  lots of room  and what looked to be a great bar  that s for next time .  Way to go Flores 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,203,Flores new restaurant is great. I like the Joes tacos which is just a smaller plate of fajitas but with plenty of fixins and I usually take home one of the two tacos. I like all of their enchiladas. The chips and hot sauce are great but sometimes the sauce is a little too hot for me and my date. I never forget to order corn tortillas on the side and they make there as you can see when you walk in. they have a friendly staff good happy hour specials and very pleasant surroundings in their new building. just don t go during peak hours unless you are prepared to wait. Possibly my favorite Mexican food place in town.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,204,This place is pretty good. We ve had nice and friendly service the few times we have been here and they bring the chips and salsa pretty quickly which is something I am picky about so I like that a lot. The chips and salsa are really good but I do wish they had a slightly more mild salsa option in addition to the one they have. I have a nice time here it s pretty laid back compared to other places close by. Good food good service nice atmosphere what more are you looking for 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,205,Great food. Great service. We ve been going to Flores  for 15 years. Always had great food and drinks at the original location in Oak Hill. The first couple of times we came to the new location  things were a bit slower than we expected. But they have done a nice job of working out the kinks. Last couple of times we have gone  it is been like old times.  They have a good menu  with lots of options  and they pay a lot of attention to detail. The staff is friendly  as are the bartenders. Highly recommend it. If you went a month or two ago  and were a little disappointed  I d encourage you to give it another chance.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,206,Lets begin with  the food was mediocre and the service was absolutely terrible. The salsa was about the only phenomenal dish we had  amp  it was free. The queso was extremely bland and lacked any kind of real taste. My husband seemed to enjoy his enchilada  but the taco that came with it looked like it was thrown together by a toddler. My shrimp tacos were not awful  they had flavor and the tortillas were great  but they were not at all extrodinary by any means. Durina immediately showed a lack of interest in our table- every other table she was taking care of seemed to hold more monetary value. She was also extremely unprofessional with kissing her boyfriend as he sat down and ignoring the needs of other tables- I had to interrupt to get my drink to go. I would not waste time or money- I m sure there are tons of better Mexican restaurants around  amp  we will be visiting those from now on.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,207,We just moved from so cal and wanted Mexican food. We read the reviews but decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately this will be our first and only time. While service was good  the food was bland. I never understand how a Mexican restaurant s chips and salsa can be so bad. My side taco was worse than Taco Bell. Again  service was good and restaurant was clean but food was terrible in our opnion. My suggestion to the restaurant would be to cook with flavor.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,208,I ve been coming to the oak hill location since the late 90 s  when it was still at the y  and it s been a constant favorite. There s nothing I ve tried that I don t like. And I m addicted to the chips and salsa. Did I mention their margaritas   Yum. Only downside is sometimes the service is lacking or flat out rude. Sometimes it s awesome  lately it s been great. But  either way  I keep coming back cause the food is just too good   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,209,Let me first say that I love Flores Restaurant.  Great staff  great dishes  wonderful recipes  and tons of loyal customers. I love the mole  carne con chile verde  chipotle sauce  pollo caliente  and enchiladas.  Some of the less favorable Yelp  Reviews are way off base  IMHO. But let me talk more about the mole sauce  there s plenty of mole recipes in austin and I ve tried many them. I m a fan of Flores  family recipe...it reminds me of my own mother s mole recipe  I put Flores mole recipe up against any other mole recipe around    The salsa verde and salsa chipotle are wonderful as well     I m enjoying some salsa chipotle as I write this review   the bar staff are second to none. Ronnie  Blanca  Kiley  Ryan  Angel  and the rest really take good of you. They are the Best    Give Flores a try and you ll see that they are a great place for dinner with family or to have a couple of drinks with friends. Flores gets it right    Boom    
Flores Mexican Restaurant,210,Unfortunately  ever since the management changed a couple of years ago  the food and service at the 290 location has taken a turn for the worse. As a result  our family rarely eats here anymore. Maybe we will try the new location on Wm. Cannon but it s farther from home so we probably won t go often. Now we are at a loss for good Tex Mex near Dripping Springs. We miss you  Flores 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,211,Do you like margaritas  Do you like Tex-mex food  Do you like friendly staff  Do you have children who like to run around   Do you live south  You re f amp  cking up if you re not coming here.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,212,Our family s FAVORITE Mexican restaurant by far   Flores takes pride in margaritas  as it should  but I must say they have the BEST flour tortillas and the BEST refried beans in Austin.  I really appreciate how the staff at Flores takes care that my son s food allergies are considered in all of their food preparations for him.  Wonderful staff  quality food.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,213,I thought I d miss the old location in Oak Hill  but the new William Cannon location has really impressed. The food  service and new bar are exemplary    If you re really lucky  you might end up with Aron as your server. Aron is not only a great person  but a marketing gem for Flores. You can tell he loves working there and that he loves people. This is one of my new go to spots      
Flores Mexican Restaurant,214,Think sit down Taco Bell... I ordered the tortilla soup as an appetizer   and it succeeded at removing my appetite.  Next came the entree where the greyish refried beans and the chewy rice made me really sad.  When the waiter asked how the food was I told him it was mediocre   he laughed and we only saw him again when he brought us the check.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,215,Amazing place the bar is really big with a lot of TV s  if you want good fajitas this is the place  la florita margarita 100  agave for that price  awesome  Congrats  For this new location 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,216,This place rocks  First off if you are not opposed to having TV s everywhere you re in the right place. Secondly sit in the bar area  They have a good environment along with friendly Staff currently. Ronnie  Ryan  Blanca  Diana  Miranda  Oscar and JP all have been our servers and without a doubt make the experience worth it. Fajitas are great and my favorite is the Fish Tacos with a Mexican Martini  If you know the Secret Menu order from it    
Flores Mexican Restaurant,217,One star for getting our food to the table super fast  otherwise low quality bland food at high prices. Tres Leches awful. No one minds cheap food from a hole in the wall place  that s why you go there. But if you want to look like and play with the big boys  you better upgrade your food and service to match 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,218,I come to Flores because they know what I like. I am recognized. I feel like a member of the family. I drink the Skinny margarita and it is so good. I would recommend anybody to come here. The food always comes hot and fast. After a long week I look forward to a nice drink and a great time at Flores.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,219,food was average Mexican fare...service was mediocre...drinks were overpriced...Mexican martini was  13 and bottle of beer was  5.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,220,The bar staff and management have changed for the worst since it open    many regulars have abandon this Happy Hour. What a shame    
Flores Mexican Restaurant,221,Absolutely horrible. The food is terrible  service was bad. I don t know how they call this mexican food. You couldn t pay me to eat here again.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,222,The manager refused to honor our Flores Gift Card with a  40 balance that we had never used and that showed a  0 balance in their system. We have been loyal customers for years but this experience means they will never have our business again. When I told the manager this he shrugged his shoulders and asked me to pay the  14 tab.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,223,Zero stars    I ve waited to write this to make sure I didn t write out of anger. My families experience at this location was the worst service I have ever experienced. We took our girl for dinner on Cinco de Mayo. It. Was. Crazy. Nothing we didn t expect though. After waiting   not an unreasonable amount of time we were seated and ordered queso  which was quickly brought. Then nothing happened. No chips to eat our queso... Nothing. They finally arrive then we wait another 20 to 30 minutes for a waiter to take out order. I finally go speak to the manager who explains there was a shift change and apologized that we got lost in the shuffle. We order and wait another 20 to 30 minutes  no food. Now by this time there are several empty table  even if they were full  there should have been enough staff to cover the influx of cinco de mayo customers. I once again approach the manager  get an apology and food is delivered shortly after. We eat and wait an unacceptable amount of time for our check. Once again I have to seek out the manager. She s apologetic again. She offered free dessert. Service has already proved unreliable  I m not about to wait around for dessert. I tell the manager id rather not have to pay for our dinner. This was not an unreasonable request  given I had to find her to get every part of our dinner taken care of. She said that s not something she does  not rudely  just a complete in willingness to make the situation right. It was truly disappointing.   Flores is so close to our house  has an amazing playground and play area. We would have frequented often. But now  I m left with utter disgust that the manager was completely unwilling to take responsibility.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,224,Wanting to give more stars. Beautiful building  I m sure the food is good  but the bartender needs to be more attentive. More bartender-ish. Having get the attention of the bartender is not something one should have to do. Then they screwed up our bill and it took another 10 minutes for them to figure it out. Adjustments. It s good they re here  but they need a few tweaks.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,225,The  decor and atmosphere is new and clean  but my food was old and tasteless.  I had the cheese enchiladas - cheese was cold and bland - and a crispy beef taco - the beef was overly seasoned  gray chunks in a slightly stale taco shell.  Overall  not a pleasant experience.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,226,Great queso. Great margaritas- I m curious as to why  of all the  top shelf  margaritas  only one is served frozen. And the chimichanga was excellent.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,227,We re serious regulars to this restaurant  Very good hot sauce  Muy picante  Joe s tacos or lunch Joe s taco s my husband s fave. Charro beans-great. Always good  always fresh  always nice environment. Great value. Some things may be a little too authentic for some. Caldo is broth only. This is my go-to diet meal 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,228,My far the best margarita  La Flor  that s priced right   8.50   LOVE the beef fajitas and get the  5 lunch special   7.49  almost every time.  The salsa is the best in town  hands down. I think they ve won the salsa festival a few times  your think they would be marketing that .  The hostess  while I m sure is a lovely girl  is not hostess material. Would a greeting  smile or not acting put out while seating me kill her   There are some bad reviews here  but I ve been eating here and the one in Drippin for 11 years and have never had a bad meal. They always get my order correct and I m one of those who sees a menu as a list of ingredients to be put together how I like them.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,229,There is nothing Authentic about their Mexican food.  Everything was pretty tasteless.  Dont waste your time or money here. You will be disappointed.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,230,I been a regular at Flores for 5 years the service it s always fantastic   Food it s always the best  my favorite plate is the POLLO CALIENTE    yummy so delicious with charro beans I like to ask for there famous home made tortillas. There drinks are the bomb I love LA FLORITA   it comes in a pint glass frozen with a floater of grand marnier  amp  Cazadores tequila. All there stuff it s awesome I like to sit at the bar with my favorites bartender Blanca  Ymer and some of the new guys there all great   but lately I sit at a table because we have a new born    but the service drinks everything it s great   I love coming to Flores at least twice a week  Sometimes more   I love the new location it s so beautiful   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,231,Great food  great drinks  and a place for my child to play...exactly what we were looking for.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,232,POISON IVY IN THE PLAYGROUND  Just finished washing the poison ivy off my screaming five year old. To make matters even worse  when I returned to speak to the manager on duty  she tells me they re aware of it but they just can t get it under control. Do you think for a second that my son who is covered from head to knees with huge red welts cares about how hard it is to get it under control  YOU PUT UP A SIGN TO WARN OTHER PARENTS OR YOU SHUT IT DOWN  Pissed off is an understatement  Flores you better make a move or I will.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,233,Atmosphere was nice.  Family friendly with playground.  Food was comparable to Taco Cabana  just higher priced.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,234,Not sure if something has changed since December  but went for lunch yesterday and was so disappointed.  Chips were brown burnt  asked for more and got a basket with same kind with a few good chips.  LaFlora was horrible  not at all what I m used to there.  Soft taco tortillas were a cross between flour and corn and were not fresh.  We were weekly patrons but not sure if this is what to expect now.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,235,Since my husband has already called and spoke to a manager I will WARN everyone who goes to this establishment. First let me say we can NOT be 100 percent sure BUT we dined at this location on Feb. 11th. On Friday  Feb. 13th when my husband went to pay bills there was a  500.00  processing  fraudulent charge from my husbands debt card number on Feb. 12th in Chicago  IL. The bank said the number was manually put in to make this online purchase. Now we have NEVER used our debt card for ANY online purchases. I probably wouldn t even be writting this review had I not gone back to the bank yesterday and was told that another customer came in the same day I did  Feb. 13th  with the same type of fraud on their account and guess what we had in common     That s right the newest location on William Cannon for Flores Mexican Resturant     If you decide to dine here I suggest CASH.  The food was okay  we had the beef fajitas for two.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,236,I ll start with the positives. The waitress was very nice. The food was okay. Had 6 in our party and arrived at 7. They close at 10. There were only 2 other occupied tables. By about 7 15 we were the only people in the restaurant and the staff put all of the chairs up on the tables and began cleaning the restaurant. Our waitress came over and said not to worry about the cleaning as there would be open another 3 hours. Weird and fairly insanity. Fast forward to our order. Almost every plate was wrong. I have gluten allergies and ordered a gluten sensitive dish. It came wrapped in flour tortillas. The waitress commented how strange that was as that dish is noted as gluten free. Glad I noticed. She brought corn tortillas. Multiple times during our meal  different table bussers came and began clearing our table  including my children s plates that that they were actively eating off of. There was no way to think any of us were finished eating. Towards the end of the meal  several of us still eating  the busser came and cleared the entire table. Plates  drinks  everything  and she left her nasty dish rags on our table. She also began mopping the floor including under our table. This all happened before 8 30 pm. Not cool.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,237,I am reviewing the William Cannon location. I met friends for drinks in the bar on a Wednesday night. Fun atmosphere. Still fairly busy at 8 p.m. We sat at a table in the large bar room. Service was fine considering how busy it was. Server quickly asked if we wanted drinks and water.  He fairly quickly filled our orders and checked on us at intervals during our time there. My friends had the house margarita. I sipped it and it was really good....nice balance of alcohol to other ingredients. Not too strong or weak. I had an Alamos malbec for  8  pretty reasonable price. We also ordered the pork quesadilla and ceveche for the table. The quesadilla was good and the lettuce  tomatoes  guac and sour cream they serve with it was ample and fresh. The ceveche was not good. It was  9  which I felt to be a fair price if it were good. The menu said it was talapia. It also had bits of shrimp in it....I don t recall reading the menu well enough to see if the description noted that or not.  Basically it was bland and did not taste or look fresh. The fish did not have that awesome white appearance of freshly  lemon-cooked  fish. It was sort of grey. Also it was a bit tough or chewy  not flakey as I expected. The large tortilla chips served with it were stale. I instead tried to eat this dish with the chips delivered to our table with salsa..they were fresher. We left more than two thirds of this dish...a big waste of money. The chunks of fish were good sized but that is the only positive thing I have to say about this dish. I should not have ordered this dish here. I think ceveche is a more specialty item that must be prepared fresh each time it is ordered. I think this was either made from frozen fish or made many  many hours  even the day  before. I failed to tell the server or manager of my dissatisfaction because I was with friends and did not want to be  that customer.  I will give this establishment another chance.  I like the decor and location. Prices are reasonable. Atmosphere is fun...even though we were in the bar we could still talk. I will not order the ceveche here again.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,238,Really want to like this place. The drinks are good  the Queso is good and the ambience is good. Food lacks flavor and SERVICE SUCKS. Going there tonight with some friends to give it a second chance.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,239,The location is convenient for me.   The atmosphere is great  we sat by the bar  and there is a lot of TVs if you are in the mood for sport s bar experience.  I ordered a Skinny Margarita and it was very very strong  tasted like straight alcohol  I did not drink more than a 1 5 of it.  For dinner we had beef fajitas for 2  it was delicious   very fresh and thin tortillas  the portion is very well served  we had left overs for home.. I m rating it 3 stars because the service was not great and it took 30 minutes for our food to show up when the restaurant was not full at all..
Flores Mexican Restaurant,240,First timers to this place.  It has a children s outdoor playscape  so was main reason for the visit.  My 3 1 2 year old grandaughter was truely enjoying the playscape and running around  along with several young children.  Good food   reasonable cost. Driving back home  it was remembered that the ice cream included in our child s menu was not brought out. I gave it 3 stars due to it being a 1st time visit sampling of food and ice cream not brought out. Will probably return in the near future for the outdoor playscape fun.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,241,I ordered two beef tacos. They were the most tasteless beef tacos I have ever had. It was like the only thing they did was brown the beef and threw it in a shell. There was absolutely no spice of any kind in the beef. The rest of the group that I ate with did like their meals and the service was good.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,242,Okay  I ll start by saying this is a regular go-to place for our little group.  Normally  the service is decent and the food is pretty dang good.  However  on Saturday  January 6  we decided to go for a short visit.  At first  there were three of us and we sat at the bar.  We learned there would be one more and it s really hard for four people to visit in a linear situation.  I went to the front to request table seating which we received right away.  We closed out our tabs at the bar and moved to the table.  We sat at our table  received fresh chips and salsa...and then waited for approximately 20 minutes with empty glasses  closed menus  and no service.  We had to ask someone to send a waiter.  They apologized and said that since we had drinks  empty   and menus  closed   they thought we had a waiter.  We finally got to order and as usual  food was fine.  This is an unusual occurrence here but felt it needed to be addressed.  I will continue to go here but hope to avoid circumstances like this in the future.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,243,If you have young kids this is the place to go. They have a GREAT gated playground and yard for the kids to run around it. The food and service are good as well. I only wish they had tables outside you could order and eat at to be closer to your kids on the playscape  but they will happily seat you at a table near the window inside with a view of the playground. We have been here at least 5 times since finding it and it is our to go restaurant for the kids.  Also the first time we came my husband found some poison ivy out back and let the manager know. It was gone the next time we came. Great service. 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,244,Awesome restaurant  Breakfast is delicious   The new building is comfortable and enjoyable. Wife loves the happy hour margaritas 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,245,Best place ever.  Guys  they re building a dog park here and a playground.  What s not to love  The food is great   try the mixed fajita nachos  and the drinks are on point    try The Paloma and The Spicy Maria  the staff is so friendly and eager to please  The gorgeous bar is littered with TVs and Norma and Patricia make the best drinks  In short  this place meets All the criteria  good food  good drinks  family dog sports friendly  Check it out 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,246,Great food and fun atmosphere  Must try the  La Flor Margarita  It s amazing    Also have a bar area with tv s to watch your favorite game  Hoping they put in the patio area soon too 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,247,The food was as expected for  10-12 a plate.  Good enough.  My problem was the lack of cleanliness.  All knifes and forks i opened were grimy with fingerprint marks on them  and most utensils had dried bits of food on them that took some picking to get off.  the drink menu was greasy and had spots of food all over it.  The seats were oily due to oily foods being dropped on them  and not being wiped down.  I gave the utensils a good wipe down.  My wife said to ask for more  but i didn t like the idea of eating spit in my food when it came out so i dealt with it best i could.  I was there with my kids otherwise would have just left.  It was just too dirty and it was hard to enjoy sitting there let alone eat.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,248,Loved their food  not sure why they got 3 rating  loved Fajita s and Margaritas. Perfect date with my wife  can t ask for more  loved ambiance and spacious seating
Flores Mexican Restaurant,249,I visited the new location and can say it s awesome  The food was great service was good and drinks were on point. Will definitely be back.   
Flores Mexican Restaurant,250,I when today for lunch to the new Flores by william cannon and brush country and I had the best dinning experience ever  Food tasted fresh and delicious  they also have a big selection for margaritas  La Florita is a must try. They service is excellent  knowledgeable and friendly
Flores Mexican Restaurant,251,Just OK  but the seafood is WAY OVERPRICED for what it is. The shrimp tacos were not enjoyable to eat. The shrimp were pan saut ed and poured on to the tortillas which made the tortilla deteriorate and made the whole experience very messy.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,252,We decided to try this place and will not be returning. First off the waitresses do not know or understand the  English language  after getting our drinks  and not getting the extra lemons we specifically asked for  we stated we needed another minute. The place was not busy at all  there were at least 10 waitresses walking around  we asked one waitress  3 times  to please get our waitress and she either did not understand or didn t want to. We were ready to walk out when our waitress finally arrived. We overheard another table order some kind of beer and she  our waitress  couldn t understand the name of the beer. The guy repeated it several times and then the waitress stated they didn t have it and after several more exchanges in conversation finally got what he was ordering. Cheech  how can you not have what you can t understand   Food was average but my husband said the charro beans looked like they were in dishwater. We did not get our change  coin . I don t understand not giving us the correct change  do you not have money in the restaurant 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,253,There are so many Mexican restaurants that treat you like family.  Flores used to be that way  but not anymore.  We arrived tonight to mostly empty tables.  Yet we were told there was a wait because they were short staffed.  We were told we could sit in the bar area  but that area is now overrun with screaming kids  so we said we would prefer to be in the main dining area.  After 5 minutes the hostess said our table was ready and proceeded to try to sit us in the bar area we didn t want to be in.  She said she could not sit us in the main area even though it was mostly empty.  I then asked for the manager who rudely dumped us at a table in main dining area and left.  After a few minutes of seeing no one we decided to leave and received a cold and rude  have a nice night  from the receptionist.  We will not be back.  Something very bad is happening there and I am not sure why.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,254,Here s the thing  this is a new restaurant in one of the most coveted areas of one of the most coveted cities in the country right now.  Plus it has a playscape  an awesome one  by the way   which appeals to the trillion families that live nearby.  It s going to be busy.  And it is very  very  very busy.  Another yelper commented on the tables being too close together.  I ll agree with that but it dosen t bother me enough to stop going.  The food is good.  It s definitely not Mexican  don t go there expecting Polvo s because you ll be disappointed.  This is your standard meat cheese tortillas more meat more cheese Tex-Mex food.  That being said  the food is good   It s not great  but it s good.  I ve had the carne asada several times and it s been well-cooked and flavorful each time.  My husband is a huge fan of the carne guisada and the fresh  homemade tortillas.  The charro beans have a strange color and look unappealing but are actually excellent.  And the margaritas are stellar   I ve had several and this picky drinker has really liked all of them.  I m of the opinion that  for the most part  service depends on who you get and I guess I ve been lucky because I ve had good service each time.  We went once with a group of 10 on a busy Friday night and  though we waited an eternity for a table  our server was friendly and efficient  getting food  drinks  and checks out on time and correct in every detail.  I like this place 
Flores Mexican Restaurant,255,I was hopeful...my hope was quickly dashed. The bad started almost immediately. The hostess barely glanced up at us  grabbed a couple of menus and started walking away. We assumed that meant follow her. Then the chips came out. They likely were the leftover chips from a few days prior. They were stale and just awful. I guess that is one way to not overindulge in chips and salsa  I ordered a mojito as it was one of the drink specials. I was told I could not have one because they were out of mint. I ordered a chicken dish and asked if it was white meat chicken  I was told yes  me thinks  no . I am pretty sure I can tell the difference between white meat and dark meat. All in all  the food and service were both lacking. There are way too many other Mexican restaurants to go to in Austin to bother going back to this one.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,256,Yeah Wow  I don t understand any of these low rated reviews....The STAFF and the NEW PLACE are all AWESOME...   My wife and I can always find our way there for good food and drinks. The new place has plenty of dinning room with a spacious bar will lots of TV s for my sporting enjoyment. My personal favorite foods are the Pollo Caliente  Beef Enchiladas  Beef or Shrimp  amp  Fish Tacos  amp  the Carne Con Chile Verde... Oh yeah  the Queso Conpleto is another personal favorite while enjoying a Florita or cold beer at the bar with our favorite bartenders Ronnie  Blanca  amp  Kylie. All I can say is that my wife and I are always welcomed here with lots of friends and have met lots of new friends and have good experiences each and every time..........LOVE THIS PLACE    
Flores Mexican Restaurant,257,Avg at best.  I have eaten all of them and while its not bad  its nothing to brag about.  Chuys is tops.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,258,So we have been going to Flores for a long time at it s old location and love the La Flor.  We reThe food was good especially the fajitas. Oh and we love the waitresses waiters.  So we were really looking forward to the new Flores.  Been there 4 times since it opened.  We have had to wait longer times  this place is bigger than the old location  but the most disappointing is the cold food   I love that they have fresh tortillas but come on  cold food.  I ll give it another try but if no improvement they will be losing us as regulars.
Flores Mexican Restaurant,259,I feel compelled to write this review because this new location has come so far since it first opened.  My husband and I came here for breakfast the first week they opened in their new building on William Cannon.  We were very disappointed  due to poor service and very bland food.  I was wanting to badly to have a  go to  Tex-Mex  place in my neighborhood.  I didn t want to give up on Flores.  We went back a second time months later  and it had greatly improved.  The food  my husband had the steak fajita quesadillas  and I had the Twin s Plate  was so much better.  We went back again last night  and we were not disappointed.  We had the same two dishes and it was GREAT   Our server  Miguel  was TOP NOTCH    He was so professional and so friendly.  We will definitely ask for him again  as he made such a difference in our experience.  I m thinking that they just got off to a slow start because their kitchen wasn t  seasoned  yet and they just had to work out the kinks.  I m so glad to say that it s now my  go to  for Tex-Mex in SW Austin  
Flores Mexican Restaurant,260,Good service  waiter was attentive and fast. On the other hand  the food was not good. No flavor  too much cheap cheese on dishes  quality of steak questionable. Will probably not return..
Flores Mexican Restaurant,261,this place is awesome  dont let all the bad reviews keep you from trying this place out  and there margaritas are awesome 
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,1,This my first time here and it s by far the best food I ve eaten since moving here. Hands down i will be trying everything on the menu. The texture is great the sauce is crazy you can tell it s freshly made the same day very savory taste buds were dancing completely Loved it       You can beat believe bringing all my friends here more people need to know about DAYGOS big FACTS   
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,2,I have to leave a review because the carne asada is the best I ve ever had      We just moved from California to Georgetown  Texas in August this year  and after being in California since 1979 it is rare to find really good Mexican food here in Texas that compares to what we had there. You must try their food because it is killer      The carne asada is very tender  and has more flavor than any other I have tried   We had the carne asada street tacos  a carne asada quesadilla  California burrito  and the chicken rolled tacos.  Everything we ate was delicious     We will be going back again  
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,3,Was really excited about this place as I had delicious burritos in San Diego this past summer  but this place was a bit lack luster.  The flavors were good for the burrito  but the tortilla was tough and the meat was all right. I expected more from the surf and turf burrito as it was  16. The fries were more worth it as it was a boatload of deliciousness for  16.50. I liked the spicy green salsa a lot.  We ordered online for 1pm and it took 15 min longer to come out when we arrived. The food truck has a couple of tables next to it. It s in a food court with a couple other trucks that are interesting too  Cajun   African cuisine .  I think it d come again for the fries and maybe the tacos  but my overall experience was more like 3.5 5.
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,4,I needed a CA Burrito  was missing the west coast   and this gave me my fix. Next time  I m adding extra guac  sour cream  and asking for some extra crispy fries. None of that is needed on the burrito  I m just extra.  Nice to see a small sliver of SD in Austin. Also  got a Mamas Little Yella Pils at Oskar Blues to go with it
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,5,Food is pricey but SO GOOD  and with generous portions. This half-Mexican highly recommends it 
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,6,So I actually found this place when I was on uber eats. Well we all know how much extra that would of cost so seeing it was only 7 mins away  I took a drive. Wish I had placed an order earlier over the phone but was nice to chat with the owners. This is actually located in a lime green food truck that also sells shaved ice. The owners are from California so we had a nice little chat about being from San Diego and then I placed my orders of the California Burrito and the Daygos Fries. Mind you I haven t had a solid California burrito in years so this was definitely a treat    The burrito was filled with carne asada  fries  pico  guacamole  sour cream  and tons of cheese -- YUMMM  The fries were basically the burrito splayed open since it s the same ingredients but on top of fries. Honestly the fries tasted a lot better and I want to come back here to try the other burritos  Worth checking out   .
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,7,Yikes update  I was able to get it for  15 yesterday the carne sada fries but I checked today and it s now at 25 . 15 was overpriced as it is for a French fries meal but still obtainable  I could talk myself into spending 15  even carnesada fries in San Diego aren t 15  Jesus. 25 almost a 30 meal for French fries   Okay now it s out of the bounds of reality. Good luck   Okay so I didn t know this place was open yet  and finally saw it on Uber eats and one of the things I miss most about San Diego is the Mexican food and this is the closes you can get to it and it s actually good   I was so afraid. But I ate the whole thing. I am so so so happy there s something here to get my SD Mexican fix.
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,8,Absolutely AMAZING  We ordered the Daygo Fries with carne asada and let me tell you they were to die for. Fries were crunchy loaded with carne asada   shredded cheese  and all the fixings. Made our trip      A must try while visiting AUSTIN
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,9,Heaven for a 619 living in 512   Legit rolled tacos and other San Diego-specific Mexican food has arrived in Austin. Yes  there are other options around town but for a true rolled taco aficionado  first stop after landing at SAN and last stop before leaving  - this was perfection.   They are my go-to comfort food and have been for over 30 years.  Finding them in Austin was unsuccessful in almost 8 years of searching. I confess  - I haven t tried the burritos or nachos as yet but I plan to go back many many many times to explore.  Menu is not extensive but it doesn t need to be. Ordering on-line is super easy and setting at Oskar Blues Taproom was ideal.  We could feast and enjoy the brewery s hospitality   I am so happy Daygo s is here 
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,10,Food was good. Tried the carne asada fries and rolled tacos. Everything was good makes me miss San Diego
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,11,Absolutely amazing  The Carne Asada is marinated to perfection  no guacamole  salsa or even tortilla needed. It s THAT good. My family is from San Diego and the burritos over there cannot be replicated...until now. Now  some might be mad at me for saying this but  I actually prefer the 619 to my San Diego burritos..I said what I said. The rolled tacos were top notch and the best we ve had since our last visit to Oceanside  CA. The guac  salsa and sour cream all delicious. Dre  the owner is very hospitable and treated us like family. We will absolutely be back for many many years to come. Stop thinking about it and just go 
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,12,The best California burrito in town. Full stop. For years  I have been a loyal patron of Super Burrito  so when the guy at Daygo s started telling me that he had the best  San Diego  style California burrito I was skeptical. I ve been to San Diego several times and consider myself a burrito expert  grew up in Tucson . When it was all over  I had to agree that this was the best California Burrito in Austin. Confessed to the guy that I had been a diehard Super Burrito patron and told him he had won me over. The carne asada was perfect. Also loved the salsa roja. Will be back for sure 
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,13,Moved out from San Diego to Austin about 6 months ago. If their is one thing we ve been missing and looking for it is San Diego style Mexican food...... all due respect it is the best Mexican food in the U.S. That s just facts I didn t write the rules. My girl and I got the cali burritos and they were top tier 100  just like back home. Not to mention Andre had great hospitality and takes care of his customers. Highly recommend Daygo s to anyone. We Will most def be regulars.
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,14,Best San Diego style burritos in Austin.  The pollo asada reminds me of Roberto s from back home. Mac is a very kind owner and uses fresh produce everyday. The carne asada fries are . The 619 burrito the carne asada is on point.
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,15,Great place to eat. Food is outstanding. I would definitely recommend checking g out this place to eat.  It s  well worth it.  They also give you big serving size  I couldn t finish eating everything.  But it s so good you will not want to stop eating.  Great folks  food  and atmosphere.
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,16,Crazy that the best Mexican food in Austin is a San Diego style Mexican food place. But it is  My man Dre gets DOWN  Cali burro on point 
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,17,The carne asada is great  I ve had the tacos  the Daygo tacos  and the quesadilla. All were excellent  but the quesadilla was mind-blowing. Prices are high  but the meals are huge.
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,18,Really glad we have some real San Diego Mexican food in Austin  The carne asada fries were great  Carne asada burrito was good  I can t expect them to have SD tortillas here. Roll tacos were kinda small. Still worth it  I think. No place really to sit when I visited. I really have to come back and try again now that they ve been open for a while. I hope this takes off and they get a brick and mortar together.
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,19,This is the second time I have had Daygo s and I can say with full confidence that the California butrito is the best burrito I have EVER had. Daygo s catered our office lunch last month and it has been the talk of the office ever since. I went back for seconds tonight and it confirmed my opinion of being the best. Andre  you are a perfectionist and terrific entrepreneur. You will be the talk of this foodie town one day 
Daygo's San Diego Taco Shop,20,Delicious rolled tacos  amazing service by Dre 
Tacos El Charly,1,I come here at least once a week  This place is one of my favorite food trucks in Austin and has the best tacos in the city. My favorite items from here are their Al Pastor tacos on mini corn tortillas and the Beef Quesadilla. I also love their Horchata and Jamaica. Their food always hits the spot and what makes it even better is that the food is always ready in under five minutes. They re quick  efficient  and have amazing food.   One thing to know is that they take CASH ONLY so before you go make sure you bring some with you.   One of the best spots in Austin and would definitely recommend it 
Tacos El Charly,2,I will say that I will be biased because I come from the valley  where the best food is served and affordable  a taco can cost 0.50   . Still trying to get used to being overcharged at Austin.   Anyways  I wasn t impressed with this place. I ordered 6 mini tacos priced at  1.70 each w o tax. Most taco stands I ve been make tortillas de ma z with aceite  and if you want it seco  you would ask for it. I was surprised that by default the tortillas were dry. It made the tasting experience bland. Also they didn t have salsa verde only like a red looking sauce that tasted like bbq    .   I also ordered a torta priced at  8 w o tax. Much to my demise  the torta was small af. It was a tad bit smaller than my hand. For the price  I expected more. The torta only had the meat  avocado and tomato. I was disappointed that it didn t come with jam n or lettuce unless I have to request it.   Finally  I thought they had coca mexicanas de Joya. Usually that s the standard at a Mexican stand. So when I got a manzana soda  it tasted like apple juice lol. My sister got an horchata and it was pretty sweet. Also  no charros were served with the tacos. It is cash only. A good thing to appreciate is that they are open late until 3 am which is great for the late night munchies.   I will still be out for my hunt for the tastiest stand at a reasonable price. You might find it to your liking and why not give it a shot  but as someone from the 956 with true tasting buds  this was not it for me.
Tacos El Charly,3,Si pudiera no le dar a ni una sola estrella.   La peor experiencia  que he tenido en Austin  hoy 22 de julio 2022   9 pm  Un borracho todo miado  cargado y vomitado por las mesas.   Agarrando las salsas y lo que se le echa a los tacos   todo un asco .  Y no hicieron  casi nada por retirarlo del lugar.    Debut y despedida de ir a ese  lugar .  Y por supuesto no lo recomendar a  con mis amigos
Tacos El Charly,4,The BEST tacos in Austin  and I don t say that lightly. Get the tacos al pastor or the gringas. The meat in the tacos is so juicy  and I love the cheesiness of the gringas. Every person that I ve ever brought with me to Tacos El Charly is beyond impressed.   I like to load my tacos up with the green salsa  chopped onions  and cucumber slices. The service is also super quick  and I like how convenient the station is set up for people to grab their own sides and sauces as they wait for their order to be ready. Go here and you won t be disappointed     FYI  they only take cash so be prepared  
Tacos El Charly,5,I can t find any other taco places like this. Good taco with good price. Definitely go again  highly recommended.
Tacos El Charly,6,Make sure you bring cash  We got bistec  pastor  tripa  buche  suadero. My ranking from best is  pastor  suadero  buche  stomach   tripa  bistec. The pastor was so juicy and flavorful--would double down on this.
Tacos El Charly,7,Very good Tacos place   Out of 10 I give it 9.... Sauce was hot and the meat had a good flavor. Only reason I don t give it a 10 was the pineapple water wasn t to great. .. but other than that great tacos.
Tacos El Charly,8,Such good late nights tacos     Have their own little salsa bar which was great and the tacos were really good. Only thing is it stinks so bad in this area and their was fun shots while I was there lmao. Other than that the place is good
Tacos El Charly,9,This place actually has the best tacos in Austin. They open starting at 8  but it s the perfect late dinner midnight munchie. If you come in a large group  more than 5 people   it may be a little hard to find seats. I usually get a variety of the meats since you really can t go wrong here. All the meats are packed with flavor   they give onions  lime  jalapenos  and sauces for free to add more flavor. My personal favorites are the tripa and pastor. The horchata is also quite refreshing and comes in a very large cup. Last thing I ll say is that they will literally get your order out before you can even find a table. They prepare the food as if they already knew wheat you were ordering before you ordered. If there was an Olympic sport for preparing tacos  Tacos El Charly gets the gold and leaves the competition in the dust.  Also they only take cash  so make sure to bring cash
Tacos El Charly,10,Best taco  It s a food truck and truly authentic  They only accept cash  but the corn taco and the meat are AMAZING    My number 1 ever since. There s a long line waiting and you can tell immediately how delicious the tacos are once you get near.
Tacos El Charly,11,We were in the mood of some street tacos and we found this place not that far from where we at in Austin at that time 7 pm   The line was long but wait.. why so we got in line and it went fast.  Got two tacos al pastor and one with tripas and my wife got one pastor and one barbacoa.   The night was nice and the music was playing and the food was good really good.
Tacos El Charly,12,Recently I came to Tacos El Charly and even though I m half Mexican  I still stuck out like a sore thumb  but that s when I knew I was getting myself into some good food   What I got here was their Pastor  spit-grilled pork   Suadero  think  Hanger steak almost  but more smooth   and Bistek  beef sirloin usually .  I was highly satisfied to see that these were  2.40 each and were FILLED with meat. Can t find tacos like these very often in town  However  I felt the meats left more to be desired in that they all tasted the same. It s almost as if they just cook all the meats on the same grill. I couldn t really tell which was the al pastor  pork  and which was bistek  beef    I tell you this  if you are simply looking for big portioned tacos at a great price and aren t too worried about the potential for flavor overlap  then come check them out  It was BUSY when I came  so that could be it  although I still believe they should portion out sections of the grill to cook certain meats. With that said  I give them arouund a 4 5 for having a mix of good and great qualities.
Tacos El Charly,13,Certainly the best deal for tacos in town we re found so far. Very busy but extremely efficient in taking and filling orders. Some of the best horchata in town too. Just didn t really find any of the meats that distinct or impressive. Nothing like eg Taqueria El picante or Cuantoss tacos.
Tacos El Charly,14,Mediocre Mexican food. I ordered a torta with asada and tripas doradas.  9 seemed reasonable until I saw the size of the torta which was way too small  and to top it off they forgot my tripas. The asada was cooked well but had little flavor. The salsa rojas have way too much cumin and are not flavorful or spicy. One of the salsas taste more like BBQ sauce instead of salsa roja. Definitely not worth it.
Tacos El Charly,15,Best damn tacos you can find on Lamar and really fast reliable service 10 10 never miss
Tacos El Charly,16,Really yummy and cheap tiny tacos  I got two pastor mini tacos and they re only  1.40 each. I think that getting sauces toppings from the table is a must. I added in the onions   cilantro and the red salsa and I think it really elevated the meal. Only downside is that after driving back home  the tacos were a little cold and didn t taste amazing. Will definitely come back to eat them while they re hot  super value and authentic 
Tacos El Charly,17,Imagine waking up on Christmas morning as a kid  flipping to the cool side of your pillow  or jumping into a hot shower on a cold winter day. Grabbing tacos here is like a cocktail mixture of the best feelings in the world  except you can experience that sacred  first time  every time you eat here.  The food truck opens well past normal dinner time  late at 8pm CST  yet the line forms faster than the Black Friday rush into Walmart and clears out at the speed of light. I don t know how these guys do it  but unlike these other taco food trucks in Austin  you will get your tacos really quickly. By the way  make sure you bring cash   A perfect spot to stop by for dinner or late night munchies  my personal go-to is always the tripa and pastor. They also give you toppings  onions  lime  jalapenos  to finish up your perfect tacos. If you re a sucker for that refreshing drink on a hot summer day  I would also recommend getting the horchata. I m not lying when I say it s a big cup.  I ll finish with this. If you haven t been here for tacos  you re living in the stone ages. Tacos El Charly will bring fire  science  and technology into your historical world and life will never be the same again after.
Tacos El Charly,18,Decided to try this place one night at 11pm cause we had heard really good things about it and it definitely became one of my top taco places in Austin  Even at 11pm  business was still pretty busy  which says a lot about their food quality. We ordered 6 mini tacos and it came out to only  9   1.40 per mini taco . It was so good...Great food for an even greater price. The Pastor taco was probably my favorite and my friend got a horchata and said it was pretty good as well.
Tacos El Charly,19,Honestly  Tacos el Charly has the best tacos I ve ever had in my entire life. I can t believe I discovered this place in my last year in Austin because I know I will be craving. Bring cash  and expect to wait in a long line  However  the line moves relatively fast and it s well worth the time you spend. Their al pastor is the best  in my opinion  and their sauces are delicious. I especially love their horchata.
Tacos El Charly,20,Best truly authentic Mexican tacos in Austin. We come here at least one a week and that s because we live 35 minutes away. But so worth the drive.
Tacos El Charly,21,If you looking for late night tacos that are okay ish then come here. There super friendly and fast but the tacos are not that great. They meat is dry  and not flavorful  one of the worst tacos I have had in a long time.
Tacos El Charly,22,FWIW  I lived in Monterrey  Mexico  for about 20 years  and these are my favorite tacos in Austin.
Tacos El Charly,23,Tacos El Charly are the best tacos in Austin. How do I know  Because a customer who was born in Mexico sat at our table and drove 45 minutes from Driftwood for the best interior and authentic Mexican tacos in Austin.  It was better than the tacos I ve had in Tijuana and Rosarito. All of the customers were Mexican except us. It s so authentic that they only speak Spanish. You have to place your order in Spanish  so luckily my husband took Spanish during high school. They only accept cash. I ordered tacos al pastor and an agua fresca. The line was long but it went quickly as they have an assembly of seven to eight workers inside the food truck. You can see them slicing the trompo. Trompo is a Lebanese influence on Mexican cuisine. The food came out fast as well. They are open until 3 am. It s located in what appeared to be Little Mexico. I can t eat at any other taco truck after having been to Tacos El Charly.
Tacos El Charly,24,There was no flavor in any of the tacos I got and the Chile has no flavor either . I don t recommend this place everything was bland.
Tacos El Charly,25,I had this last night and can t stop thinking about it. I regret not going back and getting another round of mini tacos. I mean  for  1.20 taco you simply can t go wrong. Affordability aside  these tacos are the best I ve had in Austin. There are no hipsters in sight  the area is a little bit sketchy  and I was harassed for money by a passer by. But who cares  this is truly a hole in the wall gem.   As far as I can tell  they re not open during the day. Seems like 8pm-3am Fri-Sun and 8pm-1 30am all other days. It s truly one of the greatest spots in the city to satisfy those late night cravings. It s not gentrified like all the other taco joints around here...so brush up on your Spanish before you go.   You won t find chicken here...beef is king. They ve got fantastic Al Pastor  however it didn t have any pineapple...which I didn t mind. Also  they ve got incredible grilled jalape os and onions that they included with the tacos which I loved  but decimated my wife s tongue. So people that are sensitive to that  consider yourself warned.   Godspeed.
Tacos El Charly,26,Incredible spot that is so easy to pass by without noticing. Easily the best tacos I ve had in Austin  and the service is really fast too. Great selection of salsa  and the horchata is really refreshing and has the perfect amount of sweetness. All of this for an extremely affordable price makes this place a new go to for me.
Tacos El Charly,27,Tacos were delicious as was their green salsa. Tortillas were quality  amp  price was definitely right. I liked it so much I went back another night the same week.  amp  I would have definitely frequented this place quite a bit. So you ask what went wrong  They had some short  little white man standing by the opening to the truck s kitchen while I was placing my order who screamed at me the entire time  White girl go home.   We don t want you here.  I thought the dude was homeless or on drugs because I didn t have a single interaction with him nor anyone else there before he started screaming at me. But no  the people working in the kitchen knew the man  I watched them chat with him as I got in my car-as he was still screaming at me to leave  and did absolutely nothing as he was shouting at a paying customer. I don t feel like I even need to defend myself here but I m sweet as can be to every cashier because I myself a work in a restaurant  I tipped well  and I order bistec tacos with no modifications. I m the type of customer that comes back and treats everyone with kindness and respect. I should have asked for my money back. I should have left. But I just stood there and ignored the crazy  disrespectful man while they prepared my order. I weighed even writing this review  but the way I was spoken to was disgusting and I hope no one else has to experience that. So yeah if you re going here as a single woman I would highly advise to not go at night.  amp  to the business owner  the little man that loiters at night is going to hurt your ability to grow your business-your food is absolutely delicious  amp  I wish I would be going back. But sadly  I don t like paying to be harassed.
Tacos El Charly,28,The only taco place I go to in Austin. Most authentic Mexican food I can get on this side of the border. I crave this place all the time. It s simple  but that s what makes it so much better. AND the prices are great for what it is - save yourself some heartache at Tex-Mex around town and just go here  whether for dinner or a late-night snack or a random taco run.
Tacos El Charly,29,Best Pastor out there right now  I got there at 8pm  Saturday Night and the line was already 15-20 people deep  but I was ordering in 10 mins  amp  got my food 10 mins after that. Ordered 3 Pastor s  amp  2 Bistec s. The Pastor meet is moist but not too moist. They serve their tacos meat  amp  tortilla and they have a large stand outside the truck with Cilantro Onion  radishes cucumber anabout 4 to 5 different hot sauces that you gather yourself while waiting for your food. The Bistec was good but the Pastor is epic. This place is a well oiled machine as they have 2 guys taking orders  amp  4-5 guys in the truck in a service line preparing everything. One guy is out wiping down tables  sweeping  switching out the hot sauces cilantro onions etc when getting anywhere close to low  I was beyond impressed.
Tacos El Charly,30,Perfection in simplicity. Tacos El Charly on N. Lamar is my new obsession. These are no frills tacos  and sometimes that is exactly what I want. Be prepared for a line when you get here. This joint opens nightly at 8pm  I got there at 8 02 and was among many others waiting to eat  Thanks to  kovertagent for this find. The most authentic taco I ve had so far in Austin. Better brush up on your high school Spanish  order numbers are called out in Espanol only. They have a variety of meats from Al pastor pork   bistek beef   chorizo  to the more interesting  tripe and buche  pork stomach . If you are lucky you may be able to buy a fresh coconut to drink from  there is sometimes a pick up truck there selling them right from the back of the vehicle. .
Tacos El Charly,31,Went specifically because I always see a long line and wanted to see what the fuss was about.  Truly the best tacos I ve had in Austin. I brought my dad along since he s always looking for a good place to get tripa tacos from and he is now hooked on this place. There s also a guy that is out there selling flans  jello  and arroz con leche.  Also  another guy selling churros.
Tacos El Charly,32,The most legit street tacos that will take you back to the D.F. and make your hair smell like tacos for a week because you sat outside the truck with your friends for hours ordering seconds and thirds. The menu is pretty simple  trompo al pastor  bistek  cabeza  chorizo  suadero  tripa  and buche in mini taco  regular taco  quesadilla  torta  or burrito form. The jamaica is great as it s not too sweet. I like to get the mini tacos. The tortillas are not handmade  but you will forget that once you see how they are treated with the perfect serving of fried meats  grilled onions  and a chile toreado if you re lucky. Be prepared to wait in line  relearn your spanish  the order numbers are called out in spanish over a not very clear intercom   and pay cash. Sometimes there is a guy selling watermelons and pineapples out of his truck there. Sometimes another guy is selling homemade flan. Bring cash for them too.
Tacos El Charly,33,We live in the area and this is where we go to get street tacos.  I am from El Paso and my wife is from Cd Juarez.  This is as close to Mexico style tacos we have found in Austin.    I like the tripas and pastor  I tried the cabeza and buche which were both good I just like the other one better.  There always seems to be a line  deal with it.
Tacos El Charly,34,We were curious what the big deal was with this food truck since there s always a long line. We waited for about 40 minutes but those tacos were not worth the wait. Price is reasonable but did not find any flavor to those tacos.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,1,The food and service is excellent I love their menudo it s a great meal after a Friday night the location is in a great spot east Austin   .......  ...  ..-...................   ..            ................  The food is great
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,2,This place over charged me then said  the menue prices are not right. They charged  7.99 for 1 bean and cheese tostada then said there is nothing they can do about it. The food is not that good.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,3,This is a wonderful  non-flashy Mexican restaurant we discovered after visiting a local wine bar. Decided to check it out. Walked in and there were no silly outfits or a hostess with a flower in her hair  like at major chain restaurants . Instead we had a very nice woman who took is to a booth. This is a genuine  plain  take a seat restaurant.  We received chips and salsa and learned the green salsa is hotter than red--so we stuck with it. It had a solid degree for fire to please your tongue. We ordered the 5 mini tacos. They had great corn tortillas  the grilled bulbed onion was very tasty. Both al pastor and beef were seasoned well. Definitely recommend this meal. We also had the grilled chicken quesadilla. The tortilla was wonderful  but the cheese wasn t fully melted. The chicken was cooked well  but was plain tasting. The lettuce and pico on the side  however  was very fresh. But overall it was rather disappointing.  Our entire experience was very good  so we plan on returning and trying other dishes.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,4,It was pouring on our drive to Austin  so we decided this was the perfect excuse to pull off to the side and visit this Mexican restaurant  The place was a little small and crammed  but the teal table booths and dainty outdoor lights gave it unique personality. We were seated right away and served complementary chips and salsa  which were a bit stale but still appreciated. We ordered the chicken enchiladas and breaded shrimp meals  which were both pretty good  Everything was made hot to order and came out pretty quickly. We enjoyed the food while rain drizzled in the background. Despite the unpredictable weather  it made for a fun new dining experience 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,5,This only the 2nd time I ve been motivated to write a review. I ve been to Beto s a handful of times  and generally speaking   it varies from three to four stars. Never terrible  never exceptional  which is kind of best case scenario for a Tex-Mex dive. IYKYK  Tuesdays are tough in a 1 mile radius of my 7th and Springdale location because practically everything is closed. That  coupled with the fact that I had a craving for chicken tortilla soup on this cold night  I decided to give Beto s soup a chance  despite how uninspired I might have been about it. And because I did  I am now spending my moments of post-dinner contentment  writing this. If you re in the neighborhood and jonsing for some soup  gather  7.99  plus gratuity  and get to Beto s   You get a massive 24 oz serving of hot  fresh and clean broth  loaded with pulled chicken breast  zucchini  carrots  red potatoes  onions  and Mexican rice. Served separately are the traditional garnishes - healthy servings of pico  tortilla strips  white cheese  two fat lime wedges and three bright slices of avocado. The entire time my partner and I were slurping our bowls of soup  we couldn t keep from praising it  which ultimately led to the grand decision to give a positive review. Beto s deserves it  And y all deserve to know.   Couldn t drop a 5th star because I ve had other things on the menu that really don t warrant that kind of praise  but I would for just the soup  Also - wish they didn t serve their to-go items in tons of styrofoam  but maybe you can bring in your own thermos and Tupperware    So  if it s Tuesday  or any day  and cold  or if you like soup when it s warm too  and you re craving some chicken tortilla soup  Beto s will certainly satisfy 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,6,I feel like even the English-speaking staff  doesn t really want to speak English to guests. And that s OK because at least they will labor with you to get the food you want. Staff spent a few minutes arguing about what kind of meat is best in a taco  I was ordering tacos   and I m very satisfied. Can t say I know what I m eating exactly but I can say I know I m eating good. I just like those good ole fashions... those white corn tortilla   cilantro   onion   meat combos. This hit the spot 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,7,Recently moved here from New Mexico  and really missing authentic Mexican food  loved loved loved  this is the real deal  So happy we tried it 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,8,Happy we came here while getting a tire patched next door at Leal s.   It feels like old Austin and the food selection is great. Want delicious  satisfying Mexican food  Come here  you ll be so happy you did.  Leaving the airport  amp  starving for some great  quick  convenient Tex-mex  Come here    The service is quick and friendly. A serious locals spot.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,9,This place is on point  service was great and the food was awesome  The gordita plate was great  lotta food. I would definitely comeback.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,10,I called because there is not a menu online and I was treating friends that fixed my car today and they were excited to have some Beto s yummy food.  Since it was for pick-up I called to find out where the actual menu could be found online. She smart-assed me and then hung up on me without any explanation.  I would have thought your places would WANT business. Obviously NOT.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,11,Really good food  great price  Homemade tortillas and a home-like feel within the restaurant. Fast service 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,12,Stopped here when taking my dog to emancipet. No-frills kind of place but very authentic food and amazing service. Enchiladas were killer. I love a mom and pop establishment 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,13,The black bean soup is so delicious but please don t make me suffer through the long winded recording when I call to speak to somebody to place a to-go order.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,14,Goto for breakfast tacos when you don t want a line. 5 min prep time makes for an easy grab and go. Green salsa is the truth. Red salsa has enough heat to make chips interesting. Mini tacos suadero is something special. Five dollar burritos are hard to pass up.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,15,Seriously y all  this is the real deal.   And y all know how the Sharbs is picky.  A friend took me here after a day of errand running and our last stop was the HEB on E. 7th.  When she said    Let me get you some lunch. Just down the street  I know the best little Mexi...   I already had the car in drive and was making a right out of the parking lot.  Tucked in a tiny little space Beto s is unassuming and you could almost miss it if you weren t paying attention.  Like  you could drive past it everyday and not notice it  but you really should.  The first time we went was about 2 on a Sunday  It was packed.  We were lucky to get a 2 man table stuffed against a wall.  TOTES WORTH IT    I ordered my  1st time at a Mexican joint  standard  a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco.  The chicken in the taco was crazy flavorful and moist and the taco shell was clearly fresh made with a corn tortilla.  Not quite a  puffy taco   but dang  it was tryin and almost succeedin .  The cheese enchilada was stuffed with white cheese and so delicious   I m hooked y all   My 2nd trip trip a friend and i HAD to try the Beto s platter  which comes with beef and chicken fajita  shrimp and sausage.  Plus peppers  onions  pico  avocado  all the good stuff.  We ate like kings   Everything was cooked perfectly and we were stuffed   We were there later in the evening this time and it was less packed.  Service was attentive  the tables were clean and the price was definitely right.  I will be back over and over.  As a matter of fact i ve got a hankering for some tacos right about now 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,16,Unless I m out of town  I usually like to wait to post a review of a place after I ve been a few times.  I ll make a concession for Beto s.  We were trying to have Mexican food for lunch and the first two places we went were packed and closed  so we turned to Yelp for help.  That s when we noted Beto s.  We hadn t heard of it before and realized we rarely go east of Pleasant Valley.  Beto s building is pretty ragged.  Don t be scared. The lunch special value was excellent.  The food was very good.  The day we went the special was the Mexican plate.  A taco  two enchiladas  beans  and rice.  The taco was terrific.  The enchiladas weren t the greatest  but they were capable.  Beans and rice were also capable.   They don t have many tables  so everyone shouldn t go at once.  It also stood up to the gringo test  as Bill J and I were the only gringos there.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,17,Just because a Mexican restaurant is a Ma and Pa place  and just because it is crammed with locals  does not always mean it is wonderful.  Of course  the locals may know what to order ......  Beto s is on 7th street  east of the yuppies - although the yuppies are closing in on three sides.  The clientele is old school neighborhood Mexican.  This should in theory mean wonderful food.  Beto s can be nearly deserted at dinner time  but it has a huge breakfast trade.  That is already one tip.  At Breakfast  nearly everyone was ordering either menudo or huevos rancheros.  My dining mate had huevos with nopales.  They were pretty good    or at least as good as scrambled eggs with green things in them can be .  I have had at various times the chalupas and the queso compuesto  The chalupas were meh.  The queso came with chips that seemed homemade but stale.  The queso itself was filled with stuff but didn t taste like much. It was under-salted  although salting didn t make it that much better.  Taste-wise  it could be that menudo and huevos rancheros are the way to go at this place.  However  on the plus side  they are generous with quantity.  I waddled out of there both times stuffed to the gills.   I didn t pay very much money either time. That counts for something.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,18,Some of the best Mexican food I ve had in Austin. Prices are reasonable  there s plenty of parking  and service is fast. Highly recommend. The salsa was fresh and the chicken enchilada plate I had was well seasoned and flavorful. Really excited to have discovered this gem and I will be returning  I m already craving their refried beans.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,19,Two truths  Beto s was not our originally planned lunch location and I don t normally get too worked up over Mexican food.   No lies  the food at Beto s was a step above your average Mexican food fare  3 stars in my book  - I had a chicken poblano empanada and an al pastor taco both of which I highly recommend. The drinks  on the other hand  fell short. I had two margaritas but they were premixed and  nothing to shake a stick at  as my mother would say. If you re wondering why I got a second  see my review for The Wax Bar -- that s where I was headed after lunch. The beer selection was decent though with a variety of options available from Argentinian lagers to Real Ale options as well.   Our server was great  I forgot her name  but 5 stars for her   and we got a table quickly and didn t wait long for anything. Side note  I did hear a woman at a table nearby say that Beto s is always on her list of places she recommends in SA to visitors and she included it on the list along with Guillermo s which made me respect her choice  go there too if you haven t  . Overall  I d go back and maybe try another dish next time but I ll steer clear of the margs.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,20,Cheap. Delicious. Traditional. Rad service. Daily lunch special are priced under 10 and the tacos are legit as fuck. Pastor tacos and milenesa tortas all day here.  No liquor  but they do have beer. If you re having drinks next door at Lucky Lounge  you can order food and have it sent over. I really don t want to give out my sweet spot but everyone should try this place.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,21,Nice little restaurant  food was hot and fresh. Service was really good made you feel right at home. Only fall back it s small and it gets pack which means something  it s good.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,22,This place opened in the old jalape os   At first I was a little upset because I always came here for shrimp tacos and didn t see any on their menu.  The server told us that they bought the old restaurant out and that it is a new owner.  They have a very extensive menu and I noticed on the way in they have a daily lunch special and they are open for breakfast  lunch and dinner.  You get your standard chips and salsa while you are deciding on your order.  The chips were fresh and the salsa very spicy so be careful if you don t like heat   Erica V. and I both ordered the chicken monterey and it also happened to be their lunch special.  It was the same portion size as the menu item but  was about  4.00 cheaper which was a win   You also get the standard question of flour or corn tortillas.  The food came out very quickly and was piping hot   The chicken monterey came topped with mushrooms  green peppers  onions and mozzarella cheese with pico de gallo  guacamole  lettuce  beans and rice.  Chicken Monterey   The chicken was juicy  flavorful  well seasoned and the toppings were not only fresh but  not overcooked and no burnt cheese   Yeah   Rice   Light  fluffy  not dry and well seasoned   Guacamole   Definitely made in house daily   Refried Beans   As much as I hate to admit that I am not a fan of refried beans  I would order these again   They still have packaged desserts by the register and the inside of the restaurant has not changed at all.  Overall this was a 5 star experience and I liked the food better than the last restaurant that inhabited this space on the East side 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,23,Good food  friendly service And the 3 tacos deal before 11am basically can t be best another
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,24,We found this little gem just around the corner from our gym. We popped in after rock-climbing and were really impressed with the tastiness and attention to detail. The salsa was had some serious spice to it  tip of the hat for not shying away from the peppers  and their salsa verde was ever spicier. My wife and I both opted for the green chili chicken enchiladas and were very impressed. They used a mix of white and dark meat chicken which is the only way to go. Bonus star for the beans and rice being tasty. Great value  good location  well-executed Mexican food  Oh yeah  this is in the rotation now.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,25,Beto s is my new favorite sit-down norte o Mex spot. Once you get past the usually slightly stale chips  this place doesn t miss the mark on the classics. I have been for dinner three times and breakfast once  I also ordered take-out breakfast tacos.   On my first visit I went with a recommendation from the  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Ffedmanwalking.com amp s 3a367870c7119871d46f2ee0a0c8e3e7fd406874869d2ce7294314c910059f55  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  fedmanwalking.com  a  500 tacos challenge and ordered the suadero  tender beef belly   tripas  order them crispy    and al pastor on their house made corn tortillas. It s hard not to like a place that hands you its creamy salsa verde in a maple syrup dispenser. You ll want to keep that hot green goodness flowing because the tacos are generously sized  three might be too many unless you are starving or order nothing else.  Hint  Order a chile toreado for 25 cents--whole jalape o dropped in the deep fryer.   Their breakfast menu is the bible of cheap tasty eats.  3.50 will get you three tacos  they all have to be the same kind . Before 11 AM  they are 1.99 each. Migas  huevos a la mexicana  bean and cheese  and papas rancheras have everything that you expect out of a solid breakfast taco. The migas rancheras plate just about left me comatose  So. much. food. Lardy  silky beans  cooked-through potatoes  toasty corn tortillas  bright yellow cheese  fluffy eggs  bacon strip atop  It s like falling into a warm bed freshly made up by your mamma and going to sleep for a few ages.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,26,Quick good Mexican breakfast and menudo. Just wish the tortillas were homemade. Excellent service.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,27,Tacos ARE YUM    Service was good. My kid love cheese omelet but it wasn t on the menu as part of the childs plate  the cook made him one any way  most places won t   so when my 2 year old is happy and eats his food  well that means mama can eat in peace   Thanks Beto s  
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,28,Everyone s experience is different but for me it s always amazing. This is my go to Mini - tacos barbacoa al pastor tacos it s so good plus their green sauce is super spicy I love it.    I don t really order anything other than those delightful tacos.. and Orchata drink omg.  delicious 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,29,We got fantastic burritos to go the first time we went a week ago. So good  in fact  that we craved them  amp  had to go back tonight after a long day of running errands  etc. THE WORST BURRITOS EVER. I may be hangry  but chicken  amp  lettuce loosely wrapped in a tortilla does not a burrito make-come on        Not risking another trip back  at least when you go to Taco Bell you know exactly what you re going get. Oh-and don t get excited over the photo  we paid for extra chicken  hangry  .
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,30,Very solid Mexican restaurant. No frills on the decor - diner seating and the two person tables are tiny. Service is friendly  though they initially missed an order.   Seems a bit more like a place geared towards true Mex than tex Mex. Cheese on the breakfast tacos is fake and the potatoes are a pretty featureless mash.   But their barbacoa is outstanding  tender but not overly greasy  and a generous portion. Their tortillas are hand made as advertised  and delicious. And the chorizo and egg taco is similarly full of flavor but low on the grease quotient. The mini tacos are the real deal. We will come back to try the dinner menu 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,31,I love Beto s  the food is consistently good but the service and warm atmosphere takes this place over the top 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,32,I definitely cannot complain about the food. I will give credit where it is due and the food is great. However  here is where they went wrong   I was basically a regular here  we would go in up to 3 times a week. One evening  it was about 8p.m and we walked in and sat at a table. The restaurant was full of people with menus and there were waitresses on duty. After we got settled and waited maybe five minutes  a waitress came over and told us they were no longer waiting and only offered take out. I m sorry  but where did they give notice of this  And what about everyone else that was eating and had menus ready to order  Why was she there ready to serve when she had no intentions of doing so  Needless to say we walked out and never came back. I respect rules  and I understand certain things make sense business wise. But don t be unprofessional and come up with rules you don t follow and give no prior warning for. This place was a joke to me from then on and I refuse to give my business to a place that refuses my business.   Wishing you the best  Beto s.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,33,The food is good an all but man it makes you piss outta your ass but not just once the whole week
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,34,Ceviche was super good and the service was even better.  Really great salsa too   We also had a very fresh avocado torta and shrimp cocktail.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,35,Betos is great  authentic  unpretentious Mexican food with good service. They are there when you can t bring yourself to cook. My favorites are their barbacoa taco  c ctel de camar n  and side of nopal. Their menudo is delicious and will cure what ails you. I love Beto s and you should too.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,36,Beto s is the jam  Great Mexican food. They have awesome lunch special like fish and shrimp Veracruz. I typically order the flautas because they are cheap and it s a lot of food. The entrees can get expensive  12- 15  but everything is good. There are only about 12 tables. 2 tv s. Nice staff.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,37,Excellent food and great service   This is a mostly Spanish speaking place  but the food is so good  I hope you won t let that stop you from visiting  I had the Chicken Monterey and the meat was so moist it was hard to believe  Hubby had the beef stew and the flavor and tenderness of the meat were amazing. Everyone else at the table was more than pleased with their choices and the boys were very happy for all of the leftovers We will definitely visit again when we are in Austin.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,38,The salsa is amazing   Friendly service and the food came out quickly too. Definitely recommend 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,39,This place is walkable from my house so I had to try it. Cheap and super tasty. The salsa is delicious and their chips are the right thickness  and my chicken enchiladas are some of the better ones I ve had in austin. They lose one star for not having margaritas but we all have our flaws  and I made due with a modelo today
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,40,Yuck. Stale chips to go with the salsa to start. Ordered chicken fajitas--the picture of which looked good enough sizzling on a comal on the menu--only for them to arrive tepid on a room temperature plate. Beans tasted old and cold. Rice the same. They offered up maybe a teaspoon of guac on a pathetic bed of wilted lettuce. The only thing they didn t screw up was the Negra Modelo--it thankfully didn t arrive at room temp.  Jesus this was bad. Over 18 bucks for this lousy meal including tip  I always tip well  it s not the waitstaffs fault the place sucks .  Oh  the patron at the table next to me ordered beef fajitas and barely touched them  so I m not alone.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,41,Good service. Queso was good as was the salsa. Our chips were stale but replaced when asked. We had the enchiladas with the regular gravy sauce. The gravy taste like it was from a can. With all the great Tex mex in Austin we probably won t be back here.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,42,Good  solid place  definitely recommended. Tasty food  fast service  relatively inexpensive  all-around a good experience.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,43,I m no connoisseur of Mexican cuisine but Ive been here twice  amp  my lunch was splendid both times.  Beef fajitas were excellent as were the homemade tacos.  On my second trip the steak ranchero was exceptional.  The salsa is great too  it s actually a little spicy  amp  has a nice flavor.  Patronize this place if you have a chance.  The food is great  service is really quick and the prices are reasonable.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,44,Woah   This place was fantastic.  We had the  chicken fajita torta  shrimp empanidato  and a veggie chalupa... Blissful   Everything was cooked perfectly... Very filling.  It was so good I wanted to order more food before we left and take it home with me   Thank you for such a great dinner
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,45,Definitely the food is great but the service is horrible We come to this place because is close to our office but I don t think We want to come back again the oldest lady is always mad like if We not going to pay the customer service is very horrible...
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,46,good breakfast taco  amp  lunch specials.  real deal TexMex. this is where the smart folks go 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,47,Best ranchero sauce in town. Super quick food and great service. Great prices  too  brkfst is  1 off before 11. 
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,48,Love this tiny place  It s a sleeper for sure  way out east 7th Street -- but well worth the short drive. The owners are serious about the food and the staff is as nice as can be. I have been for lunch on several occasions and tried a lot of dishes  but keep coming back to the hearty bowl of tortilla soup. The  small  would be a large at many places in town and the flavors are delicious. It s a meal  or maybe add a single taco if you are hungry. The tacos al pastor  see photo  show a true understanding of this marvelous street-cart dish  the enchiladas verdes demonstrate a deft touch with tomatillo sauce. The complimentary salsa is excellent. My ice tea glass was refilled promptly and the lady at the counter  yes  this is the kind of place where you pay at the register  offered me a tea to go. Not surprisingly  many of the other diners are blue collar workers from the area  mostly Mexican-Americans. I am glad to be let in on their secret.
Beto's Mexican Restaurant,49,really good texmex food and really charming  caring folks. a nice place to eat and have a quiet conversation. all of the food is fresh and good. the fresh handmade tortillas are excellent. in my own texmex top 5 in austin.
Mission Street Burrito,1,MSB is phenomenal   Vegan crunch wrap that tastes better than the OG. 4 real. I also feel like it s 2x as large.  I also ordered the Mac n Cheese burrito with chicken. It came with a green sauce  which I m usually not a fan of  however... this was next level yumminess  It s also MASSIVE  It was 2.5 meals for me  Seriously  May have to get one after I write this review.   Nachos are always a fave  too. Layered and literally every chip is covered. No one likes dry nachos    I like mine with carne asada. Loaded with beans and meat and jalape os and queso and guaco  it s what dreams are made of.  Also note  there s a pay it forward meal  where you can donate to someone in need for a free meal or if you re light on cash or in need  it s free. That s the MISSION. Straight out of San Fran.  10 10. Mission street is passionate  amp  they are serving up vegan Mexican comfort food with incredible flavor and a whole lotta love 
Mission Street Burrito,2, 14.99 for pico  guacamole and chips. The pico - I swear to god - is the crap that comes in the giant tubs at bulk food stores like Costco. The  guacamole  is the vacuum bagged Wholly avocado crap. Literally nothing else was in it.   The burrito was absolutely inedible and stank of Daiya cheese. Ordered through UberEats and threw away  35 in the trash can.
Mission Street Burrito,3,This place is kinda fun.  Seeing as how it s basically just a small counter within a bodega  The Austinite Market  with nothing more than a touch-screen tablet kiosk for placing orders  it s not exactly what I was expecting. I was hoping to speak to someone about some of the details of the dishes but the counter was unmanned and there was literally nobody around to address questions about the menu.  I ordered THE CRUNCHWRAP  Impossible Carne Asada  Credo oat milk queso  crispy tostada shell  pico de gallo  shredded lettuce  guacamole and sour cream.  I was very excited about the format. It s creative  I give them that. The outer flour tortilla was browned and had a nice little crunch to it as did the inner tostada shell. The Impossible Carne Asada was nice but was lacking some of the marinated and seared flavors that I was anticipating. The guacamole and pico helped to blend everything nicely though. It seems a bit over-priced  I paid twenty bucks for just this one item. I support this place because everything on the menu is vegetarian and because they use Impossible Foods products instead of Beyond Meat.  I prefer Impossible.  However  if you re looking for some interesting and satisfying mexican flavors  there are plenty of other spots in town that will certainly more fully satisfy your cravings.
Mission Street Burrito,4,Phenomenal once again  I wish i had pics but i crushed it too fast...  If tour hungry... eat here... if you love food... eat here...  if you love plants... eat here...  If you love pacha mama... eat here... if you love animals more than you love eating them... eat here... If you are a proud carnivore...eat here... if you want a tastey journey that ends with your mind being blown while you ask yourself the age old question  where s the beef  ... EAT HERE
Mission Street Burrito,5,All I got to say is...if you re craving a vegan breakfast burrito  and I mean a REAL vegan breakfast burrito  you ve come to the right place. Quite literally the best breakfast burrito my tastebuds have ever experienced. Not to mention they have been sampling some amazing pasta dishes and an incredible soft serve to beat the heat. I could literally order this breakfast burrito again  and again again . Thank you Mission Street Burrito 
Mission Street Burrito,6,As a longtime vegetarian who adores Mexican food  this restaurant is the holy grain when it comes to healthy Mexican options. I can now satisfy my Crunchwrap cravings without feeling guilty afterwards. Oh  and don t forget to finish your meal with one of the CREAMIEST and TASTIEST cones in Austin.  DON T SLEEP ON MSB.
Mission Street Burrito,7,They do the Beyond steak just right in the breakfast burrito. Nice tangy pop and good texture.
Mission Street Burrito,8,Ahhhh wow the CRONCHWRAP y all  So many flavors all at once. Glad to have come at a time with mint chocolate swirl ice cream. And the service folks were LOVELY. Couldn t tell from pic but super shady patio with lots of tables and chairs.   Snag your corner store plant based and other junk foods in the same spot - a whole convenience store to boot.   Can t wait for try Fair Game pinsa and pasta whenever that opens soon   
Mission Street Burrito,9,Look no further than the crunch wrap  Better than I remember Taco Bell s ever being   We also got the nachos  but probably would not order it again. Crunchwrap we will come back for.
Mission Street Burrito,10,The food here is other level. Everything that comes out of this kitchen is PACKED with TLC  amp  flavor    Try the pasta dishes too. The garlic bread will haunt me....In a good way. 10 10
Mission Street Burrito,11,Best vegan food I ve ever had. You need to come here. The ice cream is also to die for.
Mission Street Burrito,12,I purchased food from this establishment via the Kitchen United Mix location on Burnet today. I ordered the Super Burrito with carne asada. This burrito is a great option for those who are looking for vegan friendly grub. I enjoyed the monster size burrito but the only caveat is that the  meat  was a little dry. I understand that plant-based meats can be on the dry side but this meat alternative was too dry for my liking. However  the overall combination of flavors derived from the Spanish rice  whole pinto beans  guacamole  pico de gallo   onions  cilantro  and spicy green tomatillo salsa gave the meat some texture.
Mission Street Burrito,13, 46 for a burrito bowl  a quesadilla and some chips  Wow. And this place is inside a convenience store for goodness sakes.   The food was good but not at that price point. For being a vegan place  I was also surprised that the burrito bowl had almost no greens 
Mission Street Burrito,14,Amazing vegan food   Porch eating located in University park I side the Austinite Market. Pet friendly too   Came for the Sunday Brunch - French toast and omelet. Highly recommend.  Try th Austin coffee as well -Ausrinite market. Best coffee. Friendly peeps  clean  and good food.
Mission Street Burrito,15,I have tried different vegan restaurants in many different cities of the US and let me tell you this place is the BEST.   I had a crunchwrap which was amazing. Be sure to order this. amazing.  nuff said. my girlfriend had a super burrito  she is a meat eater who hates mushrooms  she thought it was one of the best burritos she s ever had  her mom  strictly meat eater  had a missionary bowl with chicken which was also superb. the portion sizes were bigger than chipotle.   Tried to find their food truck but the location was wrong. Don t let the location being in a grocery store turn you away from this hidden GEM 
Mission Street Burrito,16,All vegan plant based eatery. I think this is a food truck  Can t be sure since I utilized Uber Eats to get the deliciousness to my hotel while I was visiting Austin.  My FAVORITE thing was the breakfast tacos  They allow you to create your own and you can order them all day long. I loaded mine with just egg  beyond breakfast sausage and hashbrown. They were loaded up with plenty of toppings in flour tortillas.  I also enjoyed their vegan take on the crunch wrap supreme. Wow  I would definitely order that again. Lastly  I ordered nachos and I ll skip those next time.. most likely because I ordered them for delivery so they were soggy by the time I got them.  My own fault  but I never learn my lesson   they were still delicious and I d recommend them to those walking up to their food truck to order   
Mission Street Burrito,17,I just paid  18 for a burrito in a convenience store. It s good  but holy hell it hurts my pocket. Keep Austin weird  I guess...
Mission Street Burrito,18,This place is hidden inside of a convenience store  truly making it a hidden gem  lol . As a vegetarian and native Texan  I often wish I could get big ole loaded burritos with vegetarian fillings -- it s harder to find than you think  Mission Street satisfied this craving 150 . My partner and I got their Super Burrito with mushroom and lentil  carne  asada and the regular nachos. Lucky for us  we came on National Ice Cream day  so we got to try their oat milk  OAT MILK     ice cream. We got the peanut butter and chocolate swirl soft serve and it was the best vegan ice cream I ve had in Austin  will be returning just for the ice cream itself. The order was ready quickly and both items were a hefty portion size -- we were only able to finish the nachos and ice cream  and took the burrito to go. Even reheated  the burrito was fantastic. Will be back for more ice cream and to try more of their vegan meats 
Mission Street Burrito,19,Delicious  Get the Crunchwrap  This place is so good. Really kind humans running it too    it s a bit pricey  so I probably won t be back as much as I would like  which would be eryday    But daaaayum  SO GOOD     
Mission Street Burrito,20,Mission Street Burrito is giving Taco Bell a run for their money. No joke. I got their Dorado Style Munchwrap which is essentially a vegan Crunchwrap Supreme. It actually tastes like the OG one. In fact  I argue it s better than Taco Bell s version because this one is actually filed very nicely with  Impossible  beef   cashew  queso   a crispy tostada  pico  lettuce  guacamole  and sour cream.  Aside from Sunday s  9pm close   they are open every day until midnight. So come on down and get you their delicious crunchwrap. You will not regret it. Look  vegan  beef  can sound intimidating or  weird  but I assure you  you really can t tell the difference. It s practically 1 1  so try it for yourself to see.
Mission Street Burrito,21,The best breakfast burrito I ve eaten. Sub beyond meat for mushroom and it ll get you right.
Mission Street Burrito,22,If you re hungry enough to eat a burrito the size of small child  you re in the right place. The tortilla torpedoes they re slinging at Mission Street Burrito are no joke. Loaded with beans  rice  Follow Your Heart cheese and sour cream  guac  pico  onions  and tomatillo sauce  you can upgrade that monster with Impossble or Beyond Meat too  as if that wasn t enough food to last you all day. There s no shame in taking home leftovers here. In fact  I d recommend it. You might hurt yourself trying to pound this beast all at once. Likewise  an order of nachos provide a veritable trough of food  enough for at least two servings. Even without adding any extras  you ll get one hell of a hearty meal.
Mission Street Burrito,23,We got takeout and I wish they packed the nachos ingredients separate from the chips... items are fresh  but need more guac and queso.
Mission Street Burrito,24,Good little vegan place. I got the super burrito  which was the size of a football  The staff was really nice  and the service was quick. There are benches to eat outside  no shade though. I liked that there is an option to  pray it forwards   you can donate whatever amount you want to help feed someone else.
Mission Street Burrito,25,Waited an hour for my food when the driver goes to pick it up they cancel the order wasted my time
Mission Street Burrito,26,It was so good   We got the nachos and the munch wrap and both tasted incredible and very filling  We got it while our friends tried franklins bbq  lol . I was pretty impressed.
Mission Street Burrito,27,I tried this for the first time last night  got the super burrito. If there was guac  sour cream or cheese  I didn t see or taste it. It was literally just rice beans and pico. I mean there was SO MUCH RICE. And sadly the rice and beans had zero flavor. I even added the carne asada and it had no flavor either. So for  14 you can get a rice and bean burrito with no flavor. Super disappointed. My friend got the breakfast burrito and that was good though.
Mission Street Burrito,28,Love Mission St Burrito. Great team  great cause  and love their burritos and Crunchwrap. They also use our Credo queso on their nachos which are delicious.  10 10 recommend 
Mission Street Burrito,29,Growing up a vegetarian in San Diego I was super excited to see a vegan  San Diego inspired  burrito spot in Austin  Omg I ve been waiting FOREVER for this  There s nothing like Baja me an food but  Let me tell you  this place is 100  OhhhhhhKay... not much flavor to the food. Definitely needs salt  seasoning and a variety of textures added to everything. They use Gardein meat that s very mild and basic  I feel like the rest of the ingredients follow that. It s owned by the same people that own Plow Bow   very good  Plow Burger  very ok  and Plow BBQ  not good at all . It s things super oily and a no of salt seem to be a trend with the Plow company. I know that here in Tx you make things taste good by frying it to add flavor but even as a vegetarian i know that you need some freshness to balance the favors  The burritos are supposed to come with guacamole and pico de gallo and I never get any. Want to love this place so much but I ve been here a number of times and have had everything on the menu  it s always the all the same warm oily mush.  things the same texture witt not much flavor. Maybe if there are some salt  and cut up onions  cilantro  This review would be a little different. One  because everything was decent besides what I went for... the food.
Mission Street Burrito,30,I love the burrito. It just seems different now. One half of the burrito was only rice and beans and the other side 1 4 of the burrito had the guac and cheese. The service was super awkward. When I arrived the girls working there had their back turned to me and didn t even care to acknowledge me and ask me to wait for them.
Autenticos Michoacanos,1,This place is tucked away in the back of an awkward parking lot behind a car wash. There are two windows on the food trailer  and it s never clear which you re supposed to go to when picking up or ordering--I ve never chosen correctly. Cheerful tejano music pours out of the windows while the exterior TV blasts reggaton music videos at the same time. At night the super bright LED light strips surrounding each window blind your eyes while you navigate the impenetrable language barrier.   It s mayhem  but I keep going back. That s how great the food is.
Autenticos Michoacanos,2,Great taco truck   I was recommended the quesobirria tacos. Bummer they don t come individually and only in orders of three. I wanted to try more.  The tacos were perfectly crispy and packed with cheese - good bang for the buck.  The highlight of the menu were the salsas. A creamy green and dark red made the tacos pop and had tremendous flavor.
Autenticos Michoacanos,3,Aaaaamaazing  We checked this place out after a friend s recommendation and we absolutely enjoyed the food. Wasn t ideal temperature wise since we were dying from the heat  but luckily we also ordered a watermelon smoothie which cooled us down.  The meat was great and the corn Tortilla quality was perfect. I would definitely recommend eating there since it comes out fresh. We initially ordered 3 tacos  bistec  barbacoa   amp  pastor   but saw someone else order the quesobirrias and had to try it ourselves. I m so had we did because the quesobirrias were amazing. They have two options  spicy and nonspicy with Pico de Gallo and a slice of avocado. They were both really good and the spicy definitely had a kick   which I love    Todos son sabrosos y iremos otra vez  y pronto 
Autenticos Michoacanos,4,Oh man oh man. These tacos were delicious. I will say that I thought I had a spice tolerance until I had these tacos. I got the spicy quesobirrias. It was SO delicious but also SUPER SPICY. My body was on fire.   Regardless it super great. The workers are super friendly too  Special shout out to the horchata for helping cool my system down a bit...not really... but it was great.
Autenticos Michoacanos,5,Amazing food. This is or should be an instant austin classic. Having spent time in Mexico this rises above typical Tex mex fare. I really enjoyed the watermelon juice 
Autenticos Michoacanos,6,This is a hidden gem  Located in a small unassuming trailer park  the menu will satisfy any of your cravings. The star of the meal was definitely the quesabirria  decadent  you will ask for more dripping consome to dip your tacos   The tacos are excellent  super fresh and flavorful. We ve tried 2 Aguas Fresca so far  mango and guava   both are made with real fruit and extremely refreshing.  This place has definitely become one of our favorite tacos trucks in Austin. Don t walk  run 
Autenticos Michoacanos,7,The tacos served at this food truck are amazing  they are some of the best tacos I ve had.  The tacos are authentic and have incredible flavor. I particularly enjoy the Carnitas and Chorizo tacos. The taco sauce was also very good  the green sauce had an amazing flavor and added a spicy element to the tacos. If you enjoy tacos and Mexican food you will not go wrong ordering from this food truck. Their food is better than most Mexican restaurants.
Autenticos Michoacanos,8,We go here every week or every other week   always nice hot and fresh never disappoint. The mangonada is a little too spicy but overall good . Price is great also great 
Autenticos Michoacanos,9,Spicy Quesobirrias were so dang good  Super Messy with grease and sauce dripping everywhere. Tacos were good too 
Autenticos Michoacanos,10,I love them so much. I could eat their queso birria tacos every single day. The menu is pretty extensive for a taco truck  but I ll never find out what else is good because  again  the birria. The people who run  own   the truck are always super friendly  and now that they ve moved to the new location  parking and getting in and out is better. AND CLOSER TO MY HOUSE. This is trouble.
Autenticos Michoacanos,11,Got the elotes  Al pastor tacos and birria. Tacos were great  birria a little dry and elotes were a little bland  I believe since we got it to go and not as much seasoning. Would eat again and stick to trying all the tacos 
Autenticos Michoacanos,12,Amazing food all around  they don t miss  I ve gotten delivery from them a couple times  but sadly they no longer deliver in my area. Nonetheless  I m definitely going back for their quesabirrias and machete quesadillas 
Autenticos Michoacanos,13,The Frescas are the best and the tacos are amazing simply delicious can t wait to try them again
Autenticos Michoacanos,14,Get the Quesabirrias. Salsas are very spicy. Mandarin jarritos. They always have good music too
Autenticos Michoacanos,15,I mean  the name says it all - they re truly authentic. They re the best tacos my husband says he s had  he s not vegetarian  and it s the most authentic I ve seen. They put a very generous amount of stuffing  meat protein .   Do have cash with you - CC not accepted. You can Venmo 
Autenticos Michoacanos,16,Great tacos   Could be cleaner but quesobirrias and pepino water was great also suadero highly Recomend mangonada was not as it say it was but it wa a good mango
Autenticos Michoacanos,17,Highly recommend  Never disappoint. The birria is delicious  agua de pi a and the elotes are bomb  My secret get away.
Autenticos Michoacanos,18,If you arrive in person  they ll prioritize online orders and make you wait at least 30min.
Autenticos Michoacanos,19,Let me tell ya why this is the best Mexican food truck in the south  I m from south Texas and this place hits home for me. Coming in hot with their homemade tortillas and salsa. The people who own this truck are extremely genuine every time we come. I personally recommend trying their migas taco birria taco  amp  chicharon taco  it s perfected to crispy goodness .  It s hit the spot every time.
Autenticos Michoacanos,20,Ordered on Door Dash. I was excited to try the queso birria tacos based off the reviews. The tacos came with no side  lemon  radishes etc.  and NO CONSUME  The whole point of birria is to have the costume to dip in  Very disappointed  Maybe in person experience is different but would NOT recommend Door Dashing from here.
Autenticos Michoacanos,21,dont come here. unflavored. spent  200 on food  amp  tipped. couldnt even get a box without paying for it. if i could leave no stars  i would.
Autenticos Michoacanos,22,Best tacos in the city.  I ve been here several times in the last month now  each time with at least one other person  and gotten spreads of different things and worked thru maybe half the menu. Constantly hits every mark  consistency  proper portion  presentation  seasoning  balance  timeliness .  All masa  pambazos  tacos  quesadillas  sopes  huaraches  is pressed and cooked to order.  Some places have lots of different meats  but end up seeming like they used the same timer  temperature and method to cook  nothing stands out. Here each protein is cooked to its proper texture  and full of flavor. You can taste the love and expertise in each order.   Two people take orders and cook. Super friendly and attentive each time.  They even have fruit desserts and drinks  like rusas  mangoneadas  and agua fresca made from a long list of somehow always perfectly ripe fruit  always enough chamoy and chile to balance it.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming at first but now we start planning our next order by the time we finish the current one. There is something for everyone here and none of it disappoints.
Autenticos Michoacanos,23,The food is good and a good value. I have repeatedly had issues with delivery handoff with Uber eats and have received missing items and an entirely incorrect order last time. You cannot connect with the restaurant as they speak zero English  which is understandable but a little frustrating for a business establishment catering to English speaking clientele. I ordered several of the sincronizada but received all pastor instead.
Autenticos Michoacanos,24,So delicious and juicy. I got the birria tacos and these are the best I ve ever had   I continuously go to this place for more
Autenticos Michoacanos,25,Best quesabirria tacos in town  I know this is said often around Austin about different places but I m from a small Mexican border town so I KNOW a good taco when I eat one. It s fresh  flavorful and the salsas are amazing. They have giant aguas frescas as well that are just as delicious as their food  It s a hidden gem inside the the St Elmo food truck park off south Congress. You will not be disappointed 
Autenticos Michoacanos,26,Birria Tacos were soggy and flavorless. Would not recommend. Practically inedible. Wait was about 20-30 min  not worth it.
Autenticos Michoacanos,27,Amazing. Never had a machete before  only a huge fan of the fanchise and Danny Trejo in general  and man  this was incredible. Got the campechana. Now I m a large human being but I was only able to put down half of the machete and one quesabirria taco. Its okay though because I can save them for later  So much flavor  the consome is good enough to be bought as a standalone. I pledge allegiance to Autenticos Michoacanos  And they re on Ubereats.
Autenticos Michoacanos,28,I ordered the Birria tacos and some carnitas tacos.  The birria tacos were AMAZING  so tasty  consome was spot on and for  11 absolutely worth the price  super filling and tasty  Their green sauce was great as well.  The carnitas sadly were pretty gross  lots of large chunks of fat  the meat tasted off  not very well Seasoned either and not in the slightest crispy. I took one bite and tossed both of them.   All in all  certainly worth it for the Birria  but I d stick to that.
Autenticos Michoacanos,29,Great little food truck whipping out quesobirria tacos  3 x  10 . The consome was on point and so was the burrito.
Autenticos Michoacanos,30,I ordered off Uber Eats. The food was delicious. Highly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic homemade tacos and quesadillas loaded with cheese. Not for the health conscious. I assume I may gain some weight after eating this  but you only live once right  - 
Autenticos Michoacanos,31,Excellent sopes de suadero  Very tender and tasty   My new favorite Mexican food spot  And outside patio  Perfect for social distance  
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,1,Got this place on Uber eats. The food is absolutely amazing  Got the Fajita Texanas for 2 and was only give 4 tortillas for 2 people. Would have loved more tortillas as the toppings far outnumbered the tortilla. I grew up in Southern California and this is almost just as good as the Mexican food I grew up on 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,2,We went here when they opened in late 2019 early 2020  and it was a typical nondescript Tex Mex food place  in both ambiance and flavor.   Prices were a little high for what we got.   The weirdest thing was that when we got to the bottom of our shallow chip basket  there was a giant home-made black pill  We alerted the waitress  who merely took it away. I wish I d taken a photo.  Careful what you find at the bottom of your chips and queso.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,3,I have been meaning to stop at this little place and finally had the chance. Look quick  because you can easily miss it  If you do  go a few meters further and turn into the little strip mall and meander over.  Being a Saturday  I needed a Menudo fix and fixed I did get  The Menudo is in a deep red broth  along with hominy and of course Cilantro  lime and onion on the side. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they used dried red chilies as a topping. I knew this little guy was going to be HOT  HOT it was  I was wolfing down the Menudo and giving a workout to the homemade tortillas. I gulped my ice water while sweating with the red chilies. Very good all around. The tripe to broth ratio was a tad slim  but this was quite a lot for a small  and south of  6.00.  The young lady serving was extremely friendly and kind. I tried to get a peek into the kitchen but the cook was moving so fast that I did not want to disturb his rhythm. Someone must have called in a huge order and they also have a drive up window. However  inside was nice and cool.  I definitely will be back. I was surprised at the the amount of items offered on the menu from this little place. I have some definite must haves in my mind. I also recommend the Menudo when it turns cold outside or if you are hungover  or down with a cold. I am still licking my lips.   Well done 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,4,I ordered to-go yesterday and found it to be pretty good. Nothing exceptional but tasty  run-of-the-mill Tex Mex.  Bean  amp  Cheese Nachos - Needed a bit of salt but easy to add. They were made on tostada shells instead of chips which was nice. It kept them from getting soggy on the drive home.  Shrimp Diablos  the bacon-wrapped shrimped  - These were nice. They seemed to be deep fried which made the shrimp a bit dry and chewy. They were definitely spicy   Milanesa Torta - I love a steak milanesa. The steak was a bit overcooked but still really good. I also like that they have lots of options of different meats and types of tortas.  My biggest problem was the horrible odor inside the restaurant. It smelled of sewage. There were three things of incense burning behind the counter but that was not helping. I don t know how people were eating inside the restaurant with that smell.   The last thing  that I hope they would consider is having people sitting at the table right at the front door. Every single person must pass them and that is risky during these times of COVID. That should be a table where guests are unable to sit to avoid  as much as possible  customers coming within 6  of each other.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,5,It was just okay a little expensive for the food was not very flavorful but a little bland hot sauce was mild but it was really clean in there   The Staff was eager to serve and quick  but I am full enough. I really was turned off by the incense smell it was too much .
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,6,Everything we ve had has been incredible. The steak poblano and chicken mole are standouts.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,7,Meh.  My friend and I went here to beat the heat outside and  hopefully  have a good Mexican meal.  The establishment was fine  nothing special  but we weren t expecting much.  We were seated right away. The complimentary chips were fine  the salsa was a little spicy  but that s okay. I ordered guacamole to go with the chips and found it to be a mushed up avocado with cilantro  tomato  and onion on a plate.  It had no flavor and I ended up putting salt on it to taste more than avocado.  I got a chicken burrito and it too had no flavor.  It was just chunks of chicken with refried beans  lettuce  and tomato.  I put salt on that too.  My friend got carne burrito and thought the same thing.  Go to a food truck and get more flavor for less money.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,8,Delicious food. I had Migas la Mexicans and addedd sliced avocado. Hubby had machicado tacos on homemade flour tortillas. My son had the Migas plate which included retried beans and fried potatoes and bacon. He also got the Barbados taco. He also got some grilled green peppers  Chile s toreadors  as a side. I preferred the red sauce and they liked the spicier green sauce. The food was prepared to order and came out quickly and nice and hot.  We have eaten at many taco spots in Austin and this one we would definitely come back.   I also want to mention our two servers were very sweet and attentive even though they also had a table of about 12-15 people to attend to.   Try it out   Nothing fancy on the inside but you do get to sit down and order.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,9,This is our new go-to breakfast taco spot. It definitely beats everyone in South Austin. The staff is always so friendly  and our tacos are always fresh  hot and delicious. We get bean and cheese  bacon  potato and cheese  and bacon  egg and cheese. I ve also recently tried the tacos de pastor. So good 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,10,I ordered a BBQ taco it was too fatty and looked like it was from the day before and was warmed in the flat pan...I ordered pork grind in salsa taco it looked dry and and blahhhh...no taste....I ordered a menudo..it s ok it like the valley or Mexico but it s almost there decent taste but needs to be cooked a little more to tough....now the service she was great and very attentive...I might come back I might not maybe I will try something different just because if the service that was given...
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,11,Outstanding  No secret these fine folks know how to cook up some down home Mexican food with a Tex-Mex flair. Service is friendly and I did t have to wait long considering it was a packed evening at this fine establishment. The chicken mole was phenomenal. A perfect combination of spices  chocolate  peanut butter layered right on top of a roasted quarter chicken. It s a dish made for a cold evening or a celebration  either way if this is abuela s secret then I m coming back for more.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,12,Friendly  welcoming staff and the best tacos in south ATX  Breakfast  lunch or supper 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,13,Bomb. People are so nice. Spicy salsa. Hot chips. Down home. Everything is good--steak poblano is particularly nice. They are new enough  amp  cool enough to let me customize my relleno. Red or green sauce  amp  picadillo  stewed chicken  beef or chicken fajita or shrimp. I upped the ante  amp  had it topped with queso Fresca  amp  onion--which is what they top their chilequiles with--where I got the idea.  amp  it s bomb. Love the place.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,14,I Always order their steak with cheese enchiladas  you won t find this amazing combo anywhere else  Their food is always well made  amp  delicious everytime I eat there and the staff is always kind.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,15,Amazingly good - esp the salsa  guacamole  pico de Gallo. The refried beans are BEYOND any I ve had. I love the carne asada  chicken dishes  Monterrey and the chipotle   queso  chicken or beef fajita nachos. Haven t tried much else  but plan to 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,16,I ve been here twice to the food truck they re operating out front  the green one. It has their sales tax name on their paperwork so I m posting here. The mangonada is SO GOOD. I am addicted. Just look at it  Glorious. Nice employees  and they take credit cards.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,17,I ve been wanting to try this place and lunch was a great option.  They re just up the street for me and I love that.  When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised at how clean it was.  It was late in the day for lunch  around 2 30  so we were the only ones there.  The server arrived quickly with chips and two salsas and took our drink order.  She came back to ask for our order.   I ordered the dish with the whole grilled catfish  veggies  and a salad.  My son and daughter-in-law ordered beef fajita taco salads.  While we waited for our food order we ate chips and salsa.  The chips were thicker than I like but they held up well under the salsa.  The red salsa was a bit thin for my liking  and not as spicy as I would like  but the green stuff was addictive    We got too cold in the restaurant  lots of ceiling vents  so we changed our order to a carryout. My daughter-in-law went to the car to wait  but then the restaurant turned off the AC.  That was very nice  but by that time we had already decided to take the food home with us.  It arrived in a few minutes and was all wrapped up to go.  At home  they kids  well  grown ass adults  were surprised there no beans or rice  I had to explain that comes with a bowl  not a salad  .  My catfish was okay  but didn t taste much like catfish.  And it must have been a baby catfish because it was smaller than I m used to.  Veggies were roasted and dry  and salad was laughable  shredded iceberg lettuce  one slice of tomato that was so not ripe that it was nearly white  and two small slices of avocado .    Looking at the reviews  I want to try it again.  Maybe next time I ll order something that have others have recommended.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,18,Wow  Delicious  I must recommend the Migas breakfast taco  Do yourself a favor and eat here. The chorizo is amazing  too   Yum 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,19,Excellent menu   Authentic wonderful Mexican food. I had a 3 enchilada plate with chicken  ground beef and steak. Flavors were soooo good. I will return soon and recommend to everyone who loves this cuisine.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,20,Excellent food  Had Abuelas plate and the chicken  pork and beef were all delicious. I particularly liked the pork which is saying something cuz I don t always like the pork. Kinda wish my Abuela cooked like this
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,21,I was disappointed because the food was tasteless and cold. It was expensive for not making sure it was of higher quality.  I m so sad  
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,22,Best tacos in south Austin  So authentic  fresh  and delicious    Breakfast tacos at its finest.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,23,I took my wife to get tacos she has a medical condition they would not let her in. Went right down the street where they re not discriminatory about my wife s condition . You would think you would want all the business you could get and not be discriminatory.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,24,Tasty chimichangas and customer service. Visiting this restaurant is like going to a friend s house to eat. Good hours.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,25,Spot on  green salsa is hot  red salsa is really  bright  as in lime. Chips are hot. Relleno is the bomb. Great fajitas enough for 2--but the BEST thing is the pico de gallo  amp  guacamole are the freshest I have had in this town. Just the best  I am now eating there at least twice a week. Staff is greatif you want hipster clean looking  amp  foo foo crap  don t come here  go to like  Chuy sbut this is a hell of a lot better  better than Beto s  amp  La Posada--also in neighborhood. My son loves the nachos. Anyhoo
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,26,I like to try many different Mexican restaurants in Austin so I yelped here. Glad I came here. The friendly family run this place. Food are delicious
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,27,Gave this place a try after reading other reviews and so glad we did   The whole family went and we were all happy and will go back. We had the chicken mole enchiladas  ceviche tostadas and fajitas tecanas. All were delicious. The fajitas for one was enough to share. Just ask for a couple extra of their homemade tortillas. The service was super friendly and welcoming.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,28,The chicken tortilla soup was DELICIOUS. I m from SoCal and have crazy high standards for my Mexican food  I ll be back  The homemade tortillas were EXCELLENT 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,29,This place is a hidden secret of deliciousness   Grandma really does have the secret recipes here 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,30,What a welcome and surprise to the area  The building isn t much to look at  but inside it is clean  welcoming  and has a cozy feel. Our waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Their complementary salsas are some of the best I ve had in a while  a break from some of the more bland ones out there that lack spice and flavor. The beef fajita meat was cooked absolutely perfectly  and they did not skimp on quantity when loading up their seafood tostadas. My only complaint is that the chips were not to my liking  a bit thick. No bar  but the waitress said feel free to byob  Sold.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,31,Do not waste your money here. I ordered enchiladas  and the cheese on top literally will not melt. The beans are either spoiled or they were refried with old bacon grease. My son ordered a side of French Fries and they smelled so foul I gagged. Everything went directly in the trash can. I am super disappointed.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,32,Amazing tortas  Aguas frescas And breakfast is sooo good  Stop by for sure and try this place 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,33,The food is just fine  service is good...I wouldn t go back. There are so many other places in the city with better taste.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,34,We were looking for a place to eat  my girls wanted tacos  and we found this place. It was delicious they ordered tacos de carne asada  meat was so tender and yummy.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,35,This place is great  Seriously the nicest  most hospitable people are working there. It s clean  large menu  adorable sayings painted on the wall. We didn t order a lot  trying to get just a quick snack in before a workout  but my boyfriend really liked the shredded chicken and chicken fajita tacos and my avocado taco was perfect. Chips and salsa were good too. They have homemade tortillas and we got a carrot  celery  orange and beet juice to go that was incredible. I didn t see a ton of vegetarian items on the menu but I didn t ask  and with how customer service oriented they are here  I know they d direct you to some options or make you something custom  just based on how great the staff is. Definitely recommend 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,36,Very good food  Great service. They have a juicer  I love  Great dinner and breakfasts options I habe been goong daily for a juice and also grab a bite if I m hungry
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,37,Authentic - buuuuuut the one time I went  there was a slight but certainly detectable sewer smell wafting in the restaurant from the restroom area. I don t think the restaurant had been open more than a couple of weeks so I get that they may not have had all the issues with the older building fixed yet  but they should not have opened without fixing the problem. It was definitely a sewer plumbing issue and not just someone-went-to-restroom-just-then issue. Not sure how they passed code  but it made me not step foot back in there.
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,38,Amazing  I had the steak poblano fajitas. They came out sizzling and with a full plate of fresh guac  rice and beans. So delicious  My hubby had the  6 lunch menu. I think it was carne guisada and cheese enchilada plate. He loved it. We will be back to try breakfast and dinner 
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,39,Service  10 10 Food 10 10 Desire to come back  very high  Girlfriends love and affection for picking this place for lunch  20 10
El Secreto de la Abuela 2,40,Been curious about this place because I live a couple minutes away  it was really good  I usually base Mexican places off of their basic enchilada and taco combo plate and then go from there if I have future visits  and the cheese enchilada here was pretty good  Nothing like the Tex-Mex bullsh t that floods this city  no bright yellow cheese  and the red sauce kinda reminded me of the enchilada sauce you d find along the west Texas Mexico border where I m from  minus the heat  but that could be because it s hard to find red chili with enough heat in this part of Texas. The taco was really good  no store bought shells here  They fry the corn tortillas to make their own taco shells  which is how it should be  And the meat and potato filling was nice and juicy  got caught off guard a bit because it had pieces of carrot but upon eating I couldn t even taste it. Rice and beans were tasty as well  one thing I wasn t too crazy for was the pastor taco I had ordered as a side item  It was good but idk it lacked flavor  but I mainly came for the other stuff and not the pastor taco anyway. And the salsas were fantastic  one review said  it was spicy  yeah no sh t it s spicy it s fcking salsa. All in all I ll tell my other El Paso friends who are depressed about the lack of good Mexican comfort food in this town to check this place out  and I ll probably be in next week to try some more  mole  perhaps  . Gracias abuelita 
La Palapa,1,After driving past this place for years  we finally checked it out for lunch the other day. We found good  solid Texmex lunch specials  and a sprawling menu that lures us back for further exploration. The Happy Hour looks tempting as well  with drink and appetizer specials.  I ordered the lunch Chicken Flautas  which were excellent. The two were bigger than I expected and tasted fresh from the fryer  and the rice and Charro beans that came alongside were very good. A few TexMex places have started upcharging for Charro beans instead of Refried  but La Palapa does not.  My guy ordered the Chile Relleno. He s from Chicago and refuses to pronounce  relleno  properly  but our server did not hit him over the head with the chips basket  and was kind and friendly throughout. He has a weird idea that the fried chile shouldn t be flattened before cooking  but said it tasted fine.   I liked the interesting architecture of the building and the friendly vibe. We ll be back.
La Palapa,2,Great Tex-Mex food  No frills but absolutely hit the spot. Service was great and everyone was incredibly friendly. Solid margaritas and Mexican martinis  queso flameado was some of the best I ve had  and fajitas were great too  Highly recommend.
La Palapa,3,Goto appt for a last minute dinner. Lots of choices. There s always a daily special so that s really nice. They have things on there like enchiladas  pollo  caldo all sorts of yummy stuff so it s always a good idea to go for the special
La Palapa,4,Food was mediocre  not something to brag about but it was good. Our server didn t really understand us so that was hard to have a language barrier when trying to order  very sweet and attentive just we couldn t really communicate. Food came out prompt though.
La Palapa,5,Aside from inexplicably bringing my orders to the table in to-go packaging twice  this is some of the best tex-mex in town  My favorite highlight is how they cook their quesadillas to the perfect even golden crunch. I can t complain about the servers seeming a little clueless  because it s a side effect of just how fast they are  and yet they always manage to stay friendly. I ve never had a problem getting a table here right away. Food is always exactly as expected. The Pollo Avocado is another favorite for my keto friend. He clearly doesn t look like he s getting  diet food  with their big portion of tender chicken topped with plenty of cheese  avocado  and tomato. Their water glasses are  according to my friend  comically huge.  When I said that was one of my favorite things about it here  he knew I was only half-joking. We rarely get thirsty waiting for a server to come back with more water. Now that I ve tried their flan  I ll have to order it with every meal.
La Palapa,6,when I first walked in  a waiter pointed me in the direction of her section not knowing I wanted to sit at the bar. Once she noticed I wanted to sit at bar waiter became disrespectful and treated me as if I was a problem because I was no longer in her section. I ordered the burrito came out cold  hair in food. very unpleasant experience and I ll never come back. they use chili sauce instead of real enchilada sauce. a scam mexican restaurant
La Palapa,7,Cory was so helpful on the phone   I ve been dining here occasionally for the past couple years. Love their frozen mango margaritas with chimoy  Great value and great quality. Sheesh   Also love that Cory  who ive never met before  was super knowledgeable about food and beverage pricing and takeout protocol. Haven t visited in the last few months but after today I will have to remember to come by more often    Thanks y all 
La Palapa,8,Great food and drinks and the staff is super friendly   It has a dine in area and a bar area so it s a great place to go  Great manager Rosa
La Palapa,9,I really enjoyed this restaurant  Went with my girlfriend  we said we d try it eventually. I m from an area that has hot weather and even hotter foods. I m not overly fond of Tex Mex just because everything is so mild in flavor  amp  little to no spice. I judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa and it had a great kick too it  which reminded me of my favorite restaurants back in New Mexico.   I definitely recommend this place  the service was fast  the waitress was awesome  And the mango margarita was superb  I wish I would of taken some photos of our plates. We got the street tacos  amp  the Trio Enchilada plate  Was delicious  I recommend going here 
La Palapa,10,I was driving and looking for a place to eat for a quick lunch and the sign from the freeway looked nice.  Easy access from the freeway and plenty of parking available.  Food unfortunately was uneventful. Good price for lunch and huge portion size. Food tasted okay and if I have a chance  I would probably look for something else.  Service was good and I was in and out quick. That s what I came in for and I got a quick lunch.
La Palapa,11,Horrible Low quality Extremely overpriced food   Word of advice  never try the burritos they re complete trash   So much tortilla and very little fajita I think I got like maybe three bites out of the whole burrito  by the way no cheese  no beans or anything inside the burrito besides the meat. Where I m from that s just a taco. Very bland  very unsatisfying and to top it off we paid  40 for two burrito plates. I honestly wish I can get my money back  horrible food and horrible cooks plain and simple
La Palapa,12,My roommate had heard of this place at his restaurant that he works out so we decided to pop in after one of his shifts. I don t know what to honestly say. The vibe was UNBELIEVABLE  it felt like coming Home even though I m from New York  If that makes any sense at fall. They were so friendly  the drinks were great  frozen Margarita   the food was on point with my roommates approval  he s from Mexico   the Happy Hour is awesome  the environment is cute as Hell and did I mention the Vibes already  If I could rent a room above the place I would. Just writing this I might actually run over and grab a quick beer just to recharge. The only complaint I have is that I didn t know they existed sooner.
La Palapa,13,all burger places in austin...level up this place is changing the game on you all   and the prices can t be matched    
La Palapa,14,La Pa-loveit. This is such a hidden gem  Incredibly charming decor in a really unique old building. The food is good enough to eat  the prices are reasonable  and the happy hour goes to 7  The staff are super nice as well. Five stars  great place.
La Palapa,15,Initially we waited 10 minutes before a waitress ever approached us.  We of course had time to review the menu and gave our order.  It took a while to get our order but eventually it arrived.   The Ranchero beans were canned ranch style beans. The enchilada sauce was old and inedible. Then we had to hunt down our waitress to get any service.   So Disappointing.  Never again.
La Palapa,16,I ve come here once before a few years ago.. wasn t very wowed. However  this time I think it was better service and the food was decent.   The margarita is what gave it the fourth star though. Their salsa is pretty tasty and I do not mind the chips either.  They have multiple different sections  very old building  and I know they have karaoke on certain nights as well. They also have a decent happy hour and a jukebox as well as a decent sized stage.  I will be back either during Happy Hour or Karaoke.
La Palapa,17,We recently had a celebration at this location and first we were quickly accomodated for large seating  yet in the process of ordering our items  it seemed very slow. Not just that we only had one server for a group of almost 10 and along with the other tables she had to handle as well.  It was quite disheartening to have such stressed service and after a while it seemed like we were much easily  ignored for only 2 our of our party were ordering liquor  the server seemed more concerned with happy hour time than just regular good service .  My family and I have always had much better experiences  in times prior  yet this time I have seriously doubt we will return often for other occassions.
La Palapa,18,Decidi darle una oportunidad a este restaurant que queda de paso a mi casa  al llegar nos recibieron y desde alli supe que no estaria del todo bien. Nos dijeron que podiamos pasar a sentarnos en una mesa pero en ese momento llego una mesera diciendo NO pasenle para aca   y despues una tercera dijo alli se pueden sentar. Cuando nos pasamos la mesera llego a pedir las bebidas y traia una actitud de que no queria estar alli   despues trajo las bebidas y comenzo a tomar la orden y parecia que era nueva . Al final trajo la cuenta y se habia agregado su propina siendo que eramos 4 adultos un ni o y un bebe . Talvez yo hubiera dejado un poco mas de propina siempre y cuando me hubiera atendido bien ..
La Palapa,19,Food  OK.  Service  Lackluster  if not outright disinterested.  One of my work colleagues and I decided to give La Palapa a try for lunch after we realized that another nearby favorite was closed on Mondays. We also remembered other work colleagues said this was a regular favorite.  After my experience  I may not trust those colleagues.  The summary is thus  these folks can t handle a lunch rush at all.  We spent well over an hour here for lunch. Our server was absent for extended periods  including even taking our order. In fact  we went quite a while between one person getting our drink order and our actual server coming by to get our lunch order.  As for the food itself  I m still not sure what we got.  My colleague ordered a fajita taco with just cilantro.  She also got onion.  Unfortunately  our service had been so slow that neither of us wanted to invest the time in getting what we ordered. My enchiladas were good  but my two cheese enchiladas each looked different and each had a different sauce.  Not bad by any means  but beyond unusual.    The saving grace here was their thin red salsa which packed a surprising punch.  So  if you must come visit  come when there s no crowd.
La Palapa,20,First meal out after the snowpacalypse. Super yummy mole chicken and great drinks  The flan was wonderful too  
La Palapa,21,So sad James and karaoke are no longer happening here. That s THE only reason I frequented this spot over the years because the food and the service are just ok. Their drinks are also not great. Very very sugary margaritas  so the only think that s worth drinking is draft beer. Wonder where James ended up  He was amazing and could find just about any song you could possibly think of. His karaoke was so much fun    Too bad he is no longer here. I won t be going back as there s just no reason to anymore. Rats in the cantina  a bathroom that usually floods  Nope  No reason at all to go now. James if you ever read these  THANK YOU for so many years of great times.
La Palapa,22,I wouldn t recommend La Palapa for the food..kinda blah  greasy   amp  not fresh at all    BUT I would recommend La Palapa for the drinks  amp  karaoke   .  The 3 stars is for the drinks  amp  karaoke..which is SO much fun watching people get up  amp  sing like they re Mariah Carey or Luther Vandross      A few helpful tips when checking out La Palapa ..  -Happy Hour is 7 days a week 4pm-7pm BUT you only get the Happy Hour specials if you are seated in the bar section which is on the side of the karaoke stage   -Karaoke Nights are every Friday  amp  Saturday..oh yea    -There are Karaoke rules..yes rules   ...one of them being if you are to drunk to walk straight then no singing ..nothing worse than listening to a drunk wannabe Mariah Carey     Oh  amp  FYI  La Palapa s location is very old..like so old the floor kinda sinks in some spots so just watch your step.   Be Calm  amp  Karaoke on...  Rebecca out..drop the mic
La Palapa,23,I ve always enjoyed La Palapa. Service and Food is Good. Getting a little harder to get good Austin Tex-Mex Food. Hope they are open for business now. Tried calling Friday afternoon  but no answer. Update Called today  a lady said the Dining Room is Open. And to come visit.   
La Palapa,24,I ve come here for lunch a few times and the food is mediocre  nothing to rave about though.   However  I have heard good things about the drinks karaoke  so I will have to come back to try that.
La Palapa,25,It was decent food don t get me wrong but when there are three other tables in the whole restaurant and it takes you ten minutes to get me a sweet tea refill that is a problem. I asked for more salsa and good luck I never got that. PISS poor service for sure.
La Palapa,26,Great food  parrillada was great  all the condiments  and charro beans xx Rita well frozen and services was excellent  totally love this place.
La Palapa,27,3rd time  and consistently good. Is it perfect  No. But no place is. The service is fantastic The Cantina is chill They will make anything you want to drink or eat. The portions are huge. The food is very flavorful and fresh. It s never slammed  thus always get a table. And the to go is epic. Tonight we got fajitas for 2 and they did a bang up job packing everything we needed.  Way better the Tres Amigos down the street.
La Palapa,28,This was place I used to frequent often. They have new menu  so I decided to order a beef fajita torta with Monterrey Jack cheese  avocado  side of mayo and french fries.  I even thought to myself  that s a simple torta  cool. It s what I was looking for. When the food arrives  it was loaded with lettuce  tomatoes  and jalape os  none of which was mentioned in the menu because if it had I would asked for it without. When I told the waitress I didn t want jalape os her response was   You didn t tell me.   She took it back to kitchen and brought it back that s when I got a better look at the fries. They looked kind of old like they had been sitting out for a bit and the ketchup had a sour taste to it. On my way out the door I picked up the menu to confirm the description of what I had ordered and I was right.  Not sure I m going to back anytime soon.
La Palapa,29,service was slow even with very few people there and my friend waited 10 minutes for a sweet tea refill and this man was thirsty if they are going to serve spicy salsa then they need to be paying attention to their few customers drinks. Also the food was not very good  my 12 year old brother could put five chips on a plate and cover it with cheese better than that. And to add to that  we never got the salsa we asked for...also there was FLIES flying around the food.
La Palapa,30,La Palapa is controversial.  If you read the other Yelp reviews  you will see lots and lots of Yelpers telling terrible stories.  When I was there  in the middle of a Sunday afternoon  the place was crowded and people kept coming in the door.  For a  terrible  place  they sure seem to have a lot of satisfied customers.  The crowd was one third black  one third hispanic and one third white Anglo.  I am guessing the crowd was heavily local East-siders.  The only Yuppie in the house was me.  My food was completely fine.  More on that later.      My suspicion   Neighborhood people and regulars get one level of food   Their food is pretty good.  Other people may or may not get that same level of food depending on circumstances.  The stories people tell of screws in food or pieces of tomato slicer in food or brown guacamole -   These stories sound to me like the food served to customers the house does not want to see again.  Does this represent the views of management or just the views of one or two rogue employees    Who can say      For what it is worth  I have always eaten well there - and my last visit was no exception.  I stopped in recently for nachos.   Unlike most other places - here they have three different dishes they call nachos.  I got the Tex-Mex nachos.  This was about a half a pound of ground beef  a ton of queso and a load of pickled jalapeno slices all dumped on the tortilla chips.  The serving was huge.  They intentionally used queso rather than melted cheese  so everything got completely soggy in no time flat.  The cheese sauce melted the chips and then mixed in with the hamburger.  This made the nachos a fork and knife dish and not a finger dish.  It was in essence Mexican hamburger casserole  but it was good Mexican hamburger casserole and I was happy to have it.     My hunch - take it for what it is worth   I have always gone there by day - including my most recent trip which was on a Sunday afternoon.  Everyone was in the restaurant  no one was in the cantina and drinking was negligible.  The food has been good all the way around.  A lot of the horror stories seem to take place at night. Karaoke night seems to be particularly problematic.  Does this place have two modalities    Day vs night    Restaurant vs cantina    Normal crowd vs karaoke crowd   Who can say 
La Palapa,31,Update  3 2021  This place stays great  It is now our go-to restaurant for TexMex.  Highly Recommended 
La Palapa,32,Good  solid Mexican tex mex food.   I normally go around 5 30 pm on Thursdays  and the crowd is not heavy.  Service is attentive.  Always knowledgeable and supportive about dietary limitations.
La Palapa,33,Food hasn t been good for the last 6 years.  Soggy enchiladas  shredded cheese on nachos.. Like why   Food is ready to quick so I doubt anything is fresh. The drinks are strong though
La Palapa,34,Amazing salsa   I don t say that very much cause most places are just ok. It s hot but not just perfect. Love the decor and the service. It s a find for sure   Ordered street tacos also great  I just can t say enough. Ask for Aaron he s the bartender.
La Palapa,35,La Palapa has a bar area and a restaurant area and I prefer the laid back feel in the bar. I love the pi a colada Aaron makes  This is my favorite happy hour spot in this area. Happy hour is every day 4-7 and they have a great variety. Can t go wrong ordering some enchiladas. Plus the karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights in the bar is so fun to watch 
La Palapa,36,I will never go back.  Food and drinks were average. Service was horrible.  One of the servers spilled salsa and it went all over our shoes  pants and a purse. Plus if you have five people at your table they put an automatic gratuity on your bill.  So you get to pay for bad service. Nice 
La Palapa,37,Kids were happy   grandma was happy   and I was happy with the food  ... and the price was reasonable... and the atmosphere was great   Considered giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because salsa was too spicy  but then again  that s a plus  because we hardly had any chips...   Kids meal for  5 AND they actually ate the food    My  Healthy Meal  fajitas were AMAZING   I m not quite sure how  healthy  they really were  but the taste was great   and the portion size was good.  Service was good...with an asterix - only a handful of tables were there...
La Palapa,38,After going there yesterday   I can see why they only have a three star rating. The food and drinks are over priced and not that good. The manager  Angela is also extremely rude and not willing to adjust tabs due to unfair pricing.  They charged me  1.50 per shrimp without telling me the price and I didn t realize it until I got my tab. Because of her treatment of me and my friend and her unwillingness to adjust my tab  I didn t tip the waitress I had and I ALWAYS tip. In addition to that   people are able to walk in with no masks  take temps  wear gloves  etc.   It appears they don t do anything to make sure the spread of Coronavirus will be limited. I will never go there to spendcmy money again. With that 3 star rating  I m clearly  not the only one who feels that way.
La Palapa,39,Delicious as always I tried to take a photo of my Burrito before I attacked it    Clean restaurant friendly wait staff.
La Palapa,40,My first visit to La Palapa and I was very satisfied with it. The food was good and the service was fast and friendly. The price was very reasonable for the portions we received. The atmosphere was good too- not too many frills. I will definitely be back.
La Palapa,41,Read all the reviews about  Poor Customer service and I believe them so here is another review about Poor Customer service.  Here is mine about   Poor Customer service and they just lost a customer and then some when I reach out to my friends.   Manager did not tried to make situation right with customer on which i bought a large hot sauce and 6 tacos  got home to find out hot sauce and chips were not there called them and gave my name to whoever answer and to come back and they would make it right so i did and the male manager gave me a small hot sauce I told him I paid for a large hot sauce and would not give me what I paid for.  Taking  advantage of the elderly and arguing  with me really over something petty like hot sauce.  I m going to reach out to friends and family to boycott this establishment . You lost my business and others.  You suck.
La Palapa,42,Decided to try out this place. It s not bad  and actually pretty good for the price. As a vegetarian  I was surprised that they had options. It s nothing fancy special  but it s clean  well priced  and has decent tex mex food.
La Palapa,43,Austin owned.. Don t have a reunion gathering here.  You will be sadly screwed.  Shame on you La Palapa.
La Palapa,44,i went and got over charged  asked for queso and never got it  they tried charging me for it and plus all i wanted was an extra taco and ended up getting 2 i said okay  then i got charged  4 for each small taco.
La Palapa,45,I ordered beef tacos with rice and refried beans of the lunch menu. Got to work with my food. They forgot the beans  
La Palapa,46,My wife and i work at home and own 4 businesses . One thing we like to do is get out and be social at the end of the day. We pick places with atmosphere but the big secret is we will go back to places that have a great team in place who is inviting kind and friendly. Tonight we meet Aaron who was truly a heart warming gentlemen. He tried really hard to please and went out of his way to be friendly. People like him are hard to find and because of people like him we will be back   Truly thank you Aaron   See y all soon salsa was amazing  skinny like margarita was also good  
La Palapa,47,La Palapa has been a staple karaoke and happy hour restaurant in East Austin for years and last night the experience was the worst I have ever experienced. Don t get me wrong  its no Pappasitos but I do expect the basics. I expect to be acknowledged when I arrive and asked if I would like water or even a drink. I would like to receive flatware when you bring out the food that I have ordered and Iw oule expect a general smile here and there.  When I arrived to join my party there were about 9 10 ladies already seated  having appetizers and drinks. I waited about 10 15 minutes for a waiter and no one ever appeared. Two additional ladies joined our party and within 5 minutes they had drinks    Another lady that arrived before me said she never received ANYTHING and graciously refused to order after that point. We were the only party in the Cantina and could not understand why there was such confusion with waiting on our table effectively. I eventually received my food  with no silverware and had to call her back over after she finally reappeared after about 6 7 minutes all the while my food is getting cold. A lady with our party called the waiter over and questioned the gratuity and their policy since we all knew that they establishments stopped placing the gratuity on the bills and gave the patrons the option. However  there was no option and it was totally placed in the overall total. The waitress got upset  assuming for lack of knowledge of the policy and offended she was questioning her customer service and not thinking she deserved the tips.  The waitress basically bucked at our friend and she told her that she would beat her ass for being disrespectful to which the Manager finally appeared after many of us summoned him over  and he took his time and shooed us off twice before coming  then the first thing he says is the waitress said someone said they were going to stab her      WTF    Listen  if this was a joke on this older white Caucasians part  it was not funny at all because that falling upon the wrong ears could have def caused a life or death situation for our party had someone misunderstood and called the cops.   This new Manager  Gerald  never once tried to understand what was going on  did not care that his waitress had been disrespectful and basically told us we were done there for the evening. Tallied all of our checks out and nonchalantly  with no words expected us to leave. Which we kindly obliged him.  He will not have a successful business with this little hostile waitress on staff. They have already done away with karaoke. I see another staple establishment in our community getting ready to make a turn and no longer be what it was. I m wide awake to what is really going on at La Palapa and will not be surprised when it is no longer visited by minorities in the community.   Rishonna Kindred
La Palapa,48,I will not be going back here any time soon.  Food was meh.  Not too fresh.  Service...the same.  And one of the people eating at our table found a screw  yes a screw in her salad.  The response when this experience was shared was poor.  Oh...we are doing some work in our kitchen.  Something to do with ventilation or something.  I immediately thought...ugh.  If a screw got in  I wonder what else did.  Why did no one notice things falling into the food   Thank fully her tooth was not broken.  After some discussion they said sorry.  No offer was made to comp the meal.  Finally one of our more senior diners said   maybe you should give her this meal and a gift certificate to see if she trusts you enough to come back.   Well  they did.  I am not sure if she will come back.  Very strange.  REally the food is not good enough to warrant another visit.
La Palapa,49,This place is crawling with COVID  The last time we went there were roaches everywhere. The food was terrible and our server was super unhelpful  STAY AWAY 
La Palapa,50,Haven t been to La Palapa in years.  Decided to try again and was pleasantly surprised.  Arrived about 2 00 pm on a Wednesday.  They weren t busy at all.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.  Went to the restaurant side  not the cantina.  Had the chile relleno lunch plate.  Three dollars cheaper than the Tres Amigos serving and twice as large.  My friends got Chicken enchiladas and a sampler plate.  Their plates are the size of pizza pans.  We all took home leftovers.  Everything was excellent.  The food came out piping hot and tasted fresh.  So yummy.  This will be my new go to place for Mexican food cravings.  We needed some more good restaurants on the upper east side.  Glad to see that La Palapa has upped their game.
La Palapa,51,I dined at La Palapa for lunch on Tuesday  December 22nd.  I arrived early for a client meeting  and the waitstaff allowed me to sit in the dining room and wait until my client arrived.  My waiter was very friendly and attentive  and kept stopping by asking if I needed or wanted anything.  Once my client arrived  we ordered lunch.  I had the Tex Mex Enchiladas which came with a choice of beef  chicken  or cheese enchiladas with a sauce of my selection  and was topped with Tex Mex queso. The plate was also served with rice and beans.  I m a big eater  so I opted for the three enchiladas and ordered one of each.  All the components of my meal were served piping hot  and the enchiladas were really good.  The amount of beans and rice to compliment the enchiladas were perfect   Everything tasted really good  and if and when my travels bring me back to Austin  I would eat here again 
La Palapa,52,I really love La Palapa. I grew up on their food and their tilapia with the vegetables is AMAZING. For kids  their burgers are great and their regular burger is a great size for the price. They also serve virgin drinks that are amazing. Their virgin pi a colada is amazing. They re under new management which still keeps the same flow but they ve changed the authenticity of the old place. I love the restaurant so much and the staff. They keep the humor going. 5 5 stars.
La Palapa,53,The waitress was extremely nice and helpful. The food was yummy  BUT..... We drove all the way over from Round Rock for karaoke. My boyfriend called earlier in the evening to make sure they would be having karaoke and they said yes  It was supposed to start at 8  so by 8 30 we asked the waitress and she said   Well  we are supposed to have it today  but if he thinks it s slow he will leave...so he left.  Can I just say...HOW THE HECK DID HE KNOW IF IT WAS SLOW     HE NEVER STARTED     And can I say there were quite a few people in the bar. Ugh    Of course we already ordered and ate and drank  VERY DISAPPOINTED      I am only given 2 stars instead of 1 because our waitress was so sweet 
La Palapa,54,Pleasantly surprised. Was a Tuesday so didn t try the margs and will be a good excuse to go back. I m particular about salsa and at first i was questioning the runniness  i like mine chunky and its gotta have cilantro  but all the flavors were there  and i had my typical 3 bowls. I had the beef fajitas and the meat was great not chewy or grisly like some places pass off for food. Mom had the mole  enchiladas which she loved  as the sauce had just the right amount of choca flavor. My chicky had the cheese enchiladas w carne sauce which she enjoyed but too much food. Evidence that they are making improvements to the building  new windows in patio area.
La Palapa,55,Best place to eat in the area on lunch   No wait and I always get fast good food and service. Food is always good and consistent  The manager must train the employees really well or just knows how to pick em lol . I love the grilled veggies and the salsa and chips is good
La Palapa,56,Good Lord this place just gets worse. We went for a birthday party for a friend and it was disaster from the get go. We arrived shortly after 6 because apparently the website states karaoke starts at 6  when it actually starts around 8 30. 3 of us ordered Mexican Martinis. What we got was water and olive juice. No joke  That is exactly what they were. We sent those back and got frozen margaritas. A little better  but not by much.  We then ordered food.While we were waiting for the food the power went out. A guy walked around to each table and said everything would be 50  off for the inconvenience.  I had the queso. It was ok. The flaming cheese was disgusting  Tortilla soup  How do they call that  soup   We had them clear the table without eating much. After some interesting karaoke  the waitress came around and said their credit card machine was broken and we needed to pay cash. We all asked for our bills. What a mess  Drinks that were not mine  no discount on the food. When we pointed it out to the waitress she asked who told us it would be 50  off. One of my friends had to follow her in to the kitchen to find out who said it. They then took the discount. My bill was fixed on the first try  but others at our table had to have it fixed 3 times.  The karaoke is fun  but that would be the only reason to come here. If you do go  check your bill carefully.
La Palapa,57,We had dinner  there last night. When we got there  service was a amazing. I ended up  eating a carne guisada plate. I specifically  said no pico or jalape os. What comes in my plate..... the stuff I asked not to put. Almost done with my meal. I kid you not. I chewed a rock. I spit it out  hoping that I didn t crack my teeth. We asked to speak to the manager. They apologized what not. After that  the service from the bartender was crap. Wouldn t even check on us. Disappeared  to who knows where. We would ask for a drink  she was just rude. Then it s 12  we know that they were closed. We were trying to finish our drink. She comes over and is literally rude. Saying we closed at 12. Hello  you made us a drink. I wasn t happy with the service or the bartender. I wouldn t go back. And we ve been there many times before. I felt like  they were blaming me  for the rock. Thankfully  I didn t choke or crack my teeth. Please be kind to your guest  next time . Hopefully  this doesn t happen again to someone else. Will not be going back  get your service in order please
La Palapa,58,Can your service be too good  Can your queso flameado be too flameado  Can your fajitas be too flavorful  I say no. Look  maybe it s because i had four tecates before this but the food was damn good. And frankly  I remember it being good last time i was there. It s empty empty empty but our server had these crazy butterfly earrings  checked on us a LOT and everything came out incredibly fast. And not in a bad way.  We got queso flameado  yellow melty cheese in a bowl does NOT   queso  with chorizo  poblano and mushrooms. That sh t was on fire. Seriously. Pretty blue flames spouting from melty white cheese with all the accoutrements. Its kind of amazing. Next we got the fajitas for two. No minor portion this. Both of us got our own rice and beans a la charra  our own molcajete with guac  sour cream  cheese and pico de gallo  and enough meat so that I have a to go box. That s after two good eaters attacked it like we were on a wilderness show.  How were the margaritas you ask  Huge. Strong as Arnold. Actually quite good in a city that insists that margaritas should be made with sweet and sour tragic enough to coat your larynx for days. If you re thinking mexican food  check out la palapa. Have a new adventure. Karaoke on Fri Sat. Try some cheese on fire. Why the hell not 
La Palapa,59,I came with my family and I don t recommend this place the food was gross and the customer service was bad   they charged us 230 dollars when at chuys for the same food and better food   We pay 100 like rip off i swear  
La Palapa,60,Service is fine  the food needs a bit more love into it.  I had enchiladas that were a bit dry. The prices are fair.
La Palapa,61,I love this place. I live nearby and usually visit once a week. The staff is very friendly.  The service is prompt  the food never takes long  and the servers are always very attentive to getting refills and stuff.  From the chips and hot sauce to the tilapia Monterey  everything I ve eaten here has been delicious.  Their chicken enchiladas are the best I ve had in Austin.   The atmosphere is cool  it s kind of like a thatched hut with a fountain in the middle.  There s a cantina in the back. Prices are very reasonable. Portions are huge.  Give this place a shot. Do not go to Tres Amigos down the street.
La Palapa,62,I can only imagine the people who give this place 5 stars don t get out much. The service was dead slow  the beef fajitas were as tough as shoe leather  and the guacamole was brown. I told my wife to take a picture of it  it really was disgusting  but we were at a birthday party and she said that would be rude. I told her what s really rude was that I was dragged to this place on an empty stomach.  To top things off  the waiter brought back my check and kept asking me about the business name on my card and what I did. I got a bad feeling about all his prying  and sure enough two weeks later FRAUD on my account at two local Target stores.  With all the great food in Austin I can t believe this place even exists.
La Palapa,63,YUMMY MARGARITAS FOR MY TUMMY If you want a great margarita  this is the place to go.  The cantina is a great place to meet some friends for a CASUAL Happy Hour.  Prices are great and they serve free food.  The wait staff are very  very nice and the bartenders are down to earth.
La Palapa,64,I hadn t been at this restaurant in a while.  I enjoyed the margarita and the Tri Color Enchiladas.  They were delicious.  Our waitress was nice and attentive.  We had an issue with our bill that was corrected.  The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I believe when the bill issue was going on  the person in charge of fixing the issue kept on asking me how she wanted me to fix the issue.  I don t think that was up to me how to correct it on a register considering I don t work there.  But I m not saying I m not coming back or that the place is a bad place to visit.  The food was awesome.  The waitress apologized because it was a mistake she made that created the issue.  I m not giving up on them.  More attentive towards money issues  that s all I ask and I m a happy customer.   - 
La Palapa,65,This place used to be my favorite place for pollo chipotle since 1999  but  after either change of ownership or change of chef  the food just went down the hill. Now  they don t even know how to make the chip and salsa correctly. The chips taste like cardboard.  To add salt to the injury  the price had also gone up. So  you not only get worse food than what you used to get  but also charged more for the rip off. I am surprised it s still in business.
La Palapa,66,Ate here because it was close and open  and man am I glad I did. I was craving mexican food  but it was hard to find some place that is open after 9pm.   I was very impressed with the food  and I basically loved everything about my dish and am surprised this place only received 3 stars. Sorry Austinites  but I m from Fort Worth and I know mexican food. This was authentic and well prepared even late at night. If I lived in the area I d be back 
La Palapa,67,This place rocks. Kinda divey  and a little rough around the edges  but a lot of fun. The karaoke DJ is a riot  and people always have a blast when they go up to sing. You get some grimace inducing singers  of course  haha   but there s also some legitimately good singers who frequent here.  Drinks are cheap  and the servers and most of the people who come here are really chill. Get a Vegas Bomb for 6.75.
La Palapa,68,Wait staff friendly and very attentive. I enjoy my mexican food and I know what s good.. This place has good food  Atmosphere is nice for any  occasion  Prices are very fair   No complaints Place was clean
La Palapa,69,So this is how  our second day went here. On Saturday night whoever served us was the best waiter I ve had in a minute. He was VERY attentive to us. Now Sunday service is a whole other story. Not only we had to wait 15mins to get our order taken with literally nobody in the restaurant due to our waitress on the phone and talking among other employees  we had to flag her down and ask others to go get her. So when the check came out and she tried to add her  20 tip of course our table felt she wasn t worthy of that much. Long story short we were threatened to have to cops called on us just for the manager to arrive 15 minutes later and completely ignore what the issue we had with the employee. His solution was paying the the horrible waitress her  20 tip and telling us how we don t need to be there and how we should dine at a McDonald s because they tip all waitress here. HA. NOT THAT RUDE PERSON WE NOT    For us to have been spending years at this establishment and spending amble amount of money here we will NEVER recommend here again. Oh and to thE female who thought it Was cute to cuss me out in Spanish thinking I didn t understand  hopefully you get a chance to go to school and get a degree and do something better with your life. Cause the next  customer may not be as nice as me to let you slide.
La Palapa,70, Is draft from a bottle ok  I ll give you a glass.   The service was beyond subpar. I wouldn t call it terrible or miserable  instead just plain bad. The only thing that had to get sent back was the check for not having any of the happy hour pricing on it  6pm on a Friday and they were only one third full .  The salsa was chopped raw onions and jalape os put in canned spaghetti sauce. Atrocious.  My friend and I shared an appetizer platter. It tasted like it was prepared days before and just microwaved to warm it up. The queso was pickled peppers and Velveta. The guacamole wasn t fit to be pawned off on people I dislike but feel socially obligated to invite to parties.  The manager was too busy staring at the ladies as they exited to building to be of any real use to any of the staff. Which is frustrating  as he was the only one able to run the till.  It s definitely not the worst restaurant I ve ever been to. But  I will not be coming back. I d recommend Costa Del Sol for El Salvadorian food that s just up the road at Cameron and 183.
La Palapa,71,A  few people said the food wasnt good.  i enjoy their  beef enchiladas  and nachos.   everyones taste is different i guess.
La Palapa,72,I go there every few weeks on Saturday for lunch when it is not really busy. Chips and salsa on the table. The salsa is a little on the hot side. The service is gracious and the food is Tex-Mex comfort food.   It is quirky their combination plates start at no. 14 and there are no items 1-13. I have had different things from their menu and was never disappointed. Beans and rice and Jesus Christ.  Adelante    I understand it is a venue for live music at night but I have never been at night.
La Palapa,73,Their effort is appreciated  but ever since I came here with a boyfriend .. A lady was the worst server to begin with. She only offered my boyfriend the meal request leaving me clueless as to why she is even a waitress   Other than that shenanigans  their margaritas are good. The third time I came here though...my boyfriend ordered a enchilada plate  amp  I had ordered the crispy taco special...the plate was alright but to my surprise my boyfriend found a piece of broken blade from according to the manager it was a tomato slicer     Wtf  in his enchiladas       Wtf     What got me more mad was that he was totally ok with it    Lol ..ugh  in conclusion...NEVER AGAIN.
La Palapa,74,Service was chill. Food was dank. Margs were bomb. Good spot with great sized portions.
La Palapa,75,Food is good  but slowest service in town.  Have been here over an hour and half.  Waiting for our food.
La Palapa,76,To draught or not to draft. My server offered me glass sizes and not beer selections when asked  what do you have on draught   After explaining the situation to him  I was told  I don t work in the bar  but I can get you a drink menu . Turns out they had schwagweisser lite  schwagiller light  and Dos Equis. Three beers   too hard to memorize.   So I ordered a pint of Dos Equis. Instead I got a schooner  which for only a dollar more gets you two more ounces and a ridiculously unwieldy glass by the way waiter  not a better deal at all . I commented on this when it was brought to the table  the waiter then offered to take it back and not to just adjust the check. As I had waited nearly 15 minutes to get this drink  I was not about to wait another  and just took it.  Shortly after  our food arrived. It was standard cafeteria grade affair  most likely from bags and buckets labeled Sysco and probably rejected by the high school situated directly behind the cantina. The  salsa  tasted like canned spaghetti sauce with a can of Rotel in it  the queso was about on par of the stuff that squezes from the canister at 7-11.  Afterward  the check was delivered and none of the pricing matched what was on their happy hour menu. I sent this back and had to wait for the manager who was hard at work checking out the outgoing end of female patrons rather than helping his staff.  The environment was no better. The staff was constantly coming in and out of the bar area which was loudly playing music that was not the same as what was in the restaurant proper.This was quite distracting and made it very difficult to hear the others I was having dinner with.  Overall this place is just sub-par. I would not waste my money here again. 3 beers and a half price appetizer platter should not be over 20 .
La Palapa,77,I just ordered 1 2 order or fajitas nachos and a coke and it cost me more than a full order of nachos. My bill was 15 dollars and some change. The nachos were so tough I had to eat just the toppings but did not want to complain.  I about flipped a lid. I paid my bill and left a note about my visit. Very unhappy guest 
La Palapa,78,Went there the other day with hubby and kids. Not at all pleased with the food.. and VERY disappointed with the service. I had to call the waitress over 4 times...had I never called her over  she never would have came. Waited and waited and waited.. then call her again. Ridiculous  especially being there were ONLY 3 tables being dined there  That s right  you heard me. 8 people aside from my table. They were sitting at 3 other tables. Uncalled for.  When I pulled in the parking lot  I asked my husband  Are they open   lol... should have told me something. But we were hungry  kids were fussy... it was time to eat.   I will NEVER do it again. Luckily between the 4 of us  we only spent  25  so that was a plus. But the food was not appealing at all. And  while I would not typically complain the food arrived too quickly  I will now. It arrived within 5 minutes of ordering it. When he brought the food out  I was thinking... was already plated  How in the world did it get here so FAST   Absolutely could not believe it. I mean  it takes 20  minutes to get your  pretty good  food at La Morada and on piping hot plates nonetheless    Unfortunately  however  the quality of the food was equal to  I d say Taco Bell Cabana.   For starters  the corn chips were too thick and not crispy enough. We didnt even finish a basket  which isnt normal . The salsa... we the first bowl brought out was mild  my kids enjoyed it... when I asked for more to go on my chimmichanga  it was so ridiculously spicy  I could not eat it. Talk about being inconsistent.   The queso tasted like melted velveeta.... disgusting. Thick and gooey  no authentic flavor at all. The chicken in my Chimmichanga COULD have been the highlight  except  it was too dry    The serving size of beans and rice were questionable  knowing every other Mexican Restaurant covers the plate with the them.    Overall a terrible  will not go again  experience.
La Palapa,79,I feel confused. My fault though. I came in with great anticipation. I have been seeing this place and heard about this place for years. It stood the test of time. It had to be great.   so....  hmmmmm....  I got there  no one was inside  customers i mean  oh well. Staff was nice polite but i think the person that waited us was new. so forgiven. chips salsa good. Margaritas bang. Menu had Vegetarian selection  so points bam  I got spinach quesadilla  to much spinach not enough cheese. i bet Skip used all the cheese on his freakin  kay sa dila. Service was polite.  So......  Nothing that really made me go  AWESOME POSSUM    I felt like i did when i lost my virginity  thinking   thats it    blah. ok the score we start at five stars. minus one because it just was not Big Bang enough. chips and salsa good so keep star. margarita good so keep star. food  ok  but nothing spectacular so minus one. that gives this place three stars. service ok so keep star. they had a veggie menu. so plus one. so i give it four.   its a weird joint but it stood for years. so cant argue.
La Palapa,80,Not far from office. Ordered from lunch menu. Fajitas is around  12. I really like fajitas  but probably it s too much for lunch. So I ordered fajitas tacos. Two tacos are around  10.  It s tasty  but they missed sour cream. And you can order same fajitas tacos from Taco Cabana for half price. So it s not that special. Starting from tomorrow  this part of 290  between 183 and 130 will become a toll road. So I m not driving on this road anymore.
La Palapa,81,This place was okay.  It was nothing to rave about.  We went to this place for a work happy hour and dinner.  One big draw that pulled us there was that they supposedly had free food during happy hour.  But when I saw it  it wasn t exactly as it was portrayed.  It was more like a tray of nachos under a hot lamp and you could go dish it up as you pleased.  I passed.  Instead  for dinner I ordered a Corona light  thumbs up for having Corona light  and the chalupa plate.  Although  when it came out  it looked more like a tostada than a chalupa.  Whatever.  It was still good.  One annoying thing I found was that they charged different prices for my beer at the bar  than they did when I ordered from my server.  It was more expensive at the bar.  Annoying.  We went on a Thursday night  so they had  The Newz  playing.  They were alright.  They took al our requests.  Although  if we weren t there  I wonder who they would have been play to since we were the only people in the cantina.  The restaurant seemed oddly slow.  Bottom Line   I won t suggest that we go back there  but if I end up there again out of happenstance  it ll be okay.
La Palapa,82,La Palapa translates as  The Palm.  Although we don t have a Palm in ATX  I ll bet other reviewers have been to The Palm in Houston. It will really make you laugh if you compare  La Palapa  with  The Palm.   Most of the good reviews for this restaurant seem to focus on their margaritas. Although that s a component of a good restaurant  I really don t think that s a good indicator of how good their food is. Personally  I look at restaurant reviews for information about the food.  I can t comment at all on the drinks other than to say their iced tea tastes like iced tea. I can however comment on the food. IT S TERRIBLE   If you stop to consider the number of really good tex-mex places within 2 miles of this place  it s hard to figure out how La Palapa stays open.  Ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you I am a true tex-mex aficionado. You will notice several of my reviews are from various Austin tex-mex eateries. This place is the worst excuse for a tex-mex restaurant I ve seen in Austin. I ordered a combo plate so I could try a little bit of everything. I also ordered a small chili con queso so I could try that too. Here s the breakdown   Crispy taco - Shell was wet and limp. Meat not seasoned. Very bland. Cheese Enchilada - Could not find one bit of cheese in the rolled-up tortilla. Sauce had way too much cumin which overpowered any other flavor. Taco al Carbon - What a joke  The same crappy meat  beef  they use in their fajitas. It was tough  dry and tasted like it had been marinated in coffee. It had a really weird  not good  flavor. Queso - honestly tasted like it came right out of the can of nacho cheese left over from a football game....AWFUL  Chips  amp  Salsa - Unlike other reviews  I found this to be the only marginally enjoyable part of the meal  although that s not saying very much. The salsa was somewhat tasty and it s fresh  but it s very  very mild. Chips were chips.  My combo plate  small queso and iced tea came to almost  17. That s an insanely high-priced tex-mex meal for anywhere in Austin  especially for a place located on 290 right next to Reagan High. Not exactly the highest-rent area in town.  The decor in the place is cheap and not well-maintained. You can tell this restaurant used to be a fast-food place. There s even remnants of the drive-through.  The only positive thing I can say about La Palapa is about the service. Friendly waitress was fairly attentive. Since it appears everyone who works at La Palapa is Hispanic  I wonder how they feel about serving such bland  low-quality food.    This is the worst dining experience I ve had since Burger-Tex on Airport. Blvd. Avoid both La Palapa and the Airport Burger-Tex at all costs.
La Palapa,83,No reason to stay open after 10 if the kitchen isn t open.  Only the bar was open and we didn t go for the bar we were looking for some good tacos  etc.       
La Palapa,84,Pretty standard Tex Mex food. Some of it is a little bland. I ve never really been wow-ed by anything I ve eaten there. The food is a little pricey for what you get  I think. But they also have specials.  Like buy one get one free enchiladas on Tuesdays. I m not sure about this. Check their Web site.  And the drinks aren t priced too badly. The margaritas are on the strong side.   A plus side is that the restaurant is open later than many  because of the adjoining cantina. I ve eaten lunch in the cantina side but can t imagine going there at night-- they always seem to be blasting bad music. Even when eating at the restaurant at night  I cringe every time the door between the two sections opens.
La Palapa,85,Went here for happy hour after work with fellow coworkers.  Someone else chose this place since it s less than 2 minutes from work.  Worse decision EVER.  I ordered their house frozen margarita...it was just okay with very little tequila.  Chips and salsa were okay.  Queso was so watered down and runny that it didn t have much flavor.  Everything was lackluster.  Coworker next to me ordered nachos...apparently with a side of gnats   Not the inevitable little fruit fly gnats but big healthy gnats that look like they ve been feasting for awhile   They just kept landing on her food.  After several attempts to swat them away  the gnats were like   B tch  this is MY food    Did I order anything else   Hell to the NO   Blah     Everything felt dirty.  The restaurant is dark and dirty. Oh  one more thing  the men s restroom had a handwritten sign on it that says  Out of Order - Use the restroom on the side ...so WHY didn t they lock it or something   We kept seeing other customers still using it   SOOO GROOOOSE   
La Palapa,86,This is definitely not the best mex food in town but it s passable. The carne guisada is great and the fajitas and tacos al carbon are good.  Margaritas are huge although the last time we went they were neon-green which was a turn off.   Service is good and they have a huge buffet around brunch-time on the weekends.  From below   Starting from tomorrow  this part of 290  between 183 and 130 will become a toll road. So I m not driving on this road anymore.  Uh  no.  This is in our  hood which is the main reason we frequent it. And to the person below who said it wasn t in a good neighborhood. . .just stick to Trudy s.
La Palapa,87,I have eaten a few things on the menu  and all of them are pretty good.  I mean  this isn t gourmet Tex-Mex.  It s beans and cheese and guacamole and salsa and tortilla and all that Tex-Mex entails. It s a restaurant on the side of a highway.  Don t expect an  Iron Chef  to bring out some flaming  dry ice sort of enchilada with rare Columbia Robin eggs in it  I have no idea if those exist  but you get what I am saying .  It s way better than a regular Taqueria  which I also love .  So  I say try it.  Good things   The salsa passes the test.  It is good and spicy  but not  I don t want to sit on the toilet ever again  spicy.  It s freaking good.  The drinks are huge.  Well  the non alcoholic drinks.  They are gigantic Big Gulp sized drinks.  So  for your Coke and tea needs  go here.  The food is good.  I like it.  They pass my beans and rice test  which even some fancier places aren t able to do that .  The chili relleno is scrumtrulescent.  I am trying to eat my way across the city in chili rellenos.  This one is good.  But  really  most everything I have tried is yummy.  The portions are huge.  I am a fat person and not one with a thyroid problem.  It s an  I eat too damn much and sit on the couch  kind of a problem.  I have never been able to finish a plate of food here.  I ve tried   I have   Can t do it.  The portions are enormous.  Way enough for snacking later and possibly lunch the next day.  So  take it from Fatty Boom Balatty.  It s a lot of food.  The Bad   It s kinda pricey for what it is.  Now  that being said  they give you 11lbs of burrito.  So  I probably should say that it is the mediocre.  However  almost everything is over 10 bucks.  So  take that for what it s worth.  The place is a bit grungy  but that just means when I drop beans down my shirt  no one looks at me funny.  I don t mind it so much.  I think it gives it character.  Besides  as I stated before  it is a restaurant on the side of a highway.  The sorta baddish   The service is hit or miss.  They can either be all up on you or never come near you.  That doesn t bother me much.  Some days I don t really want to be at work  either  and it shows.  And  if you work on your feet all day  every day  you are fine by me if you go and sit down.  But  I m easy about that  please see fatty note .  In shape and spry people might not like it so much.  They are always nice  though     I will keep going back.  I like it.  Sure  it s not for everyone.  But  I like things like crappy reality TV and the Food Network and Yacht Rock and crap like that.  So  if you are really cool person who like super cool things  then you may not like La Palapa.  Oh  and you can t miss with a huge ass tacky nonworking fountain in the middle of a restaurant.  I mean  come on   And just say the name.  It s super fun to say.  La Palapa   La Palapa   La Palapa   See  super fun 
La Palapa,88,I love this place   Everything I ve ever gotten here has been delicious  Really good queso and guacamole. The chicken enchiladas with sour cream sauce are AMAZING     The shredded chicken is moist and cooked to perfection and the sour cream sauce is thick and super creamy  unlike some other restaurants where it is soupy and tastes watered down  I m talking to you Tres Amigos   The staff is always friendly and pleasant and the service is usually very fast. If you re wanting a delicious  affordable meal in a low-key relaxing atmosphere  La Palapa is the way to go 
La Palapa,89,La Palapa is good Tex-Mex food compared to a lot of locations in Austin for this menu price is medium most can afford. And waitresses are attentive. Ola flor.
La Palapa,90,Tasty  quick Tex-Mex. I ate there today for lunch. Combos are not too expensive and the atmosphere reminds me of West Texas Mexican eateries.  Don t make a trip across town  but if you re in the area and need a quick bite stop by.
La Palapa,91,Another solid Tex-Mex restaurant in the neighborhood. Good margaritas and Mexican martinis. Salsa is good  but could be hotter. Enchilada platter and the flautas are my favorite items here. Service can be hit or miss...sometimes friendly  sometimes not. Bonus points for karaoke nights...hilarious   
La Palapa,92,Aww  man...under new ownership.  Now the bar is so LOUD you can t hold a decent conversation with the person sitting next to you.  Also  the bar counter is now brightly lit so that it s lost it s appeal.
La Palapa,93,It was the worst service I ve ever encountered. My boyfriend and I went in for Kareoke. The kj immediately informed us that they don t go in order so it would be a while. The waitress in the kareoke section didn t even acknowledge the fact that we were there. We stood up to go to the restaurant since we didn t get service. We ordered two drinks.... The waitress came back and said sorry the kitchen is closed. We spent 20 minutes on there before anyone even came up to us all too be told there was no more service. I do not recommend. If you go be prepared to be disappointed.
La Palapa,94,I work just down the street from this place and have driven by it many times  so I figured I d take a break from my regular lunch spots and give it a try.  The lunch menu had good variety but everything was in the  8 to  10 range.  Not too bad  but not really in line with the selection at some of the other places in the area.  Still  this looks like a nicer mexican joint  so I figured the food would justify the price.  Not the case.  My chile relleno was ok  but the chicken was cold and obviously reheated.  The rice was just ok.  The tortillas were definately not fresh  basic store bought tortillas that were reheated.  For an  8 lunch  I don t expect gormet  but this was seriously not worth the money.  My friend ordered beef soft tacos and was extremely dissapointed.  His tacos were a crappy reheated corn tortilla and beef.  No cheese or anything else on them.  Two very plain tacos.    I give them 2 stars simply because the portion size was good and the food was ok in flavor  despite my chicken being cold.  Considering the area of town this place is in  there are far superior places to eat for less money.
La Palapa,95,I have been going to La Palapa for a very long time.  The chips and salsa are very good. The shredded chicken enchiladas are packed with lots o  moist shredded chicken.  The bean and cheese nachos with jalapenos are some of the best in town.  The service is usually good.  Plenty of parking.  Reliable Tex-Mex at reasonable prices.  The happy hour margaritas seem to be made with cheap mix instead of fresh lime juice.  Bogus.
La Palapa,96,If you want to get a little closer to interior Mexico type food...try this place   The restaurant is in the round building and a bar area is attached on one side.    Great queso  fresh made chips  tacos that are never greasy  tamales A-ok    .    I ve never been to the bar area  but on Friday and Sat nights  it is always hopping.  I think they also offer karaoke.  Check out their new website for more details    a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fwww.lapalapaaustin.com amp s 3d38f09bd11c03b727cc2d0d2cdd9c0d29ebda29fe36bdb632f2f863ba4bd851  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  lapalapaaustin.com  a 
La Palapa,97,I visited the cantina next to the restaurant at the tail end of a happy hour with some friends  and all I had time to do was notice that the chips were fried in insipid oil  and the waitress seemed to be helping out of obligation  not a genuine desire to help.
La Palapa,98,Before I write this review let me say this. I have gone there many times in the past and been satisfied. Delicious food in the past.....so with that said.... Feeling under the weather I was craving Caldo  Mexican soup  so I thought well this is a Mexican restaurant let me try there.  The menu listed Beef Caldo and Tortilla Soup. OK well I was wanting chicken and the menu listed shredded chicken in the tortilla soup. When it was delivered I was immediately turned off by the dark broth. Most tortilla soups I have eaten have a clear chicken  broth. First thing I noticed was there was no chicken  Only vegies. I called the waiter and he informed me it doesn t have chicken. I told him to read the menu and yes he agreed it said shredded chicken. I told him to take it back and bring me the beef caldo. Upon his return he told me the chef said it was out of season. Out of season  Really  Beef caldo consisting of vegies and beef was out of season  Well at that point I was starving so I told him just bring me 2 soft tacos. The bill for 2 soft tacos and coffee....  note no rice or beans on the side  was  8.39. Any other place at that price would have gotten me an entr e plus sides. Tip  next time go to Amaya s 
La Palapa,99,I would give this place 0 stars if possible. My husband went to pick up food for us one evening  and was horrified at what he witnessed. Apparently there was a man passed out drunk in front of the door to the cantina area. My husband tried to see if he was ok  he was clearly just passed out drunk. My husband told the bartender and a waiter about the man. He waited for our food  and after a few minutes walked to the car. That same man was now passed out again and laying halfway out of his truck which was running. My husband went inside and spoke to someone who once again assured him they would do something. My husband told them  if you don t take his keys away right now I m going to call the police . My husband was in disbelief that a restaurant could be so irresponsible. To allow clearly intoxicated people drive off and potentially harm someone just blows my mind. They should have their liquor license removed. As for the food  it s just ok  and the restaurant smells like mildew. I refuse to support any business that clearly doesn t care about the publics safety  so needless to say we never returned.
La Palapa,100,I ate here the other day for lunch  I was looking for another Mexican restaurant  but didn t find it .   I was pleasantly surprised by the decor and food. I ordered pollo poblano and it was very good. The chicken was just a bit tough  but nowhere close to being inedible. The Spanish rice  guacamole  and pico were good too. The complimentary chips are solid and well-made. the accompanying salsa was just a bit on the hot side  but delicious 
La Palapa,101,I haven t ever been to the store  but I have had take out.   Edit - because I have been there now   As Eric Cartman says... basically if a business has a fountain  it s a successful one. This place has a small fountain in the middle of the place. Actually it s kinda strange  but it s alright.   I got some Enchiladas while going there and it was good as expected. There were a couple of bones in the meat  chicken . I was at first  why   then I realized that at least I know the meat is fresh. Good.  The proportions are nice and massive. Are you hungry and want lotsa food  grab some Lapalapalapalapalapas. It s plenty of fun saying that way.   I had some enchiladas and my co workers had various other things. mmmmm so good. Very tex-mex. Very good. I wish I had more to say because it s been a while since I ve had the food  but once I go there or get some take out again  I ll update.
La Palapa,102,I would recommend Lapalapa Salad. Its the best ever  days start with freash salad yum
La Palapa,103,Longest wait to order our food and recieve our drinks I ve ever had at an establishment. Prices on menu are not accurate. And also the Happy Hour price are bogus. They will come up with excuses and try to find a way to make u pay full price if not more. Besides all that  to top it off I received food from UNDER A HEAT LAMP. This place sucks. They are obviously trying to screw people over because the waiter mentioned they had financial issues. Never again.
La Palapa,104,I went here for dinner during the Formula 1 Grand Prix. The service was speedy and pleasant and the food was good. this is not a fancy-pants place. If you are looking for good Tex-Mex at reasonable prices  this is a good option.
La Palapa,105,A perfectly fried chili relleno can be found here. Yummy and saturated with that fryin  oil.   This place is A-OK. I ll usually get enchiladas without cheese and other funky substitutions for lunch and they oblige and it s good.   But because I always associate this place with a work lunch and it has a really bad location I ll never go there for a feel good weekend experience.
La Palapa,106,I quickly went in for lunch. Nice place  one of the restaurants that has been in Austin for a very long time. Food is very generous and very relaxing. There were a lot of local to go there very often. You can tell.
La Palapa,107,The food was was good and the environment was welcoming. We sat in the diner area of the restaurant. They have a karaoke bar which is always on and popping on Friday s.. Now as for the service it really sucked.took to long for drinks and food.
La Palapa,108,This place is Great for family and friends  enjoy the positive vibration and Karaoke Friday and Saturday night. Its a One of a Kind place  I LOVE THIS PLACE 
La Palapa,109,I would say if you are interested in great salsa and a few drinks this is a good spot. They do not have wonderful food but it is not bad either  the salsa is banging though. Service was good  and pretty quick for the most part.
La Palapa,110,I really just had a hankering for a relleno that could not be stopped. I could not believe I didn t know about this gem in my own neighborhood   I ll pay tomorrow  but the jalapeno poppers were the second-best in the city  they upset my stomach but I go there anyway . Opal Devine s still wins  due to the cheddar cheese quality. They were well-battered and just YUM  I liked this batter far better  if it were sharper cheese  it d win.  The atmosphere reminded me of Jovita s in the south  but I live north  not as kitsch and uh  CAN I PLEASE STEAL THAT CHANDELIER  A cozy place.  My service was exactly what I want  not too little  not too much. I personally hate it whenever a waiter waitress is desperately in your face   Do you need anything     and interrupting a conversation. Again  just cozy.  The vegetarian relleno--the whole reason I went--was actually also the second-best in the city I ve had. First still goes to Guerro s  only available on Wednesday as the special  last I checked.  I was completely happy with my experience  given the price  location  food  service  atmosphere  all of it.
La Palapa,111,Very friendly staff with average Mexican food. They do have a lot of options  ranging from the Tex-Mex classics to healthier fare including grilled tilapia with saut ed vegetables. Lunch is fast and cheap and usually has an interesting special on tap. Everything I ve tried has been ok  but not spectacular. I ve never had drinks at the bar  but they have a combination breathalyzer selfie machine that makes me think they serve up a few cervezas.
La Palapa,112,Great food and great service last several times I have visited.  Also wait staff was very friendly and very patient  especially with my friend.  Lol   .  Would strongly recommend.
La Palapa,113,This place used to be the place id go with the girls have a few drinks and have a good time before we go downtown. Not anymore not ever again  Service-down right horrible and slow. our waiter could not remeber our orders and had to come back 3 times to ask us again. Food sucks quality as gone downhill and not worth the price. it s dirty the tables were sticky and gross.
La Palapa,114,Good  cheap special and quick service for lunch. A tiny gem in an area with not much else wise
La Palapa,115,I went there this past Thurs. The host and server were courteous. We got there at around 9 pm. the enchiladas I ordered were pretty good  but the rice was bland and the beans needed a bit for taste. I ordered to drink the Bloody Mary  it was pretty spicy and good.  My friend ordered the Tex Mex nachos  which comes with ground meat and rice and refried beans. Well it didn t have enough cheese  they seemed dry to me  instead of ground beef they gave him little bits of beef fajita the size of bacon bits.  They didn t give him rice nor beans. I ended up giving him my bland rice and tasteless beans.  The server really never came around after serving us so that we could tell him. His drink was the same as mine.
La Palapa,116,So this place was fun for karaoke. BUTT we were there for hours and were literally never served and were the only white people there. I m not being anything but true Literally we were the only table in the karaoke bar not served. Would not go here again and the only reason I m givjng this two stars is because our wives had fun singing. We were there January 11th 2014. From 8 till actually now. Lol
La Palapa,117,Horrible food  drunk men everywhere  you can tell they pay attention  to their regulars rather than new customers like I  terrible service.
La Palapa,118,Today  we were debating if we should hit Mexican or Whataburger. We were on our way to a meeting and they were both conveniently on the way. We decided to go with Mexican  until next time my WB friends  and hit up La Palapa - that hut looking restaurant on the north side of 290. We went for lunch so there was quite the crowd. We sat down and started with the salsa  blah  - too tomatoey  then the chips  ay guay   they had a lardy filmy taste that stuck with ya all day  So I had to move on to the menu. Yikes  8-10 bucks for the lunch plates  I know I tend to be cheap but c mon. Although they did have a lunch special for 6.99 that included 1 taco  1 rice and 1 beans. Still  way too much for my taste.  I ended up ordering the Tacos Al Carbon plate  which was the same as the Fajita Plate except cheaper . I was pretty suspicious of their carne  al carbon  and to no surprise it was fajita  Yet with NO SABOR...por favooor  They didn t come through with the beans either  too salty  and the rice  way too mushy. My co-workers had chicken tacos and crispy beef tacos and they were disappointed as well. All in all  La Palapa was not a very good taco eating experience. I shall grant them juan estar - the water was good.

La Palapa,119,it had a fun atmosphere  the waitress was on point and the taco salad was really good. karaoke was fun.
La Palapa,120,Holy cow  Excellent service and two  not one  delicious plates of food for under  10  Yes  I got the vegetarian combination and two large plates of food arrived. A cheese enchilada  tostada  vegetable taco  side of guacamole  and beans  amp  rice  plus a basket of chips  amp  salsa. And all were super tasty. I ll definitely be back.
La Palapa,121,Salsa isn t what I expected  so i opted out to continue dipping my chips in it. Instead  got queso which wasn t worth a darn either. I ordered 3 shrimp enchiladas with verde sauce  green sauce  and wasn t pleased. The sauce tasted as if there was lime juices blended in it and the inside of the tortilla itself looked to be coated with chilli pepper. By preference  this is not my forte. I usually eat at a smaller  in the hole  type restaraunt so maybe this  Tex-Mex  crap isn t something I find too appetizing. True authentic Mexican food  Yes.   The waitress asked us after several obvious desires of a good tip  if we wanted anything from the cantina. As it being my first time there  i said sure. I ordered a simple sweet and sour cherry vodka that ended up being so strong  i could hardly down it. My girlfriend had 2 of the same drink. When i mentioned the drink to the waitress  she replied  Yeah well you definitely get your money s worth   i disagreed. I rather spend more if it means it will be a drink I can enjoy. Not barely consume. I m sorry  but i don t buy alcohol to get wasted or poisoned like the other idiots in this world.  Not going back to this place. Rediculously priced for the quality of food this place serves.
La Palapa,122,My fiance and I just wasted 32.00 bucks tonight on the WORST dining experience we ve had to date.  Seriously  with all the great Mexican places around town  please save your money and go elsewhere.  I mean  Taco Bell is just down the street.  Yeah... Taco Bell.  It totaly came to that.    We walk in to the place at about 8ish tonight and find that  the place is divided into two parts.  One side of this round edifice is a bar that s a bit reminiscent of a hole I once visited in Laredo.  If aggressively drunk   greasy douche bags and blaring pop music within a dimly lit crescent shaped room are your style  then by all means bask in it s electric blue glow.  Unfortunately  after a long day of work  we opted for the quiet  restaurant portion of the place.    After our hostess escorts us to our table  a waitress takes our drink order and then the experience just all goes downhill from there.   Service was incredibly slow.  INEXCUSABLY slow considering the fact that there were only THREE parties in the entire place including us.  I scored a free queso coupon off their site  so we started out with that and some salsa.  The salsa had a ketchup like consistency and smelled of sweaty  gym socks.  The queso was decent  but a way too buttery and peppered with pinkie- nail sized chunks of canned bell peppers and tomatos.  Rotel and Velveeta anyone   Both of us order tilapia dishes because some of the Yelpers recommended it.  But we were very displeased by the results.   My fiance s tilapia dish was sunken like buried treasure  which had drowned completely in a sea of frothy cream sauce AND queso.  The goopy-ness completely masked the taste of the fish.  My tilapia felt awfully oily for something that was described as  grilled.   The accompanying sides were incongreuent to the rest of the dish.  Charro beans  sauteed squash and zuchhini  lettuce  tomatoes and cheese   Huh   These dishes had serious identity crises issues.  We didn t even touch the cold  hard tortillas.  The edges were terribly stiff and stale.  Just inherently wrong all around   But the SHADY thing is that when we presented the coupon to the waitress for that free queso.... Once we got our ticket back she failed to take it off.  No biggie  but immediately after she dropped off our ticket  the waitress made a bee line to the bar area and started to hang out and joke with the patrons.  My fiance and I wait...and wait...and WAIT for her to come back.  After a good ten minutes  my fiance finaly gets out of his seat and approaches her in the back bar area.  After saying  excuse me   to get the waitress s attention  the obviously drunk bar patrons start to mock him for disturbing the waitress when she was supposed to be working.  How dare he    gasp   After my my fiance ignores the drunk douchebags and lets her know that the ticket was totaled up incorrectly  she acts completely clueless of her mistake.  Fine.  But then we wait..and wait..and wait again.  We see a serious yet hushed discussion take place between the manager and the waitress off to the side by the register.  Finaly the manager comes up to our table and asks if he can just give us cash back for the queso.  Yet he goes on and starts to rattle on and on about some inane story concerning some disgruntled customer and how much of a hassle it was to comp people.   Dude  seriously  I ve spent way too much time here.  I just wanted this guy to give us our discount -but he was acting as if he didn t want to give it to us by complaining about this pain-in-the-ass customer.  It was just SUPER shady all around.      All I gotta say is  I ve never walked out of a restaurant and never tipped a waitress.   I ve never walked into a restaurant and been treated as though my patronage was such a burden to their already crappy establishment.  This place gets one star however  for it s structure.  It s open air setup would make a great place for hosting a small event.  The owners should most certainly call it quits and just sell their place to some proprietor who can turn it into a place that s WORTHY of visiting.
La Palapa,123,I m a huge UT fan  so after a short training session at work on Saturday  when my boss suggested we all go out to eat close to the office  her treat  my first question was   Can we go where they have a tv   I wanted to hang out with my coworkers  but also keep tabs on the Texas-Baylor game. She called ahead to make sure La Falapa had a tv. Indeed they do   Yippee  let s go   As we walk into La Falapa  I notice that it s empty. Okay  well everyone must be in the cantina watching the game. We walk into the cantina. Crickets. Nobody.  But there s a huge tv  so let s watch the game    Game s not on. Okay  have them change the channel. I m still excited because I m thinking we have discovered the one place on gameday not crowded with Longhorn fans.  There were a few in burnt orange so we assumed the game would be on. Maybe we were just too early and none of the workers really cared about the game. But they ll put it on now that the fans are arriving.  Did I mention the overpowering bleach smell   We sit down  with a perfect view of the tv. Still no game. The guy at the bar is now feverishly changing the channel from HSN  to ESPN to CNN  trying to find it. Nada.  A nice man brings chips and salsa. Salsa was actually pretty good and the chips were a bit salty  but tasty.   We order drinks. Dos X  chips and salsa. Now I just need the game.  The couple in Longhorn gear sits at a table behind us. We re all obviously waiting for the dude at the bar to put the tv on the right channel.  At this point  everyone s speculating that they don t have the right cable access.   Seriously  Seriously.  Oh well  at least I noticed that they have shredded beef tacos on the menu. This will make up for not being able to watch the game.   Did I mention the music they put on to  I guess  compensate for no game   Shredded beef tacos   Yay. I can t wait to take a bite out of a crunchy  shredded beef taco with cheese and lettuce topping.   They arrive. Boo    Not shredded. And the meat looks ike it s seen better days. Flour tortillas.  The beans were good and the rice was okay.   The service wasn t so great either. Once they brought our food  they seemed to avoid us until we had to search for someone to bring the bill.  As we re waiting  I notice a sign advertising Karoake night on Fridays and Saturdays that declares   Sing like nobody s watching   and  I think  that sounds about right. Nobody will be watching.  So to sum up  no game  crappy tacos  inconsistent service  but hey  we ve got Celine Dion music playing in the background.   Serenity now  
La Palapa,124,Post happy hour downtown  with some new found friends and a broke bank account...whats a gal to do.  Why Karaoke on the East Side  of course.  Ill admit. I m a tad bit scared of the East Side. Maybe if I went more I would be less scared. But here  driving on 290   the weirdest high way ever  we pull into this little restaurant in the back of an Exxon.  The place is packed. So packed its splitting out the seams  I park in an unofficial parking space on a curb and hope no one will hit my car.  Walk in. Crazy packed. Like I mean so packed you cant even dream of finding a place to sit  and we weren t the only ones.  I look at it as a new experience. My friend buys me a drink  a margarita the size of my head. Everyone is singing loud  get the crowd moving  songs. A bizarrely large of UT students on an initiation dare were there  singing loudly to pop songs. My friends jammed out to Hotel California and some Queen.   I watched.   It was the kind of joint where if you were a guy you had to be loud and sing about drugs or sex. If you were a girl you were a stereotypical belter and got alot of whoop calls from the audience. It the kind of place where I two stepped In a tiny crowded space in the bar and no one cared. Where only half the patrons spoke English and loved it that way. Where  Big Jim  The Karaoke host actually had a rock awesome voice and when he harmonized with the singers he actually helped them rather then hurt them   Ive seen some bad karaoke hosts y all    Everyone knew everyone  the drinks were flowing  the crowd was jumping. Mr. Lapala himself came in  bought a drink at the bar and was greeted by a round of applause by the rowdy fans. Big Jim says  He never thought karaoke would work here  but now after 14000 shows we ve done it   And everyone cheers. And a man walked by and said  Damn Girl  you sure are sexy  to moi. A thing I don t mind hearing every once and a while   the old ego didn t mind a boost last night   An experience.  It did have some downsides  which must be mentioned.  1. Nowhere to sit. At all for like hours. We finally found a table about two hours in. I have a feeling that without the 80 plus UT students it would have a much more intimate feel. 2. Someone had obviously gotten sick at the bar. No  we couldn t see it  but we sure could smell it. I think we were the only ones that minded though.  The staff worked hard and Big Jim rocked out  and although this isn t a place that I would frequent really   I think I m a more of a common interest karaoker   I m glad I went. You east side  Stop in and have a 5lb margarita  and sing a jam  baby 
La Palapa,125,Average at best. The food was nothing impressive. My father picked this place based on an article he read rating it as one of the top 10 restaurants in Austin...which I find very hard to believe. It wasn t the worst Mexican food ive ever had but I also certainly won t be a repeat customer.
La Palapa,126,Ate there for lunch today. Cheese Enchilada Verde was awesome  The salsa and chips are great  Service was really good.
La Palapa,127,Is it just me or does this place look like it needs a big ol scrubdown  I have a hard time enjoying a place that just looks plain dirty. Some places I feel are meant to look a bit  rustic  but this place just looked funky. My food was edible  but I couldn t see myself rushing over there for anything...ever. Parking is nuts. On the plus side  the food came out fast and service was great.
La Palapa,128,This is one of our two go-to Mexican places in our neighborhood.  There is a crazy rocking bar on one side  and a perfectly lovely little nondescript neighborhood restaurant on the other.  The food is basic mexican.  Good talapia dishes.  Yummy fajitas.  I love their enchiladas - especially their mushroom and poblano enchiladas.  I usually ask for some kind of adjustment on my meal - trading rice for sauteed veggies  combining the mushroom-spinach enchiladas with the mushroom-poblano enchiladas so that I get amazing mushroom-spinach-poblano enchiladas - annoying alterations like that - and they ALWAYS get my meal right.   Great for families  they have a lovely kids menu with lots of Mexican favorites.  The service is so friendly and sweet.  And the drinks are fantastic  too    But do NOT get the Sangria - it s that disgusting  sangria flavored  wine.  So. Very. Gross.  Their salsa is some of my very favorite in town.  Very fresh.  Nice balance  it has a kick but doesn t hurt.  Small dice raw onions give it the perfect tooth.
La Palapa,129,This is a good place to eat and meet with friends for some really good fishbowl sized margaritas.  The portions are huge and on the weekend nights they have a very good buffet  it is a little pricey.  After your meal you have to go to the Cantina and chug a few more margaritas to sing karaoke.  All in all a good solid place to keep on your short list of Mexican restaurants.
La Palapa,130,Susie  too bad you didn t try the food in the restaurant. I think it is the best Mex food in Austin. I live near La Palapa and eat there often. The saloon and the restaurant are separate. You only have to hear the karaoke when nachos leave the kitchen and head to the bar and the door separating the dining room and saloon opens.  The dining room is round  roughly  and the ceiling is tastefully papered with grass mats. I guess that s the palapa. Looks like it might have been a Polynesian restaurant in a previous life.     On a Friday night when people are committing Karaoke and the parking lot is full  you might have to park on the street or even on the grass. But there will most likely be plenty of tables in the dining room.  Anyway  the food really is good  I think the best Mexican food you can get in Austin. I m vegetarian. They have a nice vegetarian selection. Much better food than Serranos  which is the other Mexican place that put some actual thought into their vegetarian menu. The burrito is great -- the grilled veggies have a super flavor. My carnivore  friend likes their chicken dishes best  and the tortilla soup.  Service is generally good  and always friendly. The salsa is on the hot side and makes a good first impression.   Go try it out and write a review on the food 
La Palapa,131,i nearly rolled out of the restaurant. okay...i ve never had texmex before  so i was expecting a little more. hey  it looks like mexican food....but eaten in texas...is that why they call it texmex   in any case  i was incredibly impressed with the ambiance and service of the place. super nice people  nice floor mat ceilings  and awesome mexican  okay fine....texmex   food. it was recommended by a coworker  and im really glad he recommended it   if you re there for lunch time  be sure to order from the Lunch Menu. it s basically anything you can find on the regular menu  just a little less expensive.
La Palapa,132,I ve never had the urge to post a review about any restaurant before  but this one seemed necessary. I hope this isn t too critical  but that restaurant has so much potential.   On first impression  the restaurant looked awesome. The exterior looks inviting  with that hole in the wall vibe that one would want to keep secret. Signs are posted outside about karaoke nights and cheap happy hours.  From the second I walked in with my girlfriend  we were lost. There was no greeting or sign that we should seat myself or wait for a host. I actually had to question one of the bartenders who hadn t even noticed me if we should seat ourselves. but the atmosphere inside was enough  Our waiter was a nice guy  but I m not sure if he was inexperienced  young  or just not very good. I ordered the migas and fajitas  my girlfriend had tomatillo chicken enchiladas  and we shared a Mexican martini. He came back to ask whether I wanted chicken or beef for my fajitas  then again to ask if I wanted corn or flour tortillas  and then a third time to bring the complimentary chips and salsa that he had forgotten. Then  we receive our food  and I had to ask him about the Mexican margarita and the rice  he had forgotten both.   The food came out quick and hot  and actually wasn t too bad. The beef fajitas were good  but the migas and rice were plain and average. The chicken in the enchiladas looked undercooked  and were slightly pink on some parts. My girlfriend found bones in the chicken enchiladas too. We quickly lost our appetites.   To top it off  there was multiple people not in uniform constantly walking in and out of the kitchen  and the fruit flies we noticed were enough to make me not ever go back.  I feel like this place has so much potential  but there s just an extremely huge lack of management.
La Palapa,133,So  my tire decided to destroy itself right near here.  I called AAA but needed to get out of the heat.  I went to La Palapa  and had some nachos and some very strong margaritas   1 star for the margaritas .  Again  I can t say enough good things about their staff.  They welcomed us in  fed us  gave us the address for the tow truck driver  and basically treated us like family.
La Palapa,134,I sat at the bar  as I usually do when I m alone.  It was quiet. In fact  I was the only customer at the bar. Sigh. It smelled a bit moldy. I ll take that over the stale alcohol smell. I looked around a lot and when I saw Fanta Orange in the bottle  I just knew this was my kinda joint. Yep  I had one   I ordered the Camerones a la Diablo. Shrimp stuffed with jalepeno s and cheese and wrapped in bacon  served atop a rice and cheese casserole with frijoles and guac on the side.  Freaking delicious   The casserole was the perfect chaser for the spicy shrimp   I really liked the dish and I loved the corn tortilla chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and you could really taste the flavor of the corn.  The down side was that I was the only person at the bar  boring  _sigh  and the service was sooooo saalooooow   They were friendly  but my water kept running out and sometimes I wouldn t get any action for like 10 minutes   They should work on that   I will be back  and I will sit at the moldy smelly bar  and I will try a drink  maybe get a shot  hmmmmmm  maybe the blowjob  .  Hopefully there will be other patrons at the bar with me and we can all do a bj shot 
La Palapa,135,When I lived in Austin  this was one of my favorites.  It s been a while since I ve been here  but the food is awesome at La Palapa.  I brought a friend from Jersey here once and he was speechless when he left-probably because he had so many margaritas  but he went back to the east coast raving bout it.  I always try to make sure I get to squeeze in a trip to La Palapa when I m in Austin.  And by the way  there is something about their Dr. Pepper that is way better than any other restaurant s...
La Palapa,136,Food is descent and I think the appetizers are cheap if you get there before 7.  The margaritas are good and the karaoke is fun if you are with a group.  Went for a friend s birthday and had a good time.  Don t drive here though if you plan on drinking.  Take a cab  as you won t want to leave here after drinks and you probably don t want to leave your car here either.
La Palapa,137,A nostalgic place for me.  The food is good but since I live in Pflugerville it isn t the caliber for me to make too many special trip to eat here.
La Palapa,138,So here s the deal....  La Palapa is ok for HH with fellow employees in the area.  That s about it  and I don t even do that very often. The food is just not worth how expensive it is.  I ordered a queso that I paid  5 for... it was smaller than the palm of my freakin HAND   Not only that  the queso tastes like it came out of the Tostitos jar of queso on the HEB isle of chips.  this means it s nasty   Their food is no more that just barely mediocre.   It s cool to catch a quick lunch there because it s close  and the veggie fajitas are ok  but it s not a place I would frequent or that I could give a good review to.   The service sucks and the owners must be able to keep thier heads above water with  money made by the bar  as they don t spend money on anything  decor  improvements  getting a better staff  etc. If you re pushed for time at lunch  sure  other than that  I wouldn t recommend this place to anyone.
La Palapa,139,Horrible service. After being ignored for 15 minutes  my party of 4 asked for water and were told by the waitress that she  had too many tables . After finally being waited on for our drinks  which took 15-20 minutes to arrive   we were informed that the kitchen was now closed. Mind you  the entire time we waited  we saw food being delivered so our  waitress  could have informed us that the kitchen was about to close. No apology or anything from the waitress  although a member of the staff did have the kitchen prepare an order for one member of my party for the inconvenience. Regardless  I will not be back. Ever.
La Palapa,140,Very good service and food. I thought this was a pretty authentic place  cuisine-wise. Easy to get in and out of also.
La Palapa,141,We had very slow seating in an empty place to be served cold chips and weird salsa and luke warm soup on a filthy table. We left the food on the table tipped the server and walked out.
La Palapa,142,Food seemed to be enjoyed by all members of party. Though restaurant appeared clean  the women s bathroom stunk bad  of old      It was warm inside  Reservation called in prior was not reserved upon arrival by party  staff unaware of one made  scurried to put tables together final food orders arrived around 1 1 2 hours later  trickled in slowly one plate here  one plate there  one person finished his taco plate way before  hour   other plates slowly arrived  tortilla soup being last  It s like staff was trying to please and accomodate customers all at same time    Staff never came around to check up on the table  they were scurrying here and there   maybe short staffed   Complaints of drinks being weak-watered down  so was returned  although a slice of birthday cake was served to birthday celebrant  along with the staff singing  the plop of icing on the nose area seemed unappreciated  birthday person caught off guard  One bartender inside  Not sure if standard but gratuity was included on each bill  as party members each paid theirs. One positive thing for sure was the tostada chip bowls kept coming and coming 
La Palapa,143,I love La Palapa   They have some of the best margaritas in Austin.   Also  they have a fun karaoke area to.  I highly recommend giving them a try or 2.      They also updated their salsa  it is super spicy now and I love it   If it s too much spice for you they probably have something softer in the back.   you are weak son  
La Palapa,144,Fajita nachos are off the chain.  Service was a lot faster today and the fajita nachos were awesome.  I ate them so fast  I forgot to take a picture.   from sit down to finished meal took about 30 min.  I guess last week was a tough day. We ll give them another look next week and see how consistent they are.
La Palapa,145,Good  no-nonsense Mexican food at a good price. I ve eaten there for decades and it s never let me down. As more and more authentic good-value Mexican restaurants come to town  this place has always held it s ground. Good stuff.
La Palapa,146,I have eaten here for Lunch before... not the BEST Tex-mex but decent... and they have good lunch specials... HOWEVER.... that is NOT why they only get two stars.... My dinner companion and I stopped in for dinner on a Thursday night.... WOW what a mistake  First... two of the waitresses where smoking right outside the door to go in... CLASSY... but the BAR sweet mother of PEARL ... apparently Thurdsay night is Karaoke night... WITH a full mariachi band... DANG can we talk about LOUD.... we decide to soldier though and go in to the main dininng room.... COUGH  COUGH  COUGH  Is the place on fire    Apparently they need to make improvements to the kitchens ventilation system... SOLDIER ON...  Our waiter Jesses was great... very friendly ... he did get one of our orders wrong... but in his defense it was so loud everytime anyone went thought the door to the bar that my ears almost started bleeding from the trumpet wailing away like a banshee... but I digress... Jessie fixed the order straight away and was very apologetic  he did great   ... LUNCH is defiantly the time to come to La Palapa... Dinner... not so much and defiantly NEVER on a Thursday....
La Palapa,147,This place is consistently good and the prices are very reasonable for great food. I have been going here once a week for over a year and the service is very good. I have probably dealt with every server over the course of the time i have been going there  but Reuben is by far the best server here and i always try to request him if he is working. He is effective and efficient and checks back in for water refills and doesn t leave you waiting for the check when your in a hurry  which i almost always am . It s a pleasure to find someone who takes a pleasure in their job  always has a welcome for me  and others  and in simple terms is a good human.
La Palapa,148,I m pretty disappointed  I love going to get appetizers and margaritas  been siting here at the bar for about 25 minutes with no service. Wait  He just asked me if I needed anything. Decided to just get a marg and will be leaving. Was excited about food but got over it waiting around. Lame. Next stop  a real bar.
La Palapa,149,If you are looking for fancy this is not the place for you. The food and service are awesome. The salsa and chips are perfect. All of our food was great. And Reuben our waiter was great.
La Palapa,150,We stopped here and got take out when we landed in Austin. I got the beef enchilada with tomatillo sauce. I loved the tomatillo sauce  it was really spicy. I enjoyed the food a lot. I can t say what the restaurant is like since we didn t stay.
La Palapa,151,Eh. It s not bad  but it s not great either.  The food is kind of expensive for what you re getting and the drinks could be better. We actually went a few months ago and the drinks were really strong  but we went again yesterday and my margarita tasted like water with a hint of lime. We sent the drink back because I m not paying  10 for lime juice but when it came back it was still kinda crappy  a lot more limey with the faintest hint of tequila.  If you go during the day the restaurant is usually pretty empty. With that being said the waitstaff was still really slow.  we asked for napkins and didn t see our waitress for 15 minutes...we also had to wait another 15 minutes for them to let us pay for the meal .  I mean  don t get me wrong  the people that work there are really nice  but I don t know what the hell takes them so long.  There was also a multitude of fruit flies and houseflies  restaurant-flies    hovering around our table so half the time we were on food-blocking our meals.  It s an okay place the could be a lot better.
La Palapa,152,They have made more updates to their happy hour appetizer specials.  The sampler  plate we had last time was no longer on the menu.  We tried the Queso which had pico and ground beef added... it actually didn t taste as good as as it used to.  We also ordered some chicken taquitos.  What we got were 3 small taqutios cut in half to make 6 total pieces. They were very tiny considering the price of  5.  I would say double the serving would have been appropriate given the price.  The margaritas are still good.  Also  the service was good.  I was bummed to see that they got rid of the old fashioned jukebox with actual CD s and replaced it with the newer electronic variety  but it does still offer a nice selection of music.
La Palapa,153,AMAZING food. HORRIBLE service. Our waitress said 5 words to us and 2 of those were not  thank you.  It takes effort to be that bad of a server. It felt like we we re ruining her life by wanting to eat.
La Palapa,154,Having been to La Palapa many times over the years  I can say with confidence that it really isn t worth the time. It isn t bad  but in a city with so many great Tex-Mex options  why bother with mediocre 
La Palapa,155,Service is awful.  Worst in the city.  Waited an hour once for food to come out for a large lunch group.  Food is okay.  Drinks are good.  Used to have a good party atmosphere on Thursday evenings.   Maybe still does.   The place will never be the same without Pete Benz playing on Thursday nights.
La Palapa,156,We have been going to this restaurant for at least a few years. The service and food have been typically been good. There were five in our party last night. My husband ordered breakfast for the first time  served all day . It was terrible  very bland cubed potatoes with greasy sunny side up eggs. I had a mango frozen margarita and it was not yummy as I ve had in the past. The mango flavor was scant and not very sweet as it usually is. My beef fajitas were also dry. My husband and others in our group had two margaritas each. I had only the one frozen margarita since I was driving my husband home.  When we were leaving  one of the servers asked me if I was ok to drive home  in front of all in our party . I was surprised at her question and told her that I was. She rudely replied because I looked red in the face. I was caught off guard by her rudeness and responded that I had only drank one margarita. She did not apologize but continued to stare at me. I am Caucasian with a fair complexion. I didn t feel flushed and I was not drunk by any means. I was walking fine and not slurring my words. I really have no idea why she had rudely spoke to me. I may have been a little warm which might have caused my face to redden but no one thought I would not be able to drive.  So my husband and I have decided that we will no longer eat at this restaurant. I was embarrassed in front of my party and irritated at the server s remarks. The unremarkable food and margaritas will not be missed. We will just have to wait if need be to eat at a better Mexican restaurant with nicer servers on a Thursday or weekend night.
La Palapa,157,This place is mediocre at best.  I got the chicken fajitas - they were flavorful but DRY.  So  no on the fajitas - go to Enchiladas Y Mas or El Caribe if you want some awesome beef or chicken fajitas.  My girlfriend got the cheese enchiladas.  They were bland and needed a good amount of salt.  Not sure it matters  but the filler cheese was white instead of the yellow that we prefer.  The House Margarita was even lacking - it was weak on the Tequila ... kinda tasted like Margarita Water.  Also  the interior is a dark  drab  and stuffy.  With the myriad of good Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin  I don t believe I ll be visiting La Palapa again.
La Palapa,158,this is a neighborhood restaurant for me - five minutes from my door to theirs - so i ve eaten here quite a few times over the years. this is good  not great  tex-mex offering good  not great  service. that said  if you re looking for solid tex-mex flavor at a decent price then la palapa delivers.  they are very accomodating to our family  two young kids who can be both noisy and messy at times   so this is a great location for families. we often bring the in-laws here for dinner when they visit because the food is consistently good  the drinks are strong and the atmosphere is fun.  the restaurant is split between the dining room and the cantina. the dining room is always quiet  relatively clean and seldom packed. the cantina is always rocking - especially on the weekends and  were i not loaded down with kids and diaper bags  i d likely avail myself of the karaoke and revelry   the food is decidedly average...for comparison i d put polvo s and pappasito s in the excellent range  baby a s and la palapa in the average range and tres amigos and jovita s in the poor range.  the enchiladas and tacos are always good and they offer several preparations of grilled chicken that are delicious. guacamole and salsa are both very tasty and the queso flameado is totally awesome.
La Palapa,159,Great drinks  good food and the best service ever    Rosa is the best  everyone should go in there and tip her well  cause she is awesome   
La Palapa,160,Dear La Palapa    My fiancee and I have been coming to your restaurant for two years now. We used to go to Amaya s but she became way too popular and crowded. Now we visit you quite frequently because you are our little east side secret. However  it would be selfish not to share with others your great qualities in the food and atmosphere   My favorite part about your restaurant is your daily specials. For  6 I can get an entire plate of fish tacos w  rice and beans. On other nights you offer up a huge portion of pork fajitas  and sometimes I have encountered shrimp enchiladas in a delicious Mexican red sauce. Your salsa is good  but made even better by a jumbo Mango margarita  This is the kind where you find puree in the bottom of your glass. I m starting to drool just thinking about it  We also never have to wait  and the food comes out fast and delicious every time.   Recently I have noticed more people in your restaurant. I am happy and sad at the same time-service has never lacked  but I feel that we are having to share  our  place now. It was inevitable  you have been here forever  but only now more people are discovering you. We have already been once this week  but will come in again for Sunday dinner-you re like family now. This gringa will have the special  and maybe some karaoke next door after a couple more Ritas   
La Palapa,161,I thought this place was just OK. My husband and fellow co-workers eat here so I wanted to give it a try. My plate was hot but the food on it was lukewarm  at best  and bland. The beans were dry and my enchilada was tasteless.
La Palapa,162,i have been to this establishment plenty of times and my experience last week was horrible  the manager on duty rosa was extremely rude. i don t care if she is has been working there for 15 plus years or is she is screwing her way to the top   she is rude and not manager material. they need to evaluate her customer service and manager skills.  juan should be manager he always has a great attitude and excellent customer service. ronnie was helpful and when i asked rosa for the persons info that was over her she was very comical and even more rude. even the other staff said rosa was rude. i will never go there again. i am already in contact with bbb.
La Palapa,163,Delicious fajitas across the way from Think Austin focus group facility. Pleasant friendly service and easy parking.
La Palapa,164,I love la palapa  and after having some other mexican places around austin  I really feel like they deserve at least 4 stars.  I ve gone back since my original review  and I think they ve really upped their customer service.  I would recommend the fajitas - the tortillas are great and taste very fresh   Since they stopped using or don t use refried beans as the default beans you receive with the fajitas  this along earns them 4 stars in my book.  This place is down the street for me  and my girlfriend and I consider it our kind of default  local tex mex place.  Love the atmosphere in the dining area too.
La Palapa,165,I used to go to La Palapa back in the early  90 s  and I thought it was a good place to eat.  Of course my taste was not as refined  so I ll never know.  Having not been there in 15 years  I thought I would go there today.  I really wanted to start with a good Margarita  so I picked the Mexican Martini off the drink menu.  It listed a premium tequila  and a premium orange liquor as the base for  8.75.  I watched the girl pour Jaurez tequila  sweet and sour  triple sec  and a couple of other things in the shaker.  When she handed it to me I asked why the premium tequila  and liquor had not been used.  She said that was extra     I showed her the menu  and got the same answer    Finally a manager came and made me one using the correct ingredients  but it was still horrible.  Ordered enchiladas  with borracho beans instead of refried  and my plate was in front of me before I could finish asking for a side of sour cream.   Of course the beans were refried  and looked like they should be put directly into the toilet instead of actually eating them.  The rice looked like it was a little old and way overcooked.  Enchiladas weren t bad  but that s probably because I just ordered cheese.  The salsa is good.  I won t go back.  Almost forgot.  They really need to clean that place.
La Palapa,166,Meh.  This place is just average  and on the pricier side on some lunch items.  Average just isn t good enough for Tex-Mex in Austin.  I went there simply because my lunch buddy is a teacher at Reagan and it was close by.  Service was...yeah  you guessed it  average.  Food wasn t quite what I expected in a chipotle sauce...almost seemed like the mistakenly put chile sauce in some form on my chicken.  It was red and just not the smokey heat I was looking for at all.  The veggies I had replaced the rice and beans with were decent  but they had potatoes as a filler for the zucchini  squash  onion and carrot mix.  Made it not quite jive.  My friend had the nachos...she didn t appear all that impressed either.  The place was pretty vacant in lunch rush  so I m guessing everyone around knows this isn t all that  but me.  I won t return unless I have to  as there are just so many better places for cheaper.  My entree was not worth the 11  bucks when I could have had better for 8 at Trudy s.
La Palapa,167,BEST F KIN CARNE GUISADA HERE  ....  food is generally so good here    place isnt too fancy tho  amp  is in a bad area in town... but worth it all for their food.
La Palapa,168,First and last time my family and I went there.  The service was ok...until my husband asked for some utensils....the waitress then asked him  why don t you use wipe off your kid s utensils and use those   in a not-so-polite tone.   Instead of apologizing  she walked off when my husband asked to speak to her manager about this.  Instead of the manager  another waitress came to finish the service.  After my husband asked her to please get the manager  she promptly took our plates before we were even finished eating  Never again....the food was ok.  Love Baby A s service and food a whole lot better.
La Palapa,169,I went to this restaurant on Friday with two of my girlfriends  and the new employee who served us was great.. After the new employee left  we were given a new waitress.. And she was completely and utterly rude. She made us wait 20 minutes for lemons because we were going to have shots. So I continued to go to the bar and pay for my shots to avoid having a tab with her. Next thing I know  she got upset and came back with a ticket saying that we had 2 shots we didn t order. I told her I wasn t paying for anything I didn t order  she continued to disrespect my friends and I at the next table.. By spitting insults at them about us. My friends and I decided to go outside to calm down  she preceded to run out the door and still harass us about the ticket  so the manager comes outside to discuss the issue and he said he feels bad and the owners don t have his back and nothing is going to happen to her he apologized and we didn t have to pay for the shots she claimed we bought.. And if the owners read this  she is on your website in the staff picture to the lower right hand corner with her hair pulled back. Also 3 African American costumers had previous complaints about this issue also. I will never go to this place again.. Or recommend it to anyone else.
Seareinas,1,The food was delicious and the michelada was bomb  The Banda was a huge plus  Great atmosphere.
Seareinas,2,SeaReina is definitely a restaurant to visit if you are looking for a taste of the state of Sinaloa  Mexico in terms of its food and atmosphere  this restaurant being an emblematic part of the Gabriela s family of restaurants  its concept is really striking  from the decoration and lighting that can fill any feed on social media as well as the creativity of its drinks and options of seafood and sushi  it should be noted that this restaurant is not suitable for those looking for a calm and quiet place since the music so loud both the DJ and the live events create an atmosphere full of party  as a Mexican who is used to growing up in this type of environment  it does not bother me  but for someone new to this experience  I do recommend bringing earplugs.  SeaReinas has enough parking space and also enough tables to spend a pleasant evening  although I recommend being aware of their social media channels since sometimes they have large events that limit space  especially for those who just want to eat.  The Michelada options are my favorites  especially if you like to enjoy a delicious snack with your drink  although I also recommend the Aguas Locas that are made with natural fruit and not instant drinks like in other places.  This time I had to try the smoked tuna tacos  which were delicious  but I also recommend the aguachile or the pissed off shrimp  Camarones Encabronados   although any option is really good.  Something to keep in mind is that most Mexican restaurants in Austin offer chips and salsa but in the case of SeaReinas and as is the tradition in seafood restaurants in Mexico  they serve you a small seafood broth and it is really worth it.  The service in all the occasions in which I have gone has always been excellent although it is necessary to remember that most restaurants are understaffed in the Austin area and this can sometimes slow down the service during the busiest hours but staff always has been kind.  SeaReina es definitivamente un restaurante a visitar si estas buscando una probadita del estado de Sinaloa  Mexico en cuanto a su comida y ambiente  siendo este restaurante parte emblem tica de la familia de restaurantes de Gabriela s  su concepto es realmente llamativo  desde la decoraci n e iluminaci n que puede llenar cualquier feed en las redes sociales as  como lo creativo de sus bebidas y opciones de comida del mar y el sushi  cabe destacar que este restaurante no es apto para aquellos que buscan un lugar tranquilo y silencioso  ya que la musica tanto del DJ como de los eventos en vivo crean un ambiente lleno de fiesta  uno como mexicano que esta acostumbrado a crecer en este tipo de ambientes no le hez molesto pero a alguien nuevo a esta experiencia si les recomiendo llevar tapones para los o dos.  SeaReinas cuenta con suficiente espacio de estacionamiento y tambi n suficientes mesas para pasar una velada agradable aunque recomiendo estar al pendiente de sus redes sociales ya que en ocaciones tienen eventos grandes que limitan el espacio especialmente para aquellos que solo quieren comer.  Las opciones de Micheladas son mis favoritas especialmente si te gusta disfrutar de una deliciosa botana con tu bebida aunque tambi n recomiendo las aguas locas que son de fruta natural y no de bebidas instant neas como en otros lugares.  En esta ocasi n me toco probar los tacos de at n ahumado que estuvieron deliciosos pero tambi n les recomiendo el aguachile o los camarones encabronados aunque cualquier opci n es rica la verdad.  Algo a tomar en cuenta es que la mayor a de restaurantes mexicanos en Austin ofrecen chips y salsa pero en el caso de SeaReinas y como es tradici n en restaurantes de Mariscos en Mexico  te sirven un peque o consom  de mariscos y la verdad vale la pena por que esta muy rico.  El servicio en todas las ocaciones en las cuales he ido ha sido siempre excelente aunque hay que recordar que la mayor a de restaurantes no tiene suficiente personal en el area de Austin y esto puede a veces alentar el servicio durante las horas m s ocupadas pero el trato siempre ha sido amable.
Seareinas,3,I LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE  It s just my type of vibe and the food and drinks were on point  I celebrated my birthday lunch here with my girls and I must say I d definitely be back... I love seeing El Chapo everywhere and Mal Verde.. the service was great  amp  there s a bunch of hottie waitresses  I definitely recommend this place if you re looking for great food and a variety of awesome drinks. We will definitely be back.
Seareinas,4,We got here and the place was going to close early  however they decided to seat us anyway. We were a party of 4 and the food did not disappoint. The waiter was great in assisting us and helping each of us order a dish that we would truly be satisfied with    The decor inside was simply so pretty  A spot where you could take a ton of cute instagram photos.   From the sushi to the nachos to the ceviche and the drinks  Everything was so delicious I would definitely try this spot again.   The only disappointment we had were some drinks and menu items were unavailable. But again we went right before closing time so I didn t dock their star based off of that.   If you are in Austin take a trip to this spot  You will love everything about it  The food ambiance and overall vibe of the staff 
Seareinas,5,Had a great time at seareinas we tried a variety of appetizers like the queso and the calamari  my personal favorite was the calamari  We tried the mango roll and oh goodness it did not disappoint  I would give it 5 stars the only thing is that the day we happened to stop by there was a band and it was overly loud  although the music was extremely pleasant to listen to  I think it was a little too loud for an indoor performance. We would have much more enjoyed it outside in their patio but overall our experience was great 
Seareinas,6,I had to give them 4 for the food and micheladas are pretty good during the week is not that busy but I think they re always changing staff and some of of the girls there have no idea what they re doing as it come to waiting... it s good for drinks and snacks buen ambiente tambi n
Seareinas,7,We went Saturday  around 2 30pm. Overall it s 5 stars for me because the food  ambiance and the service is really great   We sat down  the server gave us free soup  which is really good . We ordered our food and 10-15mins later we got it. My favorite are the calamari and the ceviche  the camarones encarborados is really good too if you love spicy food  Must try and we ll definitely go back  It s also a kids friendly coz there s a open patio that has games for kids.
Seareinas,8,OMG  This place is absolutely delicious. Real mariscos    The food is so flavorful. We flew in and stayed at the hotel next-door to this place. I had to eat twice there. I absolutely recommend it. We had the leche de Tigre  tacos El governador  caldo de camar n  ceviche de camar n and a sushi roll  WOW   And the Banda is a bonus 
Seareinas,9,Not many places does seafood well  and this is one of the few that does  I ordered a Baja Cali taco and my partner ordered something that was a whole fish that I can t remember. Both were really good  but the tacos were a little pricey for the portion I m getting. It was the same price as other dishes that had way more seafood than my tacos did. The ambience was great  but the music was extremely loud  so it s definitely not the place to be if you re trying to have a conversation over dinner. None of the servers wear mask  just for those who are interested to know that. Parking is plenty  but you do wanna come before 6pm as they charge a 20  cover after 
Seareinas,10,Pros  The sopa de cachucha we got as a welcome treat was best thing we had all night.   the fish and shrimp ceviche was large and really good and seasoned  chips were great.   Unlike other reviews I ve read  our waitress was super attentive and nice.    However  we did see food runners taking numerous plates to the wrong tables while we were there  so table number education is still an issue.    So-so  other dishes were ok  not memorable enough to return.  We fully expected the two sushi rolls we got to be novelty items and that s pretty much what they were.  Fish or rice quality doesn t really measure up yo the countless sushi choices around town that charge similar.   Cons  food prices are a tad high for what you get  but maybe that helps pay for the DJ   band that showed up as we were wrapping up.  The music was LOUD.  Like really loud.  Once the band started with their snare drum and multiple trumpets it took LOUD to the next level.  I d sit as close to the far back wall where the sushi bar is as humanly possible if I had to return.     Sadly  with all the great choices around town  not sure there will be a next time.   I d maybe return for some big soccer games if they don t blast music over the announcers as the big projector screen and numerous tv s are enticing.   We went at 6pm on a Thursday.   We really wanted to love this place as it s less than 10 mins from home  but our initial smiles and excitement for the decor and lively place slowly turned to thoughts of   damn  it s just too loud to sit here for an hour - hour and a half and eat.   Maybe crank the volume up at 8pm   One star off for the obnoxiously loud music  one star off for value for price.
Seareinas,11,Pleasantly surprised by this Mexican Seafood fusion spot   Glad I went on a Monday evening  I can tell this place gets packed. The same owners as the always-poppin Gabriela s  Seareinas has the same kind of fun and outrageous drink options and a good DJ. It is a huge space with a little outdoor area. They must have some good bands on the weekends  there is a big stage inside and signs saying there s a  25 cover.  We started with the seafood queso that s served inside of a pineapple. The title is misleading  as it is not a dip. It s more like a plate that comes with rice and bread. The flavors were epic  and they do not skimp out on the quantity of shrimp and octopus. Their tortillas are made to order and they were so good. The ceviche was another hit  I m normally not a big fan of fried sushi but we tried the Mal Verde roll and I ate it all. The rolls are unique and good quality all around. Good service and fast. I ll definitely be back 
Seareinas,12,Really good food and great service. The live music was a bit on the loud side so bring your earplugs but all around good experience  looking forward to bringing my mom
Seareinas,13,This is some of the best Mexican seafood I ve ever had. This was an overall experience I recommend everyone should check out. Awesome Mexican food with a live Mexican Banda  The music and the atmosphere is awesome. If you show up here on a weekend late at night you are in for a party environment.
Seareinas,14,Visited with a friend tonight  and unfortunately it wasn t all that and a bag of chips. We likely would not return.   Pros  easy and plentiful parking  cute decor with nice outdoors area  really delicious pina colada  Cons  service was awful- we waited nearly 20 min before anyone even came to our table after we were seated  and throughout the meal the waitress was nowhere to be found. My food was soggy and overcooked  and I m pretty sure it was frozen food that was just  overly  reheated. The music was wayyyy too loud- I was practically screaming at my friend. And finally  the chairs are so uncomfortable  especially if you re wearing shorts.   Overall it was just meh  and in a city like Austin with so many choices  there s just no reason to settle for subpar food and atmosphere.
Seareinas,15,I went on opening day which had a limited menu so I was sad I wasn t going to be able to have any of the sashimi plates or seafood platter with the crab legs. The inside is super cute and had a band playing so that was cool. Drinks are all super Instagram friendly. I wish they had a larger beer selection  at least 1 IPA on hand  can t do all sweet drinks. Luckily they were able to make a plain michelada  all the extra stuff on the top can be it s own meal. The shrimp platter was flavorful but the shrimp was so over cooked that the meat stuck to the shell. Oysters were HUGE but the cocktail sauce was boring and I ended up using the shrimp sauce to get through them all. The ceviche was really good  you just have to eat it fast so the tostada doesn t get soggy. I ll give it some time before returning.
Seareinas,16,Great vibes  great food  great drinks    JUST TOO LOUD. Live band is mid. Prefer DJ but with the music not too loud because you can t have a conversation. The place is not build for the level of high music the play.  Outside is awesome  But there is no service. They should service the outside.
Seareinas,17,So I was very excited to try this place but the seafood was a huge letdown. We were the first guest of the day so it could be they were not prepped yet.  Our server was very nice and helpful she was attentive through our whole meal.  The Paloma and Sandia Agua Fresca were flavorful making me think this place is more of just a bar for sips and chips.  The tripe app was good but the mini shrimp in the app had no flavor and seemed under cooked.   Then we tried the Aguachille Oysters. I know oysters are raw but I had one that had raw shrimp on top as well.  Made me pretty sick   The sushi was very fried and barely had any of the toppings that were listed mainly just rice and tempura. So don t come here for the JapLatino mix.  The tacos were a bit of a let down too because the salad that came with was so sour it leaked towards the tacos making them so soggy. Maybe plate them separately so that the flavors do not mix.   Overall would come for drinks but would not try the food. I hurled my entire meal before leaving the restaurant and it was not a cheap meal 
Seareinas,18,The food was great. I got the Mango sushi  and it was so unique and different  I loved it. The Baja Cali Taco was my favorite. We also got cantaloupe and watermelon juice   which were both heavenly. The scenery was awesome and the waitress was very nice  I want to come back
Seareinas,19,No words to explain their food. I went in with the impression that it was just a  bar  but I was wrong the food is amazing and so are the drinks. The waitress was attentive and made sure all our needs were met. Best Place to watch Canelo  match 
Seareinas,20,I have never been to a place where I was so disrespected. It seems like if you are not part of a certain group you can t get in. We were polite in asking to get back into line because my girlfriend had to get her ID from the car and the security said   not my f problem   . To make things worse  we were this place was recommended by someone at Gabriela s downtown and when we asked to speak to a certain person we were told they had no business talking to us. This is pretty sad since we just wanted to check out another one of the good places Gabriela s has. Sorry but very very disappointed and disrespected.
Seareinas,21,The food was good the drinks where easy to drink and the service was great just be ready to pay bc the prices are a bit high and the food quality is alright. If the process dropped it would be 5 stars
Seareinas,22,This place was a total let down. I follow an IG star and they posted about this place. I keep forgetting that those  influencers  get paid. The owner definitely needs to get her priorities straight or else this place isn t going to last.   While the ambiance is what you see on social media  every thing else is absolutely terrible. As soon as you walk in  you re met with hosts that are clueless with bad attitudes  Then you have an episode of confusion trying to figure out if this is a club or a restaurant with the obnoxious music literally blasting so loud you can t even hear yourself think. Once I sat down  im met with an incompetent waitress  while I think she tried  she kept disappearing. The food tasted like it came from a cafeteria. The rice was cold with no flavor and the fish tacos tasted very basic. I can tell the food wasn t fresh because my plate came out in less than 5 minutes. She also ended up double charging my friends CC  which took forever to find help.  I would not recommend nor do I plan to return.  If they want this place to be remotely successful  they need to care less about insta followers and more about the actual experience and food.
Seareinas,23,One of the fun places to grab drinks in Austin  All the seafood is super fresh and presentation is amazing. I recommend their banda night....super fun    
Seareinas,24,Absolutely can t wait to try this place again. There was so much I wanted to try on the menu. The location is pretty cool and Instagramable if that s your thing. Every table gets a bowl of hot soup to cleanse the palette for the beginning of the meal. The serving sizes are very generous. While drinking my wonderful margarita  I notice a beverage being served in a pineapple. It was incredibly popular. I figured  these customers must know what s up. I ordered the pi a colada and I regret nothing. It was absolutely delicious and so large that I could not finish it. Anyway  all this to say is the food is delicious. The sushi options are inspiring  Go and get it  
Seareinas,25,Food was horrible we got the wings they were all soggy no flavor what so ever then we decided to get chicken nachos the half of the cheese wasn t melted we got frozen  Mango margarita they were water before we knew it pretty much have to drink them fast if you don t want them to be hot music was so loud you couldn t hear person next to you all Together bad ... their was one of their security guards drinking on the job he was drunk not to mention he had his gun on him was so drunk they had to sit him down and eat So he could sober up I got it all on video even him holding the margarita this is unsafe gun practice we sent  800 and still service was bad
Seareinas,26,The food was delicious and very authentic. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is one of high energy so there s good music playing at a higher than normal volume so if you re not into that  that may not be a high mark for you. I loved it however and will definitely be back 
Seareinas,27,Just try it  Will not be disappointed   So glad we stopped and ate here  will definitely be back.
Seareinas,28,Really good sinaloense food. I love good ceviche and listeneing to music at the same time. People havr been saying music is loud but in all honesty if you just want the quiet sit down and eat spot this might not be it. This place is fun. Good music  really good food  great drinks and an overall great atmosphere.   Oysters chapito were amazing  camaron zarandiado was good just needed a but more sauce but good overall. Agua chile rojo was delicious as was the sliced tuna pieces. The people we came with had the trio tostadas  pulpo and pescado ceviche tostadas and they enjoyed them all.   I would deff recommend coming here  ill be coming back again for sure but next time on friday to enjoy the banda.
Seareinas,29,Awesome Place looked cool inside  Live Banda loud af but awesome  Food was above average.
Seareinas,30,Not a great experience. Food wasn t great for the price  and service was slow  and the sad part was when we went it wasn t busy. Would recommend this place for drinks  but not for food.
Seareinas,31,I m sure this place would do great in Sinaloa but this is Austin.  Lots of things to like  huge place  decent food and drinks  house band  overshadowed by the lack of class by their waitstaff  manager  security.  Lots of potential but need to clean up their act.  I hope they can figure it out.
Seareinas,32,You are paying for the candles and the scenery. Food is not good. Also double check you bill they automatically charge a 40  tip at bar
Seareinas,33,We sat on the pink side with the snake wall paper. Fish tasted fresh and the food was great. Our server only spoke Spanish so thankfully out of our group I speak Spanish. Everyone was very accommodating and the vibe and music was perfect. The wait sorta sucked  but it s new so what can you expect. The margaritas were strong af Pero like I m not complaining. The strawberry sushi roll was quite interesting. I m still trying to figure out if I liked it. Overall I d definitely go back.
Seareinas,34,First timer here. The Pina Para La Ni a was great  Great appetizers and food. Our waitress Lucia was great  Definitely worth a visit.
Seareinas,35,I took my entire family here before scouting it out by myself  was just going by Instagram pics  --the food is terrible. So greasy and so much weird seasoning on all of the food. Three of us ordered the tuna tacos and they were disgusting. My husband ordered beef tacos and those were kind of edible. Other people ordered cheese dip and other appetizer stuff but it was just bad. The chips were good though.  Cocktails were great  The waiter was awesome too.
Seareinas,36,Worst place I have ever been to. The sushi was soooo bad and overpriced for how terrible it was. They had a strawberry roll that just taste like its smothered in jelly and you could barley taste the fish. I ate one and had to spit it out. The other roll was covered in heavy thick mayo and had only imitation crab and no fish. There might be some decent dishes there but everything we got was awful and we had a huge bill for food we couldn t eat.    staff was nice but they never filled up our waters and seemed confused. Maybe they were new.
Seareinas,37,I liked the music and atmosphere. One big issue  everything s overpriced. Food and drinks are not that great for the price.
Seareinas,38,Delicious everything. Soup  food drinks. Great service and lots of space. Sports in TV screens everywhere. Night club vibe. DJ was spinning great Latin beats.
Seareinas,39,Don t ever come here  they don t limit alcohol at all    The guy sitting in front of us literally peed on the floor and the management didn t do anything but asked him to leave. Horrible management and food
Seareinas,40,The food is super good here. The drinks are delicious  and the sushi is superb. They have live music on the weekends.
Seareinas,41,I had high hopes for this location. Decor and ambiance is typical for a Mariscos restaurant but the service was horrible. Wait was over an hour when there was plenty of empty tables all over. Staff was very unprofessional and attire not suitable for food handling.  Our waitress Gabriella was not attentive and when they brought two micheladas with shrimp for two people in our party and it was sent to another table. The other patrons had them for over 10mins and wether they touched the drinks or not our server thought it was still ok to give them to us. My two friends returned them and then the server said they were taking long to make because management didn t believe it was sent to the wrong table.  Our food came out before our appetizers came out . We had to ask our server to remove our empty plates repeatedly since she didn t think she had to check up on us. I understand it s a holiday weekend but we saw other waitresses under the same pressure attending their tables better. Our server was also taking tequila shots with the table next to us  which could have inhibited her from doing her job correctly. No condiments were provided as well  the runner bringing out the food constantly asked us if food belonged to our table when we didn t order it. They are all confused and seems like systems are not in place to do their job efficiently or they re just too lazy to care.  The concept of the restaurant seems great but service is horrible I will definitely not be coming back.
Seareinas,42,The place is beautiful the food and the drinks are good  but the music is overwhelmingly loud. Went with my pregnant friend and she had to leave because it was wayyy to loud. It s impossible to have a conversation there because you won t be able to hear  or even hear yourself think.
Seareinas,43,This is a fabulous place to have food  drinks and listen to live band music. Lots of great menu items as well as drink specialties. The place is HUGE  lots of elbow room. We were here on a Saturday night which was exactly what we were looking for   The staff was super accommodating  friendly and very welcoming.
Seareinas,44,Have really good food if you are coming to visit Austin you should come here so cute inside
Seareinas,45,Kind of like a seafood hooters. Tried the rice something that s very hard to mess up but yet the only  spice  on that thing were the bell peppers lol. It s basically a club with below average food.
Seareinas,46,Great food  Drinks were amazing as always. Their ceviche was my favorite thing we ordered. Karina was super awesome  amp  friendly  amp  knew the menu pretty well
Seareinas,47,The food was Amazing  I also had a Pina Colada and it was soooo yummy  Came with a group of friends and we all loved everything  Our server Lucia was so sweet and great as well  If you re in Austin you must go  
Seareinas,48,My friend and I were very excited to eat here after seeing all of the delicious looking posts. We ordered an appetizer and some ceviche tostadas which were both good along with some micheladas. Tostados were loaded with ceviche  The issue we had was with the service. It took about 20 min from getting seated for anybody to attend us. Overall the service was very slow to get anything. We ordered the queso ranchero and they only brought out 2 tortillas and forgot the basket of chips which took about another 10 minutes to get. We saw the runner walking around table to table to see if they ordered the ceviche tostadas which sure enough turned out to be ours 4 tables later. The service made the experience disappointing. This was their second week after opening and I am hoping service has improved to this business a second chance.
Seareinas,49,So a couple of weeks ago we headed to this place to celebrate my friends bday  we got there super early to make sure we can be seated  as we were a group of 20. I had called about RSVP  but they said no  they do not do RSVP but to get there early so they can accommodate. So we got there around 530pm  we told the host we were a group of 20 she told us that she would not be able to seat more than 10 ppl together because they are not able to put more tables together. I told her that was fine but to make sure that whatever two tables they provide us with that we are close to each other so the group can be close to each other. She then told us that she was not able to guarantee this because they were not able to put us with the same server and each server has an area. I told her i understand that but we are a group celebrating a bday why would we want to be all scattered. -Hostess very rude  with an attitude and in great need of wardrobe change. Well we asked to be seated as there was 10 out of the 20 already there  when they are about to seat us I asked where are you planning on seating the rest of the group  she literally point across the restaurant by the wall  the table where she put us was by the entrance of the place. i was like oh no this is not going to work. I asked to speak to the manager  who finally came  didn t get his name  i told him the situation and he said that they couldn t accommodate  and that that is why they prefer not to have large group because it is very inconvenient. I told him so it does not matter that we are spending money here at the end it is business and it would be nice to work with us. I asked if we can just sit all the adults in one table and then the kiddos in two tables he said sure whatever. So finally  we were seated of course after making a big fuss. Manager dj was super super unprofessional and such a bad his attitude  never again. I do have to say our server was super amazing  she was great with us  took our orders drinks  food  etc  she got everything right and was very attentive  she took care of the whole group on her own it was amazing. We made sure to tip her well because she went above and beyond. We did try to make it easy for her to so that it can get done quick. But truly just such a great lady  she accommodated for the cake we brought. Even though we had such a bad deal at the beginning she came through and made up for the rest of the time we were there. Will we go back again  chances NO....very rude employees who honestly believe are the owners and they say is final....no concept of customer services....our waitress again was Great but that was it  food not too bad.
Seareinas,50,Pulpo de la brasas was my favorite dish by far. Service was great. Thank you Lucia for serving our table.
Seareinas,51,If you come here make sure you bring headphones with a radio set on it cause it gets LOUD  you have to yell at the person next to you. But no the less they have great drinks. The musicians will make their way around the restaurant and play their instruments. Appetizers are good. Be prepared to wait a while for your drinks to come out. They look great and taste great  except the mojito don t get that  but other then that great food and atmosphere.
Seareinas,52,Super cute and fun restaurant. Had the green aguachiles and they did not disappoint  Our servers were pretty new training  however they were extremely kind 
Seareinas,53,I was definitely looking forward to the opening of this restaurant and I think it will be a great addition to the diversity of culinary experiences in the area. The decor and vibe is great. It almost gives you a bar club feel. I went on a Sunday during lunch time. The food was good. I started with a sushi roll as an appetizer. It was the one with the mango. it was very good. For my meal I got the pineapple with shrimp  asked for the octopus to not be included . It was really good and had plenty of shrimp in it. The soup that they gave us to start off  it was complimentary  was absolutely amazing. My only critique would be the seasoning. Although I love well seasoned food  the salt level that day was through the roof. When I go back again and try something else  I ll happily change my star rating to five. They have plenty of free parking and the inside is big with plenty of space for large parties. I do wish they would accept reservations.
Seareinas,54,Great food and awesome atmosphere.  They served a soup at the beginning that was so delicious. Highly recommend this spot  especially for a date night.
Seareinas,55,Lainey was our waitress and she was wonderful  she was very sweet and came by our table often  but not too often that you felt rushed . It is a bit expensive but the food is worth it because the plates are well served and delicious. The mango sushi was really good  but my favorite were the camarones encabronados  seriously delicious.
Seareinas,56,Great food  great drinks  great service.  Korina was super awesome  Totally reccomend it. Also if you like a Latin vibe this is a unique environment.
Seareinas,57,Food was amazing and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu  Also super clean establishment 
Seareinas,58,I was really hoping to like it the place is really nice and everything else . But the customer service was horrible . My friends and I went out 2 06 22 to hang out and eat . We didn t know a band would be playing so we were really hyped being our first time at the restaurant . I have worked as a server and as a host but the host here was horrible bad attitude didn t even help us out on why we never received a text to see when our table was ready . Went up to her 5 times waited 2 hours and we finally gave up and left . Only paid 25 dollars for nothing . Honestly very disappointed .
Seareinas,59,This place is garbage. The service is horrible and they take at least 20 minutes to come and take your order and even longer to bring your drinks. As for the food  it took a smooth hour and a half to get my food. Kept getting told that the kitchen kept messing up the order. The only good thing there is the parking and the live band. That s about it. Don t waste your money at this shitty ass seafood place  your better off somewhere else or at Captain D s or Long John s.
Seareinas,60,Went to dinner last night at Seareinas the food was excellent the atmosphere was great the music was just way too loud. We asked the manager if he would seek us at the back of the restaurant which he did but we still had a hard time carrying a conversation because the music was just too loud.
Seareinas,61,The food was amazing      Everything cake out super quick and Lucia was absolutely delightful. She checked on us and was very attentive.
Seareinas,62,We came in on Saturday for lunch and there was no wait time  The food was great and the service was great  Liz our waitress was the best 
Seareinas,63,The food was amazing  the portions were definitely filling for someone that s coming in hungry. Lucia was very attentive with our table and made sure we were taken care of. I would come back again.
Juana Taco,1,This is a solid taco truck  This is coming from a person who has eaten from countless taco mobiles during my time on earth. I m not sure if that necessarily makes me an expert  but I ll gladly purport my self to be one.             I can only speak to the breakfast tacos and must admit they are quickly rising to the top of my list for places to procure my morning time deliciousness in a tortilla. Service is courteous and orders are accurate. This is valley style Mexican food of which I m a huge fan. It might not be everyone s cup of tea.              Also I should say  there s a couple of variations of valley style that are still authentic  but might not be exactly what you had at one of the million trucks in the valley. The valley is a large enough region to have variation in the cuisine  so keep that in mind my fellow taco snobs  I highly suggest scooping up some legit tacos at this joint 
Juana Taco,2,Went in before work one day and omgeeeee so good  The ladies are super sweet  It was drizzling outside so they told me to stand by their house and brought my food to me. I  had the   migas  and it was PERFECT  I can t wait to return.
Juana Taco,3,Dry and greasy means you overcooked it and let it sit in bullshit to try and make it moist. Serious disgrace and wouldn t want refund or replaced..  seriously man you aren t the first bs taco truck thats not fresh.  sorry sir you are an idiot and are the perfect example of a dumba   with no food knowledge
Juana Taco,4,Juana Tacos  food truck came to my office so I had to try. The fajita tacos were delicious  but the tortilla seemed a bit soggy. I love flour tortillas and maybe it was cooked enough  Not sure. The spices on the beef tasted good  but it had a different flavor..maybe they also used the grill top to cook liver or some other insides meats. I wasn t a fan of the taste. If I go back  I ll have to try the chickens
Juana Taco,5,Happy Happy Happy. The only words to describe Juana Taco.  Their Red salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious but  the verde sauce...can t get enough. I am addicted. It s good on everything. Ask for extra.  You can t go wrong with the Gringa taco. Get that with a side of Elote and their fresh corn chips and it is a solid 10 10 meal.   Only thing missing was Horchata  which I hope makes an appearance in the future.  I will definitely be back.
Juana Taco,6,I m on the fence about this truck  but overall  the food is good  the amount of meat and ingredients in the taco is pretty generous  and I guess they re trying to put themselves on the premium end of the taco spectrum.  Flavorful meats. Tortillas are what they should be.    The only reason I m in the fence is because the price. They recently increased to  5.00 for a Juana Taco  which is probably the most I ve ever paid for a taco that isn t some unnecessarily glitzy modern Mexican place downtown.  Two tacos is over  10 which is expensive considering I don t have money leftover for a drink or a side of rice or beans.    The only reason I pay is because I m a lazy MFer who doesn t want to get in my car to drive and get some food because they show up at my work parking lot every once in a while.    I guess you get what you pay for.  That craphole called Taco Ranch has cheap tacos but they re absolutely terrible.
Juana Taco,7,I mean the food wasn t terrible but it isn t what it states to be which is  authentic flavorful Mexican food.  As someone from the valley who knows what authentic Mexican food tastes like this isn t it. If you re charging more than 4 dollars a taco it should at least be true to what you re stating it is. The queso to start off wasn t homemade but tasted like velveeta cheese. Which don t get me wrong isn t gross  but it s not authentic. The quesadilla was decent but the refried beans tasted canned or burned. The papa asada was super salty. I will say the salsa verde was pretty good so there s a plus. It s a super cute spot though.
Juana Taco,8,Not that busy on a Friday morning. Thought it was just because it was early  but even with no other customers he service was slow for just a few tacos. Price is pretty outrageous for the quality of food we were given.  The tortillas were the worst part  the texture of cardstock paper and taste of cardboard. Literally I m not even trying to be funny. My MOTHER makes better Chorizo and Egg  and the only good thing was the egg  potato and cheese. The cheese on the bean and cheese wasn t even melted  and the beans were lackluster. Never had a bad tortilla in Texas before  but if you want to find one  come here.
Juana Taco,9,Noon on a Tuesday  no customers. I ordered a Juana Taco from the workers recommendation  was about  5 and some change and took about 4mins. With tip  8 for a mediocre taco  plenty of other taco spots with superior food that cost less.
Juana Taco,10,Truck came to my office for lunch so I gave it a try. I ordered a veggie tostada and a veggie taco. Coworkers had a Juana bowl  bean and cheese taco  and chips and guacamole. My tostada was pretty good- didn t come with any salsa and needed salt. Beans didn t taste fresh- seemed to be canned but overall  wasn t bad. My taco  on the other hand  was very meh. The veggie filling wasn t seasoned well  taco had no cheese  and the tortilla was so over cooked it was basically a tortilla chip. The Juana bowl was very skimpy as was the guac. The prices are inconsistent- some things are reasonable and then others shoot up to  12 . Overall  it s not the worst thing ever but in Austin with so many amazing food trucks and taco options  I would pass.
Juana Taco,11,I won t be eating at Juana Taco again. I wanted to try their al pastor  so I ordered al pastor w  raw onions  amp  cilantro on corn tortilla and the queso chips. Simple. It came out fast  I was first in line at taco truck  and when I got back to my office  opened my taco and there s barely any onion and cilantro - almost non-existent. I couldn t taste them at all. The pastor was dry and tasteless. The one lime they provided didn t help any.  The queso was fine. The chips weren t my favorite...a bit too oily in my opinion but whatever. I had to eat lunch so I forced myself to finish the taco and then snacked on the queso afterwards. Would not recommend.   The gentleman who was cashier was very nice though.
Juana Taco,12,Overall  great flavors from the tacos  but a couple things keep me from giving 5 stars.     The Good  staff was extremely friendly.  I didn t have cash so the staff made my food while I ran to an ATM.  The flavors were great   The flavors of the taco were great.     The bad   My wife and I agreed that the amount of food was not sufficient to warrant the cost.  The tacos are priced similarly to torchys.  I can get 2 torchys tacos and be full.  I was hungry after 3 of these  and my tiny petite wife was also still hungry after three.      Overall  the flavors of the food and the nice staff was enough to give these guys another try.  Hopefully next time they add some more meat to the tacos.
Juana Taco,13,What a great find on a Sunday morning.  We had the place to ourselves.  The music was hopping and made the wait bearable.  It was worth it because the tacos were killer. Had a couple of migas tacos the were damn good.  Great taste and a good size.  The ladies working the truck were very gracious. I ll be back.
Juana Taco,14,These are some of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. The corn tortilla is prepared to that heavenly spot where it is dense  fluffy  and spongy all at once. The chorizo is not too greasy  but still has punch. The service is fast and the gents are nice   
Juana Taco,15,PUT THAT GREEN SAUCE ON EVERYTHING. I m addicted  Red salsa is also fresh and delicious but that green sauce...can t get enough. For real. It s good on everything. Ask for extra.   Honestly  u can t go wrong with the migas tacos  though sometimes there s too much cheese...I know  can there ever be too much cheese    the pirata or the plain ole chicken tacos with onion and cilantro. I love that grilled onions are an option because some days I can t get the taste of raw out of my mouth  even though I love the crunch . The papas are insanely large - u must be ravenous and ready to commit.   Multiple vibrantly colored picnic tables are always clean and they have a cute stage my kids danced on while we ate and enjoyed the ambiance. Employees are friendly and everything is made to order.   I would LOVE for them to offer some sort of bowl option in the future and maybe a dessert  churros  Flan  Surprise us     It s a yummy place in a great up and coming area  and we will definitely be back.
Juana Taco,16,Honest real review here  sorry not sorry ...   - Breakfast tacos were  frankly  poor. Not a fan of the artificial tasting yellow cheese  admittedly I m not huge into tex-mex  I like my cheese white  - Despite being not that busy  wait was pretty long  they did apologize though  - A little too expensive.   18 for 4 breakfast tacos and water  Honestly  we only went here because all the other places nearby were packed and we were starving. The grade inflation in Austin Yelp is crazy  I hope this place can improve because the people working seemed genuinely nice and they got a pretty cool spot  but next time I ll wait it out at Paperboy.
Juana Taco,17,Pretty delicious. The elote  guacamole and tacos are very on point  I had the Juana taco and Barbacoa. Both delicious  the Juana was better though. Over all great delicious food and the owner is very friendly and welcoming. Definitely recommend
Juana Taco,18,Service is great  food is good - but this is the second time my order was incorrect. Ordered two bean and cheese add avocado - got to office only to find NO avocado  which of course I paid extra for      Last time  I got home with a completely different taco than I ordered.   I do appreciate the friendly service  and the fact you can call your order in...but if you can t get what you ordered  rather not bother.
Juana Taco,19,I live around the corner from this place and finally did some research on the truck and found out they are South Texas  influenced  so I had to drop by. After mulling over whether tacos  papa asada or panchos I decided it was a weekend so time for panchos.   I don t know where panchos started but I swear I ve only seen them in south Texas and this place really did them justice. They re essentially just loaded nachos  but a little bit more Mexican  diced tomatoes onions galore  fajita meat sprinkled throughout  etc. They chips are great  they seemed home-fried and everything else is what I would expect  flavorful meat  fresh toppings  including guac  and a humongous portion for 11 bucks. If you re from the Valley or know of the food  the place reminded me of the menu of Taqueria El Zarape  the panchos reminded me of the nachos from El Pato . I ll be back to try the papa asada and see if they really got the touch or it was just a lucky night.   The only reason I dock a star is bc I m really weary of places that charge more than  3 for a taco  yes  even though I didn t have one .  4 for a taco would get you run out of the Valley  so maybe that s why they had to drive the cocina up 35 to Austin. I know the taco craze has the city in a stranglehold right now but no chingues  those tortillas better be homemade by the virgencita herself bro....
Juana Taco,20,Juana taco is never busy usually a red flag in Austin   so if you re looking for quick food this is the spot. Tacos are cooked fresh and orders are taken quickly. Portions are large  largest tacos I ve gotten in Austin.   I ve tried it twice  once for lunch tacos  campechano  amp  pirate  and once for breakfast tacos  chorizo  amp  migas .   I don t really need to go over tacos individually as they were all lacking in flavor and overly greasy. I left the chorizo taco on my counter for 45 mins and the grease had saturated one side of the bag. The chorizo did not even taste like chorizo  more of a random low quality meat. The al pastor and beef fajita were cooked fine  they just didn t taste like anything except grease. My stomach was actually upset by the lunch tacos.   I figured I d at least give them a second shot before leaving a review  but even the second try disappointed. In a town with so many taco joints trucks shacks it s impossible to recommend.   Large portions of lackluster food. 2 5 would definitely not recommend.
Juana Taco,21,Perfect breakfast taco truck. The tortillas were homemade. Migas piping hot and delicious. Barbacoa portion was enormous.  The space is also much improved with a clean lot and lots of picnic tables. Definitely worth a try 
Juana Taco,22,Big  filling  meaty tacos  memorable for the strong flavor. I had a barbacoa and a pirata taco  combined  this was too much for lunch and I tossed a portion of it away.  This is more of a tex-mex style taco  it s a big corn tortilla covered by a layer of melted cheese that fails to seal the tortilla from the moistness of a large gob of mushed-up meat mixed with minced onion. The mess is not structurally sound  so it s wrapped in a layer of tin foil. Break the seal with caution and perform your initial explorations with a fork. The tortilla is doomed  you will never be able to lift it to your mouth. Treat the thing more like a burrito.
Juana Taco,23,The migas tacos will change your life -- definitely worth a visit IMO 
Juana Taco,24,Super legit breakfast tacos. Ordered the migas and added bacon. Delicious and the service was great.   
Juana Taco,25,Overpriced and very costly for what you get.  I received a prepacked fajita taco not how I ordered it.  I was charged for a tip on my card when I tipped in cash.  I was refunded the charge  but the food is not worth it.
Juana Taco,26,Very reasonably priced  delicious tacos with a very friendly staff. I will definitely be back.
Juana Taco,27,I got a chicken quesadilla from the food truck on Dec. 18 and it was delicious  I love cheesy quesadillas and they did not disappoint  so I definitely recommend them if you find their food truck.
Juana Taco,28,Tacos were good  had the Barbacoa  pastor  but not life changing. Their biggest issue is pricing.  4- 5 per taco is just way to high. Especially when I can get superior tacos from places right down the road for less. I was pretty disappointed.
Juana Taco,29,This morning I went to Tacodeli and waited 15 mins for my breakfast. When I asked about it they said we re running behind schedule  with out even checking for my ticket then came back to tell me they lost my ticket. I requested a refund and left disappointed because I m pregnant and hungry  and didn t want to be late for work.   Saw the amazing Juana Taco truck at my job  Barton Skyway and mopac  and tried to run my card as credit   suffering from baby brain I forgot my husbands pin on his card  it didn t go through so I apologized and was leaving. The gentleman that took my order called me back and said he d take care of it for me. Thank you so much for making an incredibly crappy morning better.   You ve restored my faith in humanity  lol. That simple kind gesture to a complete stranger  is appreciated more than you know sir  I ve been taco converted and yalls tacos are way better anyway  Thank you so much.
Juana Taco,30,Just had the Pirata taco and Corn in the Cup.   Let s start with the good. The taco was stuffed and the fillings was above par. Food came out fast.  Now lets get to the the bad. The corn in the cup was absolutely terrible. This is a failed dish. The corn was not fresh corn and it was straight out of the can. The cup had no flavor and consisted of too much water butter water. This there off the consistency. Honestly  the dish is horrendous.  The tortilla... Hhmm..says homemade...Hhmm no comment.  My biggest compliment and reviews depends on this simple answer to to rhis question.    Would I return as a customer   - NO
Juana Taco,31,I ve had this food truck once before some specialty taco  worth every penny.  Today however  I paid over  8 for chips and quac and a beans  amp  rice  taco .  I was not impressed by the flavor of any of it.  Not the beans  rice or guacamole.  The tortilla even seemed like one of those gluten free craps from H-E-B... And the chips were over cooked and meh.  I ate it though because I was hungry but I probably won t ever go back.    sorry.
Juana Taco,32,A little overpriced  brown avocados  and suboptimal cheese. Corn tortillas were decent  but I probably won t go back.
Juana Taco,33,Terrible tortilla  over priced and poor customer service. The eggs were good though  but make a better choice than this.
Juana Taco,34,This place is authentic  I was craving a baked potato loaded with fajita and I gotta say my craving was for-filled   The excellent service and friendly staff is doing it up  Highly recommend this place for anyone wanting the best baked potatoes in Austin     The tacos are also made with  Real  flour tortillas which is a must for me. The fajita and pastor were spot on as well   Thanks for the awesomeness on my lunch order today 
Juana Taco,35,First had Juana Taco s at the 2017 Bowie Highschool homecoming so yummy   Today they are on campus at my office and have a very happy tummy   Their ingredients are so fresh and yummy   Looking forward to the next time they visit  Enjoyed the classic Juana Taco and the Gringa  el pastor .
Juana Taco,36,Couldn t understand adding cheese to a taco  didn t get the quantity correct and when I asked for the extra tacos I paid for the fella said that I didn t actually need that many tacos because  they re pretty big tacos ...
Juana Taco,37,I love this truck. I ve only had the pleasure of having the breakfast tacos   they only come to my job in the morning . The service is quick but the product is great. It s a bit on the pricey side.
Juana Taco,38,Great tacos  grilled tortillas are an excellent touch.  I ve only had the breakfast tacos  but they absolutely hit the spot and are generous in size.  Their hot sauce is a do a wannabe but still pretty good.  I have a taco deli 5 mins from me but I love their migas here
Juana Taco,39,Great spot with friendly service- nice big picnic tables with umbrellas and great vegetarian options 
Juana Taco,40,Ok  so before I begin I should probably admit that I patronize this truck often enough for them to know my name.  But with good reason. Everything is delicious   Breakfast carne asada taco is amazing  Beef is tender and the taco is huge. Pirata taco is equally as good. But my favorite has to be the torta. It comes with a small side of chips and salsa. Don t miss the salsa  Ask nicely and they ll give you both hot and mild which are fantastic.
Juana Taco,41,The tacos and fajitas are pretty good  but they are wayyyy overpriced. A single taco costs  4 . They aren t very big. The one thing that they have going for them is that they don t skimp on meat. The hot sauce was not as great  lots of spice but not much flavor.
Juana Taco,42,I went to their food truck for a breakfast taco but was disappointed.  The first thing I noticed was that their prices were more than 1.5x what another place near my work sells so that immediately turned me off.  But I thought maybe they would be far superior  or much larger  and worth the extra price.  I ordered the bacon and egg taco and they asked me if I wanted cheese and I said yes.  After a short wait I got my taco.  As far as I could tell they forgot to add the cheese  and the rest of the taco was underwhelming.  Though you could tell the tortilla was homemade  it was thin  dry and greasy  like the dough was old and hadn t been cooked all the way.  It was not very flavorful  just very mediocre all around.  I might have just come on the wrong day or ordered the wrong thing  but I probably won t be back.
Juana Taco,43,Hi the food here is good however it s not my favorite food truck.  The meat was good tasting and well flavored  the staff was friendly and polite  however for Mexican food i thought it was a bit pricey  I was expecting like street tacos which you see at typical taco trucks.  I had the gringa taco and straight up chicken taco  I liked them both but if they were street taco style I would have enjoyed them way more.  Anyways I will be trying other stuff there soon.
Juana Taco,44,This truck is usually in the parking lot of the arboretum plaza every other Friday. I ll admit that when they first came I almost didn t try it because of the prices. In a moment of desperation for Mexican food  I tried the sincronizada. Ermahgerd    F    that s delicious  I ve also tried the pirata taco  torta  and chips and salsa. Juana taco never disappoints. The tortillas and chips look and taste hand made  something I expect from every Mexican food place but RARELY find in Austin. Seriously  the flour tortillas alone deserve 5 stars. Both the red and green salsa are awesome. Red is mild. Green is spicy. The meat  chicken and beef  is perfectly seasoned. I mean  really  you re wasting time reading this review. You could be eating at Juana Taco right now.
Juana Taco,45,Tacos were incredible. I juana more. I ll be back tomorrow morning to try the breakfast tacos 
Juana Taco,46,The taco was so messy that I had to eat it with a rock and knife. Also I think I was over charged for building my own taco. I paid  4  they have very few tacos at that price range  for a potato  bean and pico taco. It just wasn t a great experience. Also the potatoes are not seasoned at all. I ordered two tacos and couldn t stand to eat the second. There is this food truck garden nearby that has this great taco place that I will probably stick to.
Juana Taco,47,We found Juana on a dive-by in east Austin looking for breakfast tacos. Juana tacos provides fresh  authentic breakfast tacos. We had four different options... the migas on corn tortilla was amazing. The portions are generous and if I lived in Austin I d be a regular. Well done   
Juana Taco,48,This little food truck is a delight to eat at. Located in a lot decorated in style with plenty of room to eat. The portions are very generous and the taste is some of the best in Austin. The flavors are rich and authentic. The tortillas are slightly grilled to give it a nice texture. The meats are tender and cooked perfect.  My favorite quick lunch spot 
Juana Taco,49,Although  a lot of food trucks stop at my office building I was always scared to try one and the prices didn t help either.   This was my first food truck experience and it rocked    The food was great  well seasoned and fresh  The owner and crew went above and beyond with awesome customer service   Prices were reasonable and honestly for the amount of great food you get not bad  The green salsa was terrific and spicy  Oh did I mention the tortillas are hand made  Yums 
Juana Taco,50,Awesome tacos and super friendly service   Migas breakfast tacos are awesome. Pretty much everything is homemade by them and the seating area is super clean and nice. James was excellent and so helpful  great start to the day.
Juana Taco,51,Seriously  these are some of the best tacos I ve had in Austin. Again  I can never remember the name of the taco  started with a P   but I ve had a lot of tacos around town over the years and this was one of the best.
Juana Taco,52,Guacamole lacks flavor as well as I received a stingy portion of it to go with a small bag of their homemade chips. The pastor tacos were okay. I don t see why this place has 4.5 stars  there are better taco trucks out there where I ll be taking my service next time.
Juana Taco,53,You can get a much better taco at any taqueria in town  for about half the price.
Juana Taco,54,I moved here from El Paso and it s been a struggle to find authentic tasting tacos. This place knows it s Mexican food. Best bean and cheese taco in Austin hands down. Great salsas.
Juana Taco,55,Tortillas are homemade and delicious. Barbacoa and migas taco was my favorite  in the area I highly recommend.
Juana Taco,56,Do yourself a favor  The Papa Asada is epic. Had to fight a guy off for the last one on the truck. The Panchos look delicious as well. Go get it my friends.
Juana Taco,57,Juana Taco comes to my office twice per week and that s where I ordered from. I got the migas taco which had onions and jalapenos  but I couldn t find them in my taco - it was a taco of egg  cheese  and tortilla chips. The taco was mediocre  the salsa wasn t quite spicy enough for me  but the tortilla was excellent. However  it definitely wasn t worth the wait. It took 30 minutes for 2 basic breakfast tacos  ordered straight off the menu - no substitutions or additions . Juana Taco  maybe consider a grab-and-go option in the future. I won t be coming back.
Juana Taco,58,Great food  but they are consistently late to the lunch hour slot they have at our building. Some times they don t even show up.
Juana Taco,59,I ordered food from their truck yesterday. First of all  the food tasted great. Great value as well. The only problem is  me as well as three other guys I work with got sick after eating the pastor. This is not a common issue with this place. I m guessing that someone made the decision to get rid of product that was about to go bad or did not follow proper food handling procedure that day. It s not my intention to give this business a bad name. I just want to notify the management so this doesn t happen to anyone else.
Juana Taco,60,Best Tacos I have ever had. I ate the Campeche Tacos with Al Pastor Meat and it was delicious and addictive. Truly recommended.
Juana Taco,61,Solid breakfast tacos  always ask for the green sauce. Lunch has a wide variety of good options as well.
Juana Taco,62,Recently had breakfast tacos from here.  The potatoes were cooked but mushy and not browned or crispy.  The bean and cheese taco was very bland  the cheese that was used doesn t have any flavor.  The tacos were very greasy.  Was disappointed and they are a little pricey.  Won t go back.
Juana Taco,63,Super delicious food. Juana Taco parked outside my workplace today and I can t wait for them to come back  I had the elote and a gringa taco. The corn in the elote was super sweet and still had just the right amount of crunch  and mixed with the crema  lime  cotija cheese  and cayenne  Just about the most delicious thing I ve had in a while. The gringa taco - pastor on a flour tortilla with cilantro and lime - was just fantastic. Tortilla was the perfect texture  meat was super-savory - can t say enough good things. Price was also really good. I ll definitely be keeping my eye out for them 
Juana Taco,64,We stopped here for tacos this morning and holy cow were they tasty  I love homemade corn tortillas and these were perfect. My migas taco was enormous  so bring your appetite. Enjoy 
Juana Taco,65,On a recent trip to Austin  I tried Juana Taco s potato  egg and cheese breakfast taco at their 11th Street location. It was a healthy portion and was hot and very tasty. The eating area is welcoming and clean with colorful picnic tables and umbrellas. The service was friendly and the wait wasn t long. It was a super yummy satisfying breakfast. I ll definitely visit again.
Juana Taco,66,The papa asada is GREAT  Elote appetizer is as authentic as you can get here in Austin  they even use white corn   The al pastor is delicious. Portions are huge. Very pleased 
Juana Taco,67,Thanks for suggesting the Papa Asada. Awesome comfort food. Very tasty and fulfilling.
Juana Taco,68,Horrible tacos.  I had two beef fajita tacos. The meat was cold and tough and lacked flavor.  For almost  4 per taco  you re better off going to Taco Cabana.  I refuse to eat here again.
Juana Taco,69,On point  I love when they come to where I work in the Arboretum.
Juana Taco,70,The Pirata taco was really good. One of the best I have had .
Taqueria Montenegro,1,Yes  it s just a counter and tiny waiting area  but the tacos are great and super cheap. I usually go for breakfast tacos  but if I can get there early enough  I love the pastor tacos.  A previous reviewer must have received the wrong taco because their pastor tacos taste nothing like chili powder.  They re pretty quick  but it can be a bit of a wait  no more than 10 minutes  at peak times. While you re waiting  go next door and grab a drink.   Get there early. The sign says they close at 4 00  but there are a lot of times that they close up early  3ish . And cash only. Tax appears to be included in the price. They do not take checks or credit debit cards  but the Texan mart next door has an ATM that only charges  2  cheaper than most bank ATM fees  if you need cash. The Texan Mart also serves ice-cold beer at 7am  M-Sat  for those coming home from a night shift.
Taqueria Montenegro,2,Best Tacos for your Money any day even on Sundays for some good Menudo. BUT C MON Squeeze some lime  a shake of salt  with their Salsa Verde on some Al Pastor  amp  Fajita Tacos finely chopped up con cilantro y cebolla OMG  Ok  i m back for 4 more de maiz por favor 
Taqueria Montenegro,3,I just love this place. I have been getting breakfast tacos here for many years. It has consistently  always  always been super fresh  quick and at a good price. I love ham on tacos for a ham  egg and cheese  and this place has the best. The tortillas super fresh and the corn  what I like  is super soft tacos  prepared perfectly.
Taqueria Montenegro,4,The girl at the cash register was rude and charged me more for my food than the price listed on the menu.  I bought one Egg and Potato and one Bean and Potato breakfast taco.  Each taco was listed as  1.25 on the menu so the total should ve been  2.50.  She charged me  3.  I called her out on it and she first gave me the excuse that I asked for extra salsa. I didn t.  I asked for one salsa for each taco I ordered.  I wouldn t say that s asking for  extra .  After I told her that  she said the Bean and Potato was  1.50  but you can look at the menu and it obviously says  1.25.  I told her that as well and she just reiterated in a rude tone that it was  1.50  even though I pointed out that their menu says differently.  She didn t care.  Even if it was  1.50  the total should ve been  2.75 and not  3.  I was planning to tip beforehand anyways so I didn t lose any extra money overall but I won t be going here again due to the rude customer service and them not honoring their prices on the menu.  The food was fine but nothing special compared other taquerias in the area. I wouldn t have minded paying  1.50 for each taco either as long as that s what was listed on the menu  but I felt cheated by this experience.
Taqueria Montenegro,5,This place is amazing  Tacos are delicious  I always get the barbacoa they are delicious  If you are eating some excellent tacos I highly recommend them  My father has tried the other foods and he also had said it s really good  Here is a picture of the menu 
Taqueria Montenegro,6,This spot got the whole intersection of Braker and I-35 smelling like you in Mexico City for real the food is totally  the best Mexican food you can get from any food truck or walk up and order type joint... I was waiting next door for speeycash to open and noticed everyone coming into this little plaza was going into this tiny little Mexican joint and the whole parking lot smelled awesome any way I decided to get a couple of barbacoa and potato tacos...WHEW     I was blown tha f ck away I damn near cashed my check at speeycash and spent the whole damn thing on tacos   
Taqueria Montenegro,7,The best guisada de puerco tacos... sweet people there and inexpensive   1.75   ... I go there at least once a week... for real
Taqueria Montenegro,8,My fav place for beef fajita tacos for the last 15 years. Also love the  1.25 breakfast tacos. They use to be in trailer and earned their way to the brick and mortar.
Taqueria Montenegro,9,WTH   Am I in Mexico  Why am I standing at the counter in this tiny hole in the wall ordering tacos  Dude  how much of that acid did you give me  There is no way their tacos are this cheap  HFS  I should be thinking about how im going to get home from Mexico but this taco is so damn good Im not even stressing  Wait... Im not in Mexico  Im on Braker and 35 next to a haji store  AWESOME
Taqueria Montenegro,10,Best taco s in town    I love the beef fajita tacos. They make it fresh to order  The prices are reasonable compared to a lot of places around town.  1.25 for breakfast tacos and  1.75 for lunch tacos.
Taqueria Montenegro,11,It is what it is. A small to-go taco shop. Everything was as expected. Wait-time was reasonable and the tacos hit the spot. Verde salsa could be a bit spicier.
Taqueria Montenegro,12,Still open for service. Hands down THE BEST tacos in north Austin. The meat is good  the people are friendly  you can call ahead your orders. I love it
Taqueria Montenegro,13,Best breakfast in town for the price  We love getting the breakfast plates and just making our tacos. Love that they take call ins. Tip  cash only 
Taqueria Montenegro,14,I love their barbacoa tacos  with some lime which by the way Im not sure they give them out with your order  and salsa verde. This review is just for the barbacoa tacos since thats the only thing I really order   . Back when they still had their food truck in the parking lot I used to buy their chicken tortas which I loved  but haven t had that in years. Also bough a breakfast taco which was good  no great but okay.  I live close by  so beware of morning and lunch when its really busy. But the nice thing is you can call ahead and order.
Taqueria Montenegro,15,In my continuous search for the best breakfast tacos in Austin  I saw this place had decent enough yelp reviews to give it a shot. First  its a taqueria so I couldn t give a shit about the ambiance. It being cash only and clearly busy with Hispanics on their way to a blue collar job were positive signs. I got a bean  amp  cheese  potato  amp  egg  and a potato  egg  amp  cheese for  4.00 As I ve mentioned in my other breakfast taco reviews it comes down to 4 things  1. Tortilla   3 5  For breakfast tacos  flour is only considered. The tortilla was standard San Antonio size  which is good  bigger than standard Austin size  but def nothing special in the taste department. 2. Filling   4 5  They didn t skimp out on filling just becuase the tortilla was larger than your avg Austin tortilla  which is appreciated. The most imprtant ingredient of a breakfast taco is the egg. Their eggs weren t  watery  nor overcooked  scrambled well  and mixed with the 2nd ingredient nicely. The potatoes were average  didn t stand out at all. The cheese was somewhat disappointing  average quality but not mixed in with the filler...just a melted layer on top of the filling  like on a chili dog. 3. House Salsa  3.5 5  They don t use  tub  salsa and offer a spicier verde tomatillo option which I ll pick every time. That being said  their green salsa isn t anything special when compared to other salsa verdes around town. Meh heat and meh flavor. I d say avg for both. The amount of salsa they give you in their to-go container is well above avg which is nice. 4. Price   4 5  Meets my requirement for being under  2 per  not even Austin s beloved Tacodeli is worth more than  2 per breakfast taco . Any 2 items for  1.25 plus 25  per addiitonal item. This is a good price for Austin  more expensive than avg for San Antonio tho  man I miss those 89  tacos at Ruthie s in the morning . In this area  I d def go here over something like Vazquez s  Pablito s  TCs  Torchy s  or an avg taco truck but would rather get mine from Taquito Anaya  2 exits South - way better quality  amp  salsa tho 25  per more expensive   Cheko s  2 exits South  same price but better quality   Maria s  1 exit North  better quality and cheaper by 50  for 3...tho only till 10am   or Ken s  1 exit South  same quality but better bang for your buck since each taco is enormous with filling . Again this is just about their breakfast tacos  their non-breakfast tacos were priced cheap enough to where I ll come back sometime for lunch to give them a try. Looks like my search continues for Austin s best breakfast taco.
Taqueria Montenegro,16,Taqueria Montenegro is a tiny little hole-in-the-wall taco place next to the Citgo gas station on the north side of Braker Lane  just west of I-35.  I don t have the exact address because I m unable to find it online or in the phone book  but I know it exists because I ate there today.  They must not have a phone  which doesn t really surprise me .  Good tacos  and super  super cheap.  I had an al pastor plate   4.50 .  It was supposed to come with two tacos  beans  and rice  but if you order the corn tortillas  they give you four tortillas - and there is plenty of meat to fill all four.  The al pastor was wonderful - very flavorful  if not a little bit oily  but I like my meat moist    and it comes with aforementioned beans and rice  along with some fried onions  cilantro  and your choice of red or green salsa to round out the mix.  The beans  refried  were also chock full of flavor.  I suspect they aren t vegetarian.  Rice was only so-so - more or less your average Spanish rice - but I was plenty full from eating the other stuff and didn t need it  anyway.  Besides the taco plates  Taqueria Montenegro serves breakfast tacos and some other things that  frankly  are so  authentic  that I couldn t even tell what they were.  I did notice tripe on the menu  so yeah.  Definitely not your typical  Americanized  Tex-Mexian fare  and hooray for that .  No seating.  Just you  a counter  and an amazingly speedy  darn cheap  authentic Mexican meal to go served in a styrofoam container with plasticware.  What s not to love 
Taqueria Montenegro,17,God I miss living next to this place...I would eat lunch here about 3 times a week.  I haven t had better Mexican food in town.   4.50 Al Pastor plate with corn tortillas until I die.  Order your food  go to gas station next door and pick up tasty beverage  come back to pickup food  go home and enjoy that shit while watching Battlestar Galactica on Netflix.  Verily  not a place you would want to bring a date...actually  no fuck that...your date will thank you through mouthfuls of food from behind their styrofoam container and you will probably fall in love forever  their food is that good.
Taqueria Montenegro,18,Authentic  hole-in-the-wall ethnic food totally rocks. Except when it doesn t.  Based on great reviews I hoped Taqueria Montenegro would offer all kinds of mojo. Unfortunately it didn t pan out that way. The place consists solely of a tiny lobby and order window  so the ambiance has all the charm of standing in line to buy a bus pass in a second-world country. The guy at the counter was friendly but it s all about speed and efficiency here so that brief pleasantry can t count for much. Prices are certainly cheap  even for the category. There s something. Now if only the food would redeem... but it doesn t quite manage...  Barbacoa Taco  Best of the three - actually above average for an  ber-cheap taco.  Carne Guisada Taco  Carne guisada isn t the most exciting taco filling  but if it doesn t inspire it should at least comfort. Shrug.  Al Pastor Taco  I really hope they screwed up and gave me the wrong item here. The meat tasted like I was eating chili powder straight from the jar. Grab some chili powder from your pantry. Daub it on your tongue. Yep  that s exactly what it tasted like. For any taco type that s just inexcusably lazy preparation. If it s supposed to be Al Pastor  all the worse.  Salsa Verde  Just standard-issue  immediately-forgettable hot tomatillo stuff.  Meh. Really wanted to like you  Tacqueria Montenegro. Sorry things didn t work out.
Taqueria Montenegro,19,I really love it here especially when I m in a hurry and want something quick to take with me  They should open their own restaurant  the only thing is I wish there hours were longer 
Taqueria Montenegro,20,COUNT YOUR CHANGE.   They short changed me this morning.  Only a dollar... but still. Damnit.   Adding insult to injury  they also messed up the order. Order more than 1 type of breakfast taco  and you can expect a 60  chance of them messing it up.   My last 3 orders came out incorrect. The short changing was the last straw and pushed me to write a review.   This morning  asked for 3 tacos with sausage. What I got was 3 tacos with beans instead. Even though the brown paper bag they came in was labeled correctly.
Taqueria Montenegro,21,I ve been going here since 03 when they were in a truck still.  The chicken quesadilla will blow your freakin mind   The beef  pork  and chicken have the same marinade flavor and it s like no flavor I ve ever tasted anywhere  so good. It actually varies too from time to time  but It s literally one of the only foods I crave. The Verde  green  sauce is also on point as well  again like nothing I ve tasted anywhere else.  The dude in the convenience store next door is a cool cat as well  he s got it all in there.
Taqueria Montenegro,22,You were a small taco truck that coworkers around metric in 2005 would buy from. Youre now a small shop next to a Mideast run convenient store.   Breakfast tacos and some lunch plates at a good price.  The barbacoa torta is one of the best around. And the chicharon quesadilla is haunting me at this moment. That convenient store  must make good money on soft drinks in the early part of day when you re open.
Taqueria Montenegro,23,I m so sad to have to give a bad review to this taco place because for a long time they were my go to place for the best breakfast tacos. Unfortunately  my last taco purchase I found a piece a sharp spiral metal in my taco so I called them and they seemed shocked on the phone so I took my taco back in to the shop right away to show them  I was a regular so they knew me  They just looked at me and said they don t know how that happened  but with the attitude like I was lying. They didn t offer my money back  not that it matters it s only  1.50 or even to offer me another taco. They just stared at me and said  uh sorry . I just walked out and never went back   .
Taqueria Montenegro,24,Wow....this is as good as it gets for a taco stand. Their barbacoa and al pastor is as good as it gets. Prices are great and food quality is unmatched. Only reason it gets 4 stars is for cash only  no surprise  and absolutely zero seating. This also not a big surprise but even a few picnic tables around the parking lot would be a good idea. These are small issues though. If you want good inexpensive tacos  you ll find none better than Taqueria Montenegro.
Taqueria Montenegro,25,The best barbacoa tacos in the state of Texas. I travel all over especially the valley and no one has better barbacoa tacos. No one. I ve never had anything else so I don t know how there other tacos are but again the barbacoa is best in Texas.
Taqueria Montenegro,26,This is a tiny little place wedged in between a Money Box and a Citgo Texan Mart.  The breakfast tacos are cheap and tasty.  I think it used to be a taco cart that upgraded to actual building space  but it s still order at the counter and take it to go.  No seating  limited standing room  and cash only.  Did I mention cheap and tasty tacos 
Taqueria Montenegro,27,Best breakfast tacos in town. They are fast and very cheap  most breakfast tacos are only a buck  although its well worth the extra .25 cents to get some cheese or potatoes added. Their red sauce is amazing  the green sauce is really good too but a bit hot for my taste.  The quesadilla tacos with chicken are a personal favorite. This is a great place to grab breakfast on your way to work or a quick and cheap lunch if you re in North Austin.
Taqueria Montenegro,28,Best authentic taco place in town in my opinion. You cannot beat their Al Pastor Tacos. The place looks like a hole in the wall  but believe me... give it a shot.
Taqueria Montenegro,29,Yooowzers    This taco stand makes a mean and hot  like your mouth burns for an hour   salsa verde. Good thing for me I like my salsa spicy. My coworker treated us to the tacos so I m not sure about the prices  but the potato and egg taco was tasty. I hope she goes back  because it s nowhere near my regular routine- she said it s located at the corner of 35 and Braker.
Taqueria Montenegro,30,Great tacos  The verde sauce is the better of the two choices but the red is still awesome. The best price for tacos in town 
Taqueria Montenegro,31,I love this place.  I ve been coming here since 2002  when they were only a taco truck  because I just love their breakfast tacos.  The green salsa is the best I ve ever had  hot hot hot   and the red is also quite tasty.  Yum 
Taqueria Montenegro,32,OH yeah   This is my Friday morning stop. This is on my way to work at Braker Ln near 35 on the NW corner next to the Citgo and Money Box. I always buy the office breakfast tacos from here on Fridays. Great salsas either red or green  I like the green myself. They are so good and cheap  1.00  .25 if you want something extra like cheese. I love that they bought the space where the old Money Box was because some mornings it is hella cold and windy because of the interstate  I sure don t miss that old taco truck they had.
Taqueria Montenegro,33,Super good tortas al pastor and barbacoa tacos   Order for pick up because its a hole in the wall with no sitting. Their food is our saturday or Sunday breakfast or sometimes both days...yes they re that good and cheap 
Chicken Bowl,1,Be it ever so humble   There s no place like home.  And if you have been running around vacationing like I have   Eating the wonderful but weird foods of the exotic nations of the world   It is still good to come back to Austin.  And what is the first thing you do when you come back to Austin   Go for Tex-Mex of course          Chicken Bowl does a fine Tex-Mex.  They are a breakfast and lunch place that kind of sort of serves south of Campus and north of the Capitol.  But they get a lot of customers from wherever they get them.  The Tex-Mex here is pleasant  serviceable and comforting.  I had their migas rancheros.  a  These were spicy migas.  This was not your standard Austin -  Make scrambled eggs - toss Denver omelet ingredients into it -  Add some jalapenos and pretend you have migas.  This had plenty of fire because  a1  They had a ton of jalapenos in the eggs  a2  There was some source of hot sauce in the eggs too.  Cholula   Victoria   Who knows   But it meant that every bite commanded respect.  b  They cook their refried beans with industrial quantities of garlic salt - or maybe garlic power and regular salt.         I hereby announce officially to all of Yelp -   In my Ordained Capacity as a Yelp Reviewer that  Garlic Salt   or If You Will  Garlic Powder and Regular Salt  Are Absolutely First Rate Things To Put In Refried Beans.  I Hereby Certify These Beans To Be Excellent.         Chicken Bowl has a huge huge menu.  Not everything is Tex Mex.  You can go Teriyaki if you like.  They have vegetarian things for the healthy eaters in your circle.  This is NOT what you call a destination restaurant.  But you work in the neighborhood   This makes a great breakfast place or a great lunch place.         If these folks were anywhere near my office    I would eat here a lot.                     After I wrote this review   I looked at the other Yelp reviews.  A lot of people agree with me.  Some don t.  General Note   The complainers get their food to go and don t eat in the restaurant.  This kind of food degenerates with travel.  Also - the teriyaki seems to be getting negative votes.  Fair Enough.  The Complainers are raising legitimate points.  So what should you do   1  Eat in the restaurant and do not get your food to go.  2  Eat Tex-Mex and not Pan-Asian.  You will then join the happy people having happy times.  Happy times are good times.
Chicken Bowl,2,The food was excellent  I had tostadas  and they were delicious. My husband had the chicken teriyaki bowl  and he loved it   And.....  the customer service was incredible 
Chicken Bowl,3,Had a great quick lunch today 2 tacos - fajita and shredded chicken.  Yummy with great sauce.  Friendly and helpful staff.
Chicken Bowl,4,Enjoyed a generous and freshly made mexican omelette which I had customized to my preferences.  The refried beans did not have much flavor and their breakfast potatoes needed salt-easily rectified. The service was friendly  fast and thoughtful. I will definitely return to this spot.
Chicken Bowl,5,This down town restaurant shop does such great food despite it being a small place the food is mi fly Quick depending on their business days  but mostly when I come it s always packed with customers . My favorite plate here is the green chilaquiles and the fresh chips and salsa as a starter   I really love their service towards customers   really nice and out going . do recommend for breakfast    
Chicken Bowl,6,Great quick breakfast or lunch spot. The restaurant has been in business for 25 years and luckily survived the pandemic loss of the office crowd. I like to go here because I can get a healthy chicken bowl and a large to-go tea at a reasonable cost. The restaurant also has beer.
Chicken Bowl,7,I came in during a Wednesday around 1 00. I ordered the chicken bowl  and they had it ready within 2 minutes. I walked back to work and I opened up my meal to find this  All of the components for a chicken bowl are there but the chicken was dry  and gritty  Overly salty. No teriyaki sauce that I could see anywhere. They should just stick to making Tex-Amex if the bar is this low.
Chicken Bowl,8,I don t know how this place is open serving such bland food. My friends picked up a chicken teriyaki bowl for me.  That was mistake  1  This was my first and last time eating food from here. This plate of food was so BLAND and questioned why would everyone eat this stuff    . No seasoning at all  The chicken looked and tasted like boiled chicken throw on the plate. How can you call something teriyaki and it looks like this    I even paid extra for the fried rice... just don t. And the vegetables were overcooked mush. While folks rave about the tacos... this bowl was totally inedible.  If Mexican food is what u do best  stick to that. Just don t do it to yourself. Don t get this bowl.
Chicken Bowl,9,I left this place feeling confused. I saw the restaurant walls lined with awards  news clippings  and articles boasting its amazingess   . While it is downtown  I still feel like this place is a bit above average in terms of cost.  My food  which I believe was a combination plate was pretty standard. I was pretty let down  especially being hyped from all the awards that surrounded me. Overall  I would probably give this place a pass as the price doesn t align with the food or restaurant scale.  Upside is that the staff is extremely nice and its in walking distance with lots around in its area of downtown Austin.
Chicken Bowl,10,Such a friendly place  the owner make wverything fresh from scratch. Authentic Mexican flare. Right next door to Thundercloud Subs in case you miss the Chicken Bowl sign.
Chicken Bowl,11,Great coffee and breakfast and tacos  We had eggs  spinach  cilantro  and avocado tacos. They were great 
Chicken Bowl,12,Great food  service  and hospitality. Certainly deserving of a five star rating. Really hope that hours get expanded to the weekends too but it s totally ok.   I was strolling around down town looking for some good food to eat when i see this restaurant called The Chicken Bowl. I decide to give it a shot and went in. Immediately I become surrounded by this wave of the amazing fresh smell of good  cooking food and the sound of sizzling pans full of goods and people talking. At this moment as my mouth was watering just from walking in the door i thought to myself   if the experience is already this good then i can t wait to see what it all tastes like    I walked up to the register as a friendly voice greets me and asks what I would like to indulge myself in. My eyes wander around the store and finally settle on the menu. I scanned the extensive choice of stunning foods and notice that the taco is just calling for me. I tell Chris  my new friend that is the cashier and the host  that I want a taco with everything on it. He looks at me and asks if it s my first time here and I say yes.  Coming right up   he says as I get a bottle of water.  I sit down at a round table with 4 empty seats  waiting not even 8 minutes before I see that within a brown paper bag lies my food. I open it and a wave of excitement rushes over me. I take the food out of an aluminum foil cover and take a look at the amazing creation that is now in my hands. A true masterpiece it is  I think to myself. I take one bite and very soon after I find myself with empty hands and my taco is completely gone. The taste was something else. I leave the store and have a great day afterwards.
Chicken Bowl,13,Location is the only reason I tried this place  it is very near my work.  It is ok  I don t go out of my way to go there often  but it s a solid option.  Their breakfast tacos are good and cheap.  For lunch I ve tried the teriyaki bowl and the chicken enchiladas.  Both were decent  not great.  But it s 10x better than the El Mercado a block down  so you take what you can get sometimes.  I really like the service  it seems like a Mom and Pop place with lots of regulars  mostly state employees .  And they have Topo Chico.  Update  I had the chicken enchiladas verdes for the second time and they were pretty great.  I ll definitely order those again  4 stars on the chicken enchiladas verdes  but still 3 overall.
Chicken Bowl,14,I love this place  I get breakfast tacos here 2-3 times a week. The staff is incredibly friendly and super quick. You also get a lot of food for a reasonable price. Would definitely recommend for a quick breakfast or lunch.
Chicken Bowl,15,Breakfast tacos are great    Highly recommend bacon  egg  cheese  amp  potato taco    Lunch isn t as good here but I still come from time to time because it s convenient for my work.   You can always count on friendly service from the guy and gal working the front.
Chicken Bowl,16,What you get here is more than what you see and way more than what you spend on it. Get there early for lunch and you can watch the kitchen staff peeling and slicing fresh veggies and cooking up the beans and meat from scratch. If you got a glimpse into almost any other kitchen in the area  excepting Clay Pit  I imagine   what you d see instead is people slicing open and dumping plastic bags of frozen foodstuffs into fryers and pots  along with the contents of industrial-sized cans. Highly processed food isn t good. It isn t even really food  in many important respects. Places like Chicken Bowl that take the time and trouble to cook from scratch deserve a lot of praise  and I am happy to give them my business.  On crazy days I get the flautas  which I love--they beat El Mercado s flautas all to hell.  One time I picked up an El Mercado flauta and a literal river of burning hot oil ran from the flute down the inside of my left forearm. A top ten foul surprise. Which is maybe just what I deserve for eating with my fingers out in public.  Most days I go straight for the teriyaki chicken bowl. The chicken is actually braised in teriyaki-spiced broth  and not sauteed or wok-fried as most teriyaki is. It s moist and lean. Along with the steamed broccoli  carrots  cabbage  and rice that make up this bowl  it s a super healthy lunch. I like to sauce mine up with the Sriracha and house sauce supplied on the table.  For under  10  I consider Chicken Bowl the best lunch option in the veritable lunchtime wasteland known as the Capitol Complex. No matter how busy they are  the guys who work here will always take time after you order to thank you for coming in and to invite you back for another visit. I am happy to take them up on that invitation.
Chicken Bowl,17,I ve been eating here for four years  and this is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. Now  don t set your expectations too high  in fact  lower them even further. This place is no Torchy s Tacos. However  if you are in the Capitol Complex  it s a solid choice.   As long as you don t do something stupid like order the catfish  you re going to have a good time here.
Chicken Bowl,18,Another  it is what it is  review.   Great   Absolutely not.   So  what is it then   It s a decent lunch option if you work one of the nearby state office buildings and want a quick lunch served by a friendly family without having to drive and lose your parking space.  And it s something other than a burger or sandwich.
Chicken Bowl,19,Definitely one of the top 10 home made food restaurants in downtown Austin. Check it out and you won t be disappointed
Chicken Bowl,20,CHICKEN BOWL FOR YA SOUL   A friend of mine took me to The Chicken Bowl AKA Chavero s Restaurant for lunch.  It s family owned and it s a great little breakfast lunch joint in downtown Austin.  If you want some good  cheap TexMex food  this is the place to eat   If you read my rants and raves about going to places to eat during the LUNCH RUSH especially in downtown Austin  I was very surprised that this place  although PACKED TO THE NINES  did not have a long line and table turnover was good.  I went around 12 noon  and I heard that most people order food to go since it s always packed for lunch.    I had the ultra nachos -- beef fajitas with cheese  beans  onions  tomatoes  jalapenos  avocado  and sour cream.  My friend D had his  regular  Teriyaki Bowl.  YES... Michelle C is correct.  This place serves Mexican food and Asian food  bowls .  I really liked the nachos.  It was a good amount  and I ate every single nacho on my plate.  D always takes his bowl TO GO.  I noticed that they gave him a huge amount of food with cabbage and veggies.  They also serve hamburgers  salads  soups  chicken or tortilla    5 different style of nachos  quesadillas  enchiladas  fajitas  chile relleno  tacos  carne guisada  flautas and breakfast items.  They also serve teriyaki bowls -- chicken  beef or veggie and fried rice.  Kind of strange  but it looked pretty healthy and an abundant amount of food.  Seating is inside  none outside.  Drinks are by the can  tea or water.  You order at the counter  and they serve the food to you.  You also have to self serve on the drinks  Overall  the prices are relatively cheap  5-7 smackers per meal  and you cannot beat that for downtown.  I definitely will be eating at this place   Too bad they don t have any BARBACOA   I would ve given them 4-5 stars if they had 
Chicken Bowl,21,While I ve never BEEN to the actual restaurant  The Chicken Bowl sells their breakfast tacos in the lobby of my office during the week. Let me tell you  they are GOOD. Classic  cheap  delicious -- what more do you need  You go  Chicken Bowl.
Chicken Bowl,22,Friendly service  pretty darn good enchiladas  all at a reasonable price point.   Great quick and tasty lunch spot.
Chicken Bowl,23,I LOVE Chicken Bowl    My coworker and I come here at least 2-3 times a week for their breakfast tacos or their migas. Their migas are TO DIE FOR. Seriously the best migas I ve tried besides my mother s. When it comes to their tacos  I m partial to their bean and cheese  their re-fried beans are great   but their barbacoa  chorizo  and bacon and egg are all delicious  as well.   Like a previous poster said  the employees here are very warm and friendly and they remember your order once you ve been in there a a few times  They re also incredibly quick in whipping up your order  it s rare to wait more than 5 minutes for your order to be ready. I ve never actually tried their  Chicken Bowl  but I can say that their breakfast and their lunch enchiladas do NOT disappoint   Give them a try  you won t regret it.  - 
Chicken Bowl,24,I love this spot and it is right next door.  Owner is very friendly and the food is great.  I especially recommend the caldo.  huge slices of veggies in a wonderful broth  and they don t skimp on the chicken.  Very fresh.
Chicken Bowl,25,One word review  A ite  This place is what it is  relatively inexpensive in the CBD  Central business district  downtown.  I get breakfast tacos that are okay and relatively cheap and they are open before 8am  which allows me to grab something on my way to the office.  There always seem to be officers in here  maybe they get a good discount or it could be the proximity to several state and federal buildings.    If you wanna save your dough  give it a go.
Chicken Bowl,26,Haven t been here for lunch but their breakfast tacos are bomb -salsa is good too. Really great customer service 
Chicken Bowl,27,This place is awesome. I was working nearby back in the day and craved  CRAVED their bean and cheese tacos and breakfast tacos. Went there every day for breakfast and was never disappointed. Friendly service  quick and delicious.
Chicken Bowl,28,I LOVE their breakfast tacos   The tortillas and salsa are always on point.  I always get their migas taco and potato  egg  and cheese taco - They are stuffed full of ingredients.  Plus  super friendly staff every single time.  I love starting a Friday morning here.
Chicken Bowl,29,Okay  Chicken Bowl - it took you a little over 4 years  absolute proximity to my workplace  and me finding the right menu item  but you finally won me over.  Let me first say that the concept of Asian  Tex-Mex  and American food  not fusion  mind you  is delivered preposterously.  But this place is always busy  and I figured out why.  Stay away from the Am-Mex and hit the beef teriyaki bowl.    For  6 something  you get tasty marinated teriyaki strips over steamed rice and super simple  but wholesome  steamed carrot  broccoli  and cabbage to balance out the salty deliciousness of the teriyaki.  They offer a spicy sauce add on  which has varied widely and strangely in consistency  yet I still consider it a staple.  Nice people run the place  and I ve got a go-to  reasonably healthy  lunch option.  Bam 
Chicken Bowl,30,Great breakfast and reasonable prices. Highly recommend 
Chicken Bowl,31,Slowest service ever. We sat for over 20 minutes for 2 tacos while 6 people that worked here fumbled around the kitchen. Won t return.
Chicken Bowl,32,These people picked the best location ever  I guess  because they aren t that good  but they re really busy anyway.  Despite the crowd  I have gotten my food and a table pretty quickly when I ve eaten here.  The fajita chicken salad is pretty ordinary  but not bad  and more than I could eat.  The enchiladas were actually quite good  and cheap .  The chicken bowls seem unwholesome somehow.  I don t know what it is about them  but I probably won t order one again.
Chicken Bowl,33,The teriyaki  bowls are good.  If I had to pick I would definitely hit them up for breakfast instead of lunch.  It is way more affordable and the chorizo and bean taco is soon to be named after me.  Their migas and huevos rancheros are really good.  Friendly service but be prepared to wait a bit because the tacos are made to order.  A lot of state employees frequent the place so it gets rowdy at times.    Totally kidding.  State workers wait until happy hour to get curreyy-zee.  I believe they also own Dario s and the newest addition is... I forget the name but it s on the I-35 frontage road and Slaughter right by the home depot.
Chicken Bowl,34,One of the best things about my job is that we have employees who pick up lunches for our office from a different place every day.  There are a couple of Thundercloud Subs fans in our office and there is one right up the street from us  so that s one of the more common places in our rotation.  I m not a Thundercloud fan  so on those days  I beg said employee to make a trip next door to the Chicken Bowl.  Great quality food this is not.  But if you want a quick  cheap  Asian-ish or Mexican-ish meal  yes  they carry both  that tastes pretty decent  it fits the bill.  I usually get the  chicken bowl  itself  which is on the Asian-ish part of their menu - it features chunks of chicken  mostly dark meat   some vegetables  usually predominantly cabbage and carrots   and some rice.  I generally promptly smother it with a healthy serving of the sriracha sauce I keep in my desk drawer - voila .  Not a bad meal at all  cheap  and plenty filling.
Chicken Bowl,35,This may not be a five star eatery but seriously... it s one of THE best hole in wall joints smackdab in the middle of UT and the Capitol  The service is fast  the tables are clean and the food is great    Now I haven t tried everything on the menu. One day I tried the carne guisada dink and now I don t want anything else  But I have to tell you about the dink  it may make you feel guilty afterwards  but that guilt never enters your mind while it s in front of you  It is FULL of flavor  a lot of meat  rice and cheese. It s taste is sincerely authentic. The dinks are definitely a safe way to go  However  everything from their enchiladas to their teriyaki bowls are all delicious    Definitely give it a try. The prices are about average   5- 7 a plate. Parking is difficult  so if you can walk  walk. I have yet to meet anyone who was displeased with their experience.   Enjoy 
Chicken Bowl,36,This hole in the wall is just a half block away from my place of employment so it s convenient. I ve only tried their beef enchiladas  works nachos  Dink special  and Chile Relleno.  The enchiladas  and Carne Guisada Dink plate were actually pretty good but their nachos and Chile Rellenos are just ordinary. When I don t feel like walking very much or am in a hurry this place will save the day.
Chicken Bowl,37,I absolutely LOVE this hole in the wall place   There are so many good things here  My favorite is the beef bowl  The hamburger and homemade french fries are really good too  The enchiladas are delicious they use the good cheese  Nachos  caldo and the tortilla soup are also great  I go so often they call me by name  The service is on point. I wish they had more locations 
Chicken Bowl,38,Chicken Bowl is a great place for quick  inexpensive  not to mention DELICIOUS authentic migas in the morning. They have a friendly staff who will actually remember your favorite order if you re a somewhat regular patron. The restaurant has a nice  relaxed atmosphere and the big screen on the wall makes the place feel home-y. This is definitely my new fave  fast food  location in the area.
Chicken Bowl,39,A cup o  strong joe and two pretty decent  quick  fresh breakfast tacos for  5.   SOLD.
Chicken Bowl,40,I work one minute from this place so I visit often for breakfast and lunch. The breakfast tacos are authentic and very delicious. The family is so courteous and nice everytime I walk in.
Chicken Bowl,41,Best cheeseburger I ever had  Loved the food  but most important loved the service  Everyone who works at Chicken Bowl is incredibly nice  incredibly friendly  and make incredibly good food. Keep it up guys      
Chicken Bowl,42,I only come here for the enchiladas. Everything else is ok  but a quick lunch spot never hurts. And man are they busy at lunch  you should try and get here at or before 11 30. They also have  to-go  which is a great option. You can find a bench somewhere close and people watch for your lunch break 
Chicken Bowl,43,Avoid. I could make better tacos at home  and I don t even cook. American cheese on a taco should be a crime   9 for three sad  tacos   microscopic portions of rice and beans  and a soda. Sad. Redeeming factors  friendly employees and great salsa.
Chicken Bowl,44,I was here picking up breakfast tacos  shocker  the other day as they prepared for lunch and discovered that they deep-fry tortillas for fresh lunch dinner tacos.  That seems pretty cool  and makes me want to try them.
Chicken Bowl,45,I ve been coming here since 2000  and their quality and flavor have been consistent.  They have great lunch specials.  They offer hamburgers  baked potatoes  rice bowls  and tex-mex.  Everything on the menu is great   I love their enchiladas - they re the best in town   So are their carne guisada tacos and chicken fajita tacos... they toast the tortilla a bit which I love.  This is also a great place to come for a big bowl of caldo or chicken tortilla soup on a cold day or when you re not feeling well. They recently acquired a TV which is usually set to ESPN.  They are not open past 3 pm.  The man at the counter is the nicest and such a gentleman  even sharing beers with us and staying open later than usual for us to chill and watch World Cup Soccer.
Chicken Bowl,46,I work next door  and need somewhere to get my breakfast taco fix. and this place does the job. and they have the BEST ice tea around..... just never been a fan of the lunch though.
Chicken Bowl,47,Service is fast  food is seasoned well  price is reasonable - what more can you ask for   I am a big fan of their chicken bowl and their cheese enchiladas. One has the veggies for the heart and the other has the flavor for the soul.
Chicken Bowl,48,Today was the first time I d been to the Chicken Bowl and I am so glad my co-worker referred me. The green chicken enchiladas were excellent   The rice and beans were great too. They have quick and friendly service. I met the cook and she is awesome.  I knew her from another favorite restaurant and she remembered me and what I use to order there.  I will definitely come again 
Chicken Bowl,49,Not good  but not bad either. I work nearby and almost never go here. When I do  it s because I m sick  forgot to bring my lunch  and need some good chicken soup. Their chicken soup is home-made and tasty. Limited menu  family owned vibe. If you re in the area you could do worse than the Chicken Bowl. This is a popular breakfast place and if you must have authentic breakfast tacos  barbacoa or carne guisada  this is the only place that serves it nearby. The nearby Arturos  however  has a better tex-mex variety of breakfast options and much better coffee.
Chicken Bowl,50,If you re hungry  don t eat here   Food is actually pretty good but their plates are VERY skimpy and not cheap.
Polvo's DT,1,Came here and fast seating  not even 10 min passed with 6 people we got a table. Ordered  Cantarito  well served 10 10. Food  Oh man  so flavorful and reasonable potions and price. Services very helpful and kind. I loved it. The atmosphere was also great. Super surprised how great everything it was. 10 10 thank you 
Polvo's DT,2,Like many other reviewers  I had my credit card mischarged  twice   after dining here once.  The manager insisted on refunding via Venmo rather than canceling the transaction  which suggests to me that they are trying to hide the frequency of this issue from their payment processors.  We actually had two issues  1. They increased our tip by an extra few dollars. Fortunately I took a photo of the original receipt. 2. They randomly charged our card  50 two days later.  Food was fine  but I m avoiding until management changes.
Polvo's DT,3,Came in around 11 am on a Friday with a party of 6 and was seated immediately. Loved that they have a serve your own salsa bar with many options. We tried the queso which to my surprise was served with a scoop of guacamole and ground beef on the side. It was delicious when mixed together. I had a watermelon margarita  which I did not care for at all. It was definitely fake watermelon flavoring as opposed to fresh. I did try a sip of a Paloma which was very good. We ordered the Goliath burrito  cerveza fajitas  and a taco enchilada combo plate. Some friends that I was with said that the cerveza fajitas are their favorite of any Mexican restaurant  but this time when they ordered them  they came with pieces of sausage  and less beef. It evidently was just beef in the past  so they were pretty bummed. The restaurant interior was pretty and service was good.
Polvo's DT,4,My girlfriend and I are huge polvos fans and are basically regulars at the south location. We were very disappointed to pull up to find not just one location closed but both after we checked the times on google. We drove around trying to find an open location at 10pm to find out both were closed after we also called and asked for the wait time.
Polvo's DT,5,Currently here right now for my birthday. We got here and they sat us down  gave us chips and water and didn t explain that salsa was self served. They then didn t come to our table for about 15 minutes and we had to go in and ask for service while they were dancing around and talking to each other. We then got our food without silverware. Worse experience I ve had. One of my friends who was here also waited at the bar for 5 mins with no one to help him even though they were all standing around. They ran out of rice at a Mexican restaurant    Food was mid without the rice. Only good thing I could say is JAKE attended to us very well after realizing his team was failing to do so since they were too busy on there phones and dancing. Lastly whoever s on aux playing music needs to make up there mind and quit skipping songs 30 secs in.
Polvo's DT,6,PSA  WORKERS ARE RUDE AND YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE A RESERVATION HERE  This employee is completely disrespectful. He yells and laughs at customers. My party made a 2 week in advance  reservation he disregarded it and just sat people freely. When I went up to tell him that we were extremely upset  like any customer would be  he yelled in my face and was completely insensitive and smirking the entire time. The management shouldn t be freely seating people when there s a reservation. Any restaurant I ve ever been to has never done this. This is so unprofessional and my entire party and I will never be back at this location if they continue to keep such rude staff.
Polvo's DT,7,Came here on a Saturday and sat on the patio. Enjoyed some spicy margaritas which were really good  and ordered shrimp ceviche which was subpar. Let s be real  it was bad.   The 1 star review comes from the insane  sporadic behavior by one of the male workers. I went to the ladies room to use the restroom and while washing my hands  a male worker opens the door without knocking and says I need to leave the bathroom so he can clean it. I asked if I could simply wash my hands and he gave me a dirty look. The fact that he felt comfortable enough to open a female restroom without knocking made me feel unsafe and like he was hoping to catch someone in a vulnerable moment. Whether it was his intention or not  the manner in which he burst in left me not only uncomfortable but pissed off. Truly would not recommend and I hope management trains their male employees to respect the female restroom.
Polvo's DT,8,Garbage. We were a party of four on a Sunday. The waitress said the kitchen lost our ticket. Hmmm. Walked out. Don t bother wasting your time.
Polvo's DT,9,Be careful - these guys add on additional charges to your credit card   I went to Polvo s Downtown Central location with five other colleagues for dinner. It was a pretty good ambience and food was fine. They brought the check with tip already added. No big deal - I paid with my card and we all left. Later  when I was filling in my expense report  I saw that they had overcharged my card. That s not cool. I called and spoke with a person named Oscar there. Hopefully he is able to resolve the issue. But frankly  it s not even the extra amount that s an issue  it s the sneakiness that bothers me the most. Double and triple check your credit card statement a few days after you eat here.
Polvo's DT,10,Polvo s Downtown has a nice ambiance. The quality of the food does not reflect the high prices and the wait was a bit long after our order was placed. The best part was the salsa bar. I am a big fan of tex-mex but with the mix of downtown prices I didn t think it was worth it. Our waiting staff was awesome and helpful so it made the experience a bit better 
Polvo's DT,11,I actually really enjoy their food  but it s not worth the absolute hell that is it to get said food  long wait times  abysmal service  - only to end up being told your check cannot be split  no matter how small or large your party is. For a place filled with tables that seat 10  people  you d think they would be prepared to split a few checks...
Polvo's DT,12,Finally homemade tortillas     Decided to try polvos for a late lunch early dinner and it was so worth it.  This is definitely the time to come  No wait and great service.  Food was great and the salsa bar is the best.  Homemade tortillas was the icing on the cake.  Love it 
Polvo's DT,13,We were a larger  walk-in party that was accommodated quickly. We loved the self-serve salsa  amp  were given generous amounts of chips throughout our visit. Despite the restaurants POS service being down  they already had a resolution to continue our dine-in experience.  However  beyond that the service was not great unfortunately.   As the POS issue was resolved  we all order individually. As I had to leave early  I asked to pay for my food  amp  was informed that the bill must be split a minimum of 4 ways. We all ordered very differently  amp  scrambled to figure out who would cover whom.
Polvo's DT,14,I would have posted yesterday  but was feeling I ll after eating at Polvo.  Have not been back for several years. Was Seated at the bar and waited for someone to clear to plates  utensils  and clean the bar. After several minutes  they recognize we were seated. The staff did not clean the the plates  glassware and glasses. To our left and right on the bar were used plates  glasses and unclean counters. Finally ordered. Took over 20 minutes to receive our food. The chicken quesadilla were cold  lacked any flavor.   The enchiladas plate I ordered was cold  lacked flavor. Did I see our waitress   No. Only item good to eat were the tortilla chips. Another 10 minutes passed  we had to request our check. My tip was. No tip for poor quality food and poor staff and service. Many great restaurants in ATX. Forget Polvo.
Polvo's DT,15,Polvos was a fun spot for 10 of us to stop by before we went to a comedy show downtown.  Their all you can eat salsa bar was the highlight of the night.  We also each ordered an entree as well as a few pitchers of margaritas and ended up having to crawl out of there  their entrees were HUGE .  As I mentioned before  I really liked their all you can eat salsa bar.  The pickled veggies were really good  as was the avocado salsa.  For my entree  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with poblano sauce.  I thought these were pretty good  nothing special  but not bad either.  I also ordered some chorizo queso and thought this was really good.  I would definitely get that again.  I tried a bite of my friend s mole enchiladas and I thought these were better than the poblano sauce.  All in all  Polvos is a fun place to eat dinner at with a big group.  I would try the place in South Austin over the DT one but either is a good spot when you need to find a place for a large group last minute.
Polvo's DT,16,As I m waiting 15 minutes for my check with an empty restaurant lemme go ahead and share my experience. The worst salsa that has ever touched my palette. The salsa and food quality was worse than Taco Bell by a mile. Margaritas tasted like they were mixed by a three year old i honestly can t say if there was actual tequila in them. And i got to see my server twice in the hour we were here. Do not waste your time here. I wouldn t come back if they paid me. The best part of my experience was when i left and knew i never had to step foot in there again.
Polvo's DT,17,Really small portion size and they use really awful sauces. My food was almost inedible.
Polvo's DT,18,I was about to embark on a long walk to Zilker on a hot  humid day and stopped here to fuel up before I passed out on my walk. We were seated promptly and our server was wonderful. We happened to make it in time for happy hour which isn t all that special. The  deals  include  5 off a pitcher of margs a couple of bucks of their guac.   We opted to get the pitcher of their classic house marg  the only one that gives you a happy hour discount   the guac  and enchilladas dona clara. The drinks didn t have enough alcohol in them and the guacamole tasted a little off but the enchilladas were good  The portion was massive and we were super grateful that we had decided to split it because it is A LOT for one person. There is a self-serve salsa bar inside consisting of 4 different sauces. The red ones were weirdly sweet and I would pass on those but the others were nice.   Overall  the food was okay and did the job but it wasn t anything to write home about
Polvo's DT,19,This is my first one-star review on Yelp. I ate there with a group and had to foot the bill alone. They included the tip already  and I left a generous 28  tip because I did not see that. When I called the next day  the manager refused to reimburse any of the tip and was also incredibly rude on the phone. Their service was terrible and the food was dry. Would strongly recommend eating at another establishment in downtown Austin.
Polvo's DT,20,SLOOOOOOWEST SERVICE EVERRRRR    We were seated  a basket of chips was put in the table and that was all. 15 minutes later  really  we saw a gentleman walking past and asked him if we could order drinks and salsa. He directed us to the self serve salsa bar and said he would get a server. Server showed up quickly and we ordered drinks which arrived at a very reasonable time.  We ordered 6 street tacos. 3 chicken and 3 al pastor. The al pastor was inedible. Dry and burnt. Salsa didn t even revive it. The chicken had a good flavor  but was also dry.  After requesting the check  we finally received it after another 15 minute wait. Never again. I do not recommend this place.
Polvo's DT,21,Delicious food     Drinks were good-took a min to get our drinks. Although no pricing on the menus for the drinks. Just hope they don t charge you an arm leg for a simple cocktail. V loud in the restaurant. Hard to have a decent convo w o yelling. Waitress was NOT great  Only checked in once  amp  when it was time to collect her tip. We had to depend on the bus guys to give us refills  food  napkins etc LAST BUT NOT LEAST- they put all the utensils in one big gray bin -then pour water  not sure if it was hot or cold  and place them in napkins serving towels  and roll. The salsa bowls that were at the salsa bar were sitting in dirty water. I had to show the bus guy they had to be replaced. He apologized and did so.
Polvo's DT,22,Had the pork tamale and shrimp tacos. Both are fantastic. The tamale was served with a mole sauce that was out of this world  Got an extra tamale to have for breakfast. Best tamales I ve ever had. Also enjoyed a watermelon blended margarita and it was refreshing. Great place for groups since they sell margaritas by the pitcher
Polvo's DT,23,Nothing like Polvos South  environment wise  but just as good  food wise. Went on a Friday night and it was definitely more of a party scene. Busy but we were able to grab a spot at the busy bar and order food and drinks. The drinks seemed pricier than they should have been  but the bartender was friendly and attentive. Food came out quick and was really good 
Polvo's DT,24,Very expensive. Terrible service. We had to argue with the waitress because they wanted to overcharge us. We don t recommend this restaurant.
Polvo's DT,25,We went to Polvos for lunch. We were sat right away and our waitress was amazing. We were able to order pitcher of margaritas   queso and help ourselves to the salsa bar. The fajitas were the perfect amount the share for food. Parking can be tough  but highly recommend Polvos DT 
Polvo's DT,26,Sat us an hour late not a single apology. Didn t comp anything and not sympathetic at all
Polvo's DT,27,Polvos has recently renovated their outdoor patio. It is very swanky and would highly recommend dining at there downtown location.
Polvo's DT,28,Would definitely recommend this place for the food  but the experience overall seemed overwhelming.   Food  wonderful  can t say enough good things  The chips and salsa that they bring to the table are worthy of 2-3 rounds. The food is moderate to expensive in price but the portions are LARGE. 10 10 recommend the chorizo queso and the chicken chili relleno. The sauce on the chili relleno is super unique and something I would go out of my way for.   Experience  now the experience is unfortunately what made me take a star off  there was a bit of a wait  but in the restaurants defense they got us in about 20 min sooner than estimated  but the tables were jam packed with VERY LITTLE covid precaution. On top of that the music  although upbeat and fun  was EXTREMELY loud  it was hard to hear the person sitting directly next to me and all of us left with our ears ringing.
Polvo's DT,29,So good   I love the outdoor patio and the whole vibe. The food was good and the service was GREAT  It s perfect for a nice long dinner 
Polvo's DT,30,We made a reservation for 10 people on a Saturday at 8 15pm for a friends birthday and I have NEVER seen such a disorganized restaurant. Using pen and paper for reservations  no management in sight  at around 9pm the hostess even told us we would be better off if we left and went somewhere else. Polvo needs new management or even management in general. Do better.
Polvo's DT,31,On my last visit to Polvo s I had a horrible experience lol. Our server from the very beginning seemed not too thrill to be taking our order  constantly missing our items  got all of our orders wrong someway  it was a table of 3  and just overall having a bad attitude. We were sitting outside until we saw mice running around at the tables outside  yes you read that right MICE. We went inside and explained her the situation and all she said was  oh okay .
Polvo's DT,32,Polvos is a small business  that packs a punch with flavor.  This gem is nestled at the end of 3rd street but is worth the find. I ate the fish fajitas and had a Mexican martini.  Both were very tasty.  The place is not new so it s got a quaint feel  we sat on the patio   which was enclosed but cold.  Service was good   but slow.  Don t let that discourage you  the food is pretty close to authentic.
Polvo's DT,33,Always amazing food  amp  drinks. Our server Ashley was handling several tables  most of them big parties  and still kept our customer service as her top priority. Thank you so much  Ashley 
Polvo's DT,34,Honestly  I d only come back for the margarita pitchers. We got two frozen pitchers for the table which we knocked out. The drinks were strong and tasted great. The food tasted good too but was overpriced which was alright if you were eating indoors or on the nicer side of the outdoors. The front side in which we sat were foldable tables that weren t covered. That kinda was unfortunate since it started to rain on us. It staff forgot about us a few times too which I had to go into the restaurant to ask for plates  utensils  and water 
Polvo's DT,35,Sat for fifteen minutes waiting for someone to come around and take my order. I was dying of thirst and no one would stop to fucking serve me.  The food was absolutely disgusting.  I had to send BOTH dishes back.  I left there fucking starving.
Polvo's DT,36,If I could give less stars I would.  We when here for a friends celebration  our food took over an hour and a half with the exception of 3 meals- the fajitas. They came out nearly an hour past everyone else s food. I wish this is where the complaint stopped - I reach out to a manager to explain what s happened. He not once apologized  he tried to blame his waitress who was stood right behind him and was totally amazing  then his staff. He lied and told me there was no other manager where the waitress showed me the owner was sat at the bar with several beers in front of him. quoting the manager when I approached the owner and said your waitress pointed me here  oh shit . The manager refused to comp the meals  did not apologize and the only thing he repeated over and over was I m only a half owner  I will not give you meals compensated  it s not my fault the food came out late.  The worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life    Should add our bill was 500   we were not asking for a free meal but for at least the food we did not eat to not be charged.  April 2022
Polvo's DT,37,Wow  I have been to the Polvo s near SoCo but Polvo s DT is a whole different experience you have to partake   I came here late after ACL one evening as I walked back to EA with some friends. We stopped in as it was open and we sat for some drinks.  It is a whole different Polvo s. It is a fancy modern version that takes on a DT feel. I like it as I find myself seeing many businesses doing a chain feel where as this is more personal and unique.  The drinks were fantastic of course nothing shocking there and the salsa bar is prettier. Chips I believe are different than SoCo but I couldn t exactly recall. I did like them for sure but that stuck in head to visit the other soon.  I plan to eat dinner here soon and the outside seating will serve well when it wasn t as hot as it was that evening.  Check it out and don t forget their Mexican Martinis 
Polvo's DT,38,Our friends took us to Polvo s while we were in town visiting and I would definitely recommend  The food was amazing and the portions are huge. I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas with red sauce. The frozen margaritas are also a must try 
Polvo's DT,39,The food was decent but the margaritas were amazing. All the cocktails were super cheap for the quantity and quality of them.
Polvo's DT,40,Gisado de puerco. Spicy margarita. Must try. Nice vibe outside. Fajitas were good to but if you like pork with green sauce do the Gisado de puerco.
Polvo's DT,41,Polvos always stands apart from the crowd  but even more so apparently in this COVID season.  We ordered from this gem last weekend and they killed it   The food tasted fresh  was packaged perfectly with no mistakes or  skimping   and even made for great leftovers the next day.  I just might order from here every weekend going forward  Everyone go support them and keep this Mexican joint in business 
Polvo's DT,42,Decent food but be warned  they do not split checks so this is NOT a place for large parties. We weren t told this until after we had eaten and were ready to pay which was very difficult for a party of 20. Could have been told this on the phone when I made the reservation  when we sat down  and even before we ordered so that s a bit upsetting that a restaurant in the day and age cannot separate checks not inform the guests they cannot.   Molly our server was great other than that.   The beef fajitas were 3.5 5. The beef was okay but when mixed with the entire platter  it tasted great. Tortillas were good too. They have bottomless salsa however it s 3.99 person.
Polvo's DT,43,Terrible service. But two stars for the margs and queso. Definitely recommend the south location over the DT. The food is better and the overall service is WAY better.
Polvo's DT,44,Solid Mexican food. There are a lot of options in Austin  so plenty to choose from. This place won t let you down 
Polvo's DT,45,Jose Pavel   the manager who told us his name was Diego and Manuel put illegitimate charges on out bill and refused to fix it. He instead told us to TAKE IT OUT OF THE TIP. FOR THE SERVER. And he reeked of alcohol. Completely unprofessional.   Also  there were other tables trying to dispute false charges at the same time of us. They are scamming customers.
Polvo's DT,46,I went here for my friends birthday- we waited 1hr 15mins to get our margaritas- as countless walk in customers received their margs  we did not. We then heard from our waitress that the drink we asked for  house margarita  was  out . We wondered why that was something they didn t tell us right of the bay.....Manuel Martinez - the manager said this was normal...so I d you d like to wait for drinks for over an hours- come here....  Update  the manager lied to us - Jose pavel - he was non accommodating and a terrible manager.
Polvo's DT,47,I live in the building above the downtown Polvos and they constantly play their exterior music at a sound level as if the were a club. Complete disregard for the people living above them. Sometimes they turn it all the way up on Sunday mornings when they are in the process of opening  not even open for business yet. Do not give your business to a restaurant who does not respect their community.
Polvo's DT,48,The food is decent but the service is by far some of the worst in Austin. They do not honor reservations or have any clue what is going on. Would highly recommend finding anywhere else to get Mexican food as this is far from the best.
Polvo's DT,49,Polvo s is an Austin staple. The margaritas are amazing  and lethal  in a good way  and the fajitas are the best in town  A great place to take out of town guests  especially the downtown location. It s walkable to most places downtown  which makes it even better  Every great night starts at Polvos 
Polvo's DT,50,Went in while at a trip in Austin. Ordered the combo fajita plate with beef and veggies. The beef was very well seasoned and tender and the veggies where amazing. I was surprised with the variety of veggies that where provided usually you only get bell peppers and onions. They served it with spinach  zucchini  corn  onions  peppers  and mushrooms...we ordered a pitcher of margs which yields about 6 servings. I m not the biggest marg lover but these where good. Overall we enjoyed our lunch in their breezy patio. Their AC was out but ehhh that happens. Salsa bar was bom too.
Polvo's DT,51,Worst service ever. Chili Con Queso was like water very runny with no flavor.  Wait staff inattentive  we had to beg for water refills.  No flavor to the food whatsoever.  Who manages this place  Whoever they are they need to be fired immediately   because they have their head up their ass.  It s Tuesday March 1 2022 at 7 pm.    You have been warned about this place  enter and eat at your own risk.  P.S.- loud crappy music through crap speakers. The only thing missing is food poisoning   I ll report back on that. Read the other reviews and see the pattern of bad service  bad food  and bad music.  If hell serves Mexican food Polvo s will  be there next to the Taco Bell  if unfortunately you re there  I ll be at the Taco Bell come say hi .
Polvo's DT,52,My Favorite Mexican Restaurant in Austin Texas.  Growing up in Texas over these years I ve been to many Mexican Restaurants and this is  MY absolute favorite. T  Enchiladas made with a sauce that combines Chile Peppers and Chocolate Sauce from a recipe originating in Oaxaca Mexico are some of the best I ve ever had.   The Salsa Bar is also amazing with the best variety and flavors of Hot Sauce in Austin. If you are looking for an amazing lunch or dinner then this is definitely the place 
Polvo's DT,53,Just arrived and host was a complete bitch and did not seem like she wanted to seat us. Let s see how this goes
Polvo's DT,54,I love Polvos food and always will support them  however I went a few weeks ago and it was a scary and disappointing experience. Let me start by saying that the food was incredible as always. No complaints  However the ambiance and safety was not okay.   Thee tables were so close together I was practically touching someone at a table next to me. I felt incredible unsafe as no social distancing was happening at all.   Also- the music was so loud that we couldn t hear each other speak across the table. Some young people had control of the outdoor speaker and they were playing club music. It was disappointing because I couldn t enjoy a night out with my family as we were essentially just participating in a party of 20 somethings totally taking over the back patio.   The music and lack of social distancing made the entire evening one of anxiety. I want to support Polvos but I will absolutely not be dining with them again until they adhere to CDC regulations.
Polvo's DT,55,If I could give 0 stars I would. My girlfriend went to this location and was charged an extra  140  The staff is very hard to get in contact with over the phone. I must have called twenty times before reaching anyone. We were told by staff that only Oscar  the general manager  can do anything to help. Finally  after multiple times trying to get ahold of him  we did  and he told us that it will take 5 - 10 business days to get reimbursed  I don t know how a business can be more unprofessional. Don t go here unless you want to pay hundreds of dollars for food you didn t order and to be treated terribly. We still don t have her money back...
Polvo's DT,56,Polvo s is that perfect downtown ATX spot for great margaritas and beautiful views in a relaxed atmosphere  and was a highlight of our recent trip to Austin. We stopped in after brunch on a Sunday afternoon  and found the place surprisingly empty  although a steady stream of patrons wandered in throughout the afternoon. We were seated on their gorgeous side patio  that overlooks lush Shoal Creek  and I immediately settled in for a relaxing afternoon of drinks and conversation. To start  we ordered a couple of delicious and refreshing Mexican Martinis  an only-in-Austin treat and decided to make mine spicy. We were pleased to see that each martini came in its own shaker  with each consisting of several drinks. We followed that up with some frozen and on-the-rocks margaritas which were delicious and just what you want when in Austin. For snacks  we of course had queso  served with guacamole  pico  and ground beef on the side  and sampled excellent selections from their self-service salsa bar. Polvo s is a perfect place to while away the afternoon with friends and to enjoy drinks on a beautiful downtown patio in the heart of Austin.
Polvo's DT,57,I love the Polvos downtown.  Super cute spot with indoor and outdoor seating. Address technically 360 Neuces street but just follow 3rd to the end where the pedestrian bridge is  it s on the right just before the bridge.  It s about a block from Ballet Austin.  Best enchiladas I have EVER had.  Not joking.  Follow these instructions  order the Enchiladas de la Casa  I get the shredded chicken as my meat choice .  Enjoy.  I do not stray from this order now that I have discovered this.  I ve had tacos at both locations and was not really impressed.  But the enchiladas seriously blew me away.   I usually get a skinny margarita and they do a great job  I tried the jalape o margarita and give that a 2 thumbs up as well.  Pro-tip  you always get tortilla chips and you get up and go to the salsa bar and pick your salsas   Nicole was our server and she was top notch.  I had told her I wanted another margarita when I finished my first and she swooped in with a new one exactly at the right time.
Polvo's DT,58,We we very disappointed   Went to have a nice birthday dinner for my son s 23rd and the drinks were not good  waitress was rude and when we informed management he laughed. Needless to say... we left.
Polvo's DT,59,If I m rating the food this place was a 5. Very very good and I d defiantly come back for more. If I added the service by our waitress I d knock off a star. She was a little slow on checking up on us as we waited to make our orders. But hey it may of been an off night that s why I give this place a 5.
Polvo's DT,60,Such a cute little spot downtown. The outside is right next to the river surrounded by nature. The food was solid but staff really made the place. They were so gratuitous and made us feel welcome the second we walked in the door.  We came with a group of 5 and will absolutely be back 
Polvo's DT,61,Upscale-ish Mexican restaurant with art deco Miami-vibe that is in downtown Austin. Complimentary chips. Salsa bar for 4 . Friendly staff. I went for lunch on a Saturday with my GF. Almost no one else was there so we had fast service. I ordered the nachos and she got both a fish and a vegetarian taco. The fish taco was very good  but the vegetarian was only fair. It also came with rice that was pretty bland. The nachos were delicious  but were made with huge chips.  8.5 10
Polvo's DT,62,Took 2 hours from being sat to paying the check. Waiter had to be flagged down  never checked in once. Never got the sides to my entree. I hope the owner finds Jesus.
Polvo's DT,63,This place is THE BEST place to go with friends  Highly recommend getting a pitcher with whatever food you re craving. The drinks are strong  the food is delicious  and our server  Jonathan  was such a sweetheart. It was my friend s 21st birthday and they gave him a birthday shot on the house. I ordered a burrito compuesto with guac and sour cream for only  19.50  including tax   and it was so big I could only eat half. I m leaving this restaurant completely satisfied  and drunk  and excited to come back 
Polvo's DT,64,worst experience ever. It was my brothers birthday and he chose this restaurant. The waitress had an attitude right away. We told her our drink orders  she forgot them asked my brother what we had ordered while he went to go get salsa. We waited 15 minutes for our drinks and she didn t even bring the correct drinks we ordered. She again had an attitude when we politely told her about the little mix up. She then said  ok  didn t apologize or anything. We got the drinks and the appetizer. She didn t check on us for at least 30 minutes. We then decided this isn t the family dinner we expected. My brother asked to speak to a manager and she went to get him and as shes speaking to him they start laughing. He comes to us saying   you wanted to talk to me    We told him about the service we were getting and that we wanted a new server and he just said  he will fix it we waited about another 15 minutes for our old server saying someone else will take care of us she still had an attitude. We just asked for a check we didn t want to put up with it anymore. It was so sad we drove an hour to come here just to be treated so badly. Wouldn t recommend. Appetizer was also cold and disgusting. We went to Taquero Mucho it had such sweet workers  food was amazing  drinks were  a href   redir url http 3A 2F 2Fbomb.com amp s bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e  rel  nofollow  target  _blank  bomb.com  a  and everyone had a smile. If you want great mexican food go there  
Polvo's DT,65,My husband and I have been here several times before and really enjoyed splitting fajitas for ONE and having a margarita. Salsa bar was different and generally we never needed reservations. Tonight  we took my mom with us and decided to all split the fajitas for TWO so we could show her the place we grew to enjoy so much. We will never be back after the experience. They brought out the fajitas that were twice as expensive as we ordered for two this time  yet the food was the same exact amount as if we were ordering for one. Once we brought this up  we were told this is how the chef measures everything and there was nothing they could do. Then the manager came over  and said he could talk to the chef and owner  about our concerns  but this was their design and their was nothing he could do. It was overall very poorly handled and we ended up paying twice as much for what we normally would get by splitting fajitas for one. DO NOT get the fajitas for two  and don t expect customer service to be great by the manager if you have a complaint or concern.
Polvo's DT,66,Food was mediocre . It has been a while since I been back to this place and now I remember why. We sat outside and it felt like nobody was practicing social distance.. Tables were less than a foot apart from each other. It took us 40min to get the attention of our waiter just to get some water and chips. Our waiter never came back to take our order   till we got up to confront him. Bad service. Okay food. Not impressed at all. There are better Mexican places around Austin to check out instead.
Polvo's DT,67,Waited for over a half an hour for my server to come back to take my order or even get another drink. It was wild. Just sat there waiting for someone to come by. Love coming here cause it s close and like the food. But the service is seriously god awful.
Polvo's DT,68,My In-Laws recently visited and sat at their table for over 20 minutes and not one server approached them to take their order. So they got up and left. I would avoid this restaurant at all costs.
Polvo's DT,69,One of the best patios in Austin. Wish the fountain was still utilized- it added so much to the ambiance.   We came for brunch on a Saturday not expecting anything  amazing .  Unsure why we overlook forget about this gem. Our experience was so good it compelled me to write a review.   Ordered the pastor taco  guisada taco  Piccadillo taco  huevos a la Mexicana with bacon and machacado and egg. They came out SO hot it nearly burned our mouths  That s refreshing. Homemade flour tortillas. ACTUALLY spicy salsa  ordered side of caliente   not that wimpy crap. Authentic micheladas.   Service was spectacular.    To the kind stranger on the phone who picked up our tab  thank you  Would love to know your name     this random act of kindness had zero influence on this glowing review. But dang  it sure did make our day very bright and we look forward to  paying it forward .
Polvo's DT,70,This spot is terrible... waited an hour and a half for drinks... got our queso after 1 hour and still had not received silverware. Ridiculous service and I will not be a returning customer  amp  I have been an Austin resident for 20 years.
Polvo's DT,71,Food and drinks were above average. It was quite mind blowing that we called in to make a reservation  and they did not mention that their AC was out. If you would like to feel like you re eating in Indonesia  just drive 15min down the road to Polvos on Nueces. Missed your afternoon workout sweat session  No problem. Go to polvos.
Polvo's DT,72,Polvo s on south 1st street is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Austin  so I was excited to try their downtown location    When you first walk in  you will notice it is a different atmosphere than you are used to if you frequent the south 1st location a lot. It is a much more eclectic and modern design  and the decor does not remind you of any sort of Mexican style restaurant.   I went with some friends for lunch during the week  and we were seated right away. The menu was extensive  and there are a lot of great options to choose from. I kept it simple and ordered a bean and cheese quesadilla which was much smaller than I expected  but I was glad it was small because it was extremely filling. Of course we had the salsa bar which was delicious  and pretty clean which I don t normally see at the other location.   Our waitress was great  except she was so quiet I couldn t hear a word she said. Otherwise she was attentive and quick. I saw some reviews saying that this location doesn t split checks  but our waitress was willing to split it among 5 people.   Overall it was a great experience  the reason for four stars instead of five is the overall atmosphere just seemed off for a Mexican restaurant  and the flavor in my meal didn t blow me away. I ll definitely be going back though 
Polvo's DT,73,I ve been a fan of the downtown polvos for a while now. Their don chema enchiladas  frozen margs   and the patio is why I didn t give up on the place. BUT after so many fails I had to completely mark it off as a go to. The A C is always out and for some reason dinner turns into a full on club with LOUD music. This was about the 5th time I ve gone and my dinner wasn t enjoyable because I couldn t hear my friends at the dinner table and it was 80 degrees inside.  I would recommend Gloria s over polvos   Gloria s never disappoints.
Polvo's DT,74,Either the people who work here are very stupid or very incompetent. I asked for a table for 2 outdoors and was told it would be about 35 minutes. At the 35 minute mark  I went back into the hostess station and was told we were first in line but that nothing was available yet. I checked again around an hour and was told the same thing. After seeing multiple people go in who arrived after us  I went in the the hostess station for a 3rd time around the 90 minute mark. I told them we had been waiting an hour and a half and they apologized and said they would get us in. I asked point blank if we had been skipped and he said yes. I said how does that happen when I have been in here twice before asking about the table. He said  human error.   Are you F ing kidding me   What a joke.
Polvo's DT,75,Sooo yummy  Very authentic and the service was amazing.  Such good chips and we loved the salsa bar. Unlimited salsas. Three of us got the beef street tacos and it was so tasty. Definitely coming back 
Polvo's DT,76,The downtown location is nice but food was always iffy compared to the South First location. It s gotten really bad  had the worst fish tacos ever last night  red snapper had stringy bits of chewy.. skin   and friend said chile relleno was awfully bland.   I don t know why this location has never been able to pull it together.   PS  even the chips were stale and salsa like dishwater  how does a Mexican restaurant do that in Texas 
Polvo's DT,77,We came here for our wedding anniversary and a waiter dropped a plate of drinks  and one hit my husbands head glass went all in our food and drinks. We probably would have been more forgiving  but we had already been waiting 10 minutes for silverware to eat our food. Needless to say we left immediately after. Happy anniversary to us....
Polvo's DT,78,The best part of Polvo s is the atmosphere.   Food  2 stars   mediocre food that is overpriced. Charging  3.99 for a salsa  bar  is a price gouge we find odd. Even tourist trap Mexican restaurants like Tortilla Joe s at Disneyland serve better  fresh salsa for free with no limits. El Mirasol in Palm Springs ... delicious chips and salsa  unlimited  for free.   Atmosphere  3.5 to 4 stars   both the inside and outdoor patio are nice. We definitely prefer the outdoor patio and will likely continue to eat here on occasion when the weather is nice.  Cocktails   wine list  3 stars   the frozen margaritas here are an interesting idea  but not well done. Most every cocktail including the margaritas that we ve tried here are way too sweet.  Service  3 stars   service for us here has been fine. Nothing exceptional  but also  fortunately  not the bad service described in other reviews.
Polvo's DT,79,We went last weekend on a Saturday night for dinner and drinks. Tables were definitely less than six feet apart and seemed as if no one was practicing social distancing. The restaurant had to be over 50  capacity... I would go as far to say they were almost in full operation.   The service was extremely slow  probably because it was so packed . It took 40 minutes to get a drink and another hour to get our main entrees. The portions were huge  my boyfriend and I split the fajitas. At that point we were waiting so long we were starving and would ve eaten anything they gave us. The food was good  but nothing special.
Polvo's DT,80,Our team ordered take out from their downtown location for lunch. They included gratuity of 18  on our bill without our permission. We called to ask why and they said it s on their website  which it is not. I ordered the daily lunch special and they charged me the full price rather than the special price. We ordered a side of guacamole  the price was  15. The guacamole was literally two scoops  two avocados at most  but mostly pico de gallo  and the price was not listed on the website. We specified no bell peppers on one plate because an employee is very allergic and they included bell peppers anyways. He had to go to CVS to get some emergency allergy medication. When we brought this to the managers attention he said our colleague can  just go to the hospital . We asked them to make this right and they refuse to work with us. Terrible customer service. This place is garbage. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants in town  don t give this place your dollars  they do not deserve it.
Polvo's DT,81,WORST EXPERIENCE IN AUSTIN    My partner recently moved here and he loves margaritas. Knowing Polvo s is a staple we decided to try this new location and he s never been so it seemed like a great idea...BIG NOPE  It took 20 min for our  server  to even acknowledge us. I had to ask the other served to get us a server. TEN MINUTES LATER the server takes our order....2 top shelf margaritas and nachos with chicken....and a Mexican Coke and LIME jalitos. Easy  Haha right. 15 min later we get the  margaritas  and they re awful cuz the dumbass put soda water in them...ugh gross  made us new ones and they were still shit. Comes back and says  was that chicken or beef for your nachos ...CHICKEN. The server had taken the order 20 min ago and still hadn t put it in  Over and hour has gone by and we finally get our nachos. They re burnt and 75  black beans....soggy and disgusting. Manager  stepped out  blah blah blah. Mind you this was after 9 ON A TUESDAY and they were no where near busy. Paid for 2 margaritas.... 25. What a joke....WILL NEVER BE GOING BACK AND WILL TELL EVERY SOUL I KNOW NOT TO GO HERE. Just close
Polvo's DT,82,Well the outdoor patio is nice. Super loud though even outside. The do margaritas pitchers for  35 45ish. I did like the variety of margaritas choices such as coconut. Several selections of salsa and chips. The service was okay. I love mole sauce  but I m sorry to say Curra s Grill  oltorf  has this place beat. There is a public parking garage and for  2.5 hours they charge you  15  whoa 
Polvo's DT,83,Slow service  inattentive service  inexperienced server. Dropped husband s entire plate of fajitas on floor. One of our dinners was brought a long time after the others.  Two of us were served 2 warm beers  since we were told they didn t have cold beer. After a long wait  they brought 2 beers and a pitcher so we could chill beer ourselves. Regular side salad had blue cheese  blackberries  strawberries  amp  pineapple on it  which is odd for a standard side salad.  That was not how it was described on the menu.  Then to top it off  they charged over 20  for their tip since we had 7 people.
Polvo's DT,84,Music was SO LOUD that we couldn t hear each other talk. The staff kept saying that s the way the managers want it.
Polvo's DT,85,Visiting Austin from Florida and I can say this restaurant has the vibe  aura  and energy but even more so extremely authentic food  might be the best I ve ever had. Amazing range of salsas from scratch  attentive service  and quick. Would recommend this to anyone for quality Mexican in the city that has the most options for it.
Polvo's DT,86,We made a reservation for a large group to SIT and eat dinner  manager calls us 15 minutes before reservation saying how it was going to be a standing room social hour which is not what we discussed. There wasn t enough seating and we payed for each couple to get at least a pitcher of margs and dinner. We got one marg per person and quesadillas  absolutely ridiculous  super unprofessional and terrible service.
Polvo's DT,87,I really would avoid this place like the plague pandemic . First of all- no masks required  no dividers  capacity was OVER THE TOP. We had a reservation and waited 50 mins fir our first drinks. I felt like I was in another world it was so upsetting of an experience. No drinks were comped at all and it was as if our customer satisfaction was of negative importance. I have never before avoided a restaurant in Austin in 5 years  this will be my first.
Polvo's DT,88,Food was good  and our waitress did the best she could with the hand she was dealt...   However... I ve been to this restaurant multiple times with my family over the last several years. Tonight the three of us were seated at basically a two top right next to the kitchen. I m usually not that picky about tables but this was just not appropriate for three. I asked the hostess to reseat us and she said take it or leave it.   I won t be going back to Polvos. Ever.
Polvo's DT,89,I was excited to take my friend that would drag me to the Polvos off south first.  After the service  we ll I should say lack of service. When three waiters walked right past our tables with no acknowledgement. I will say the hostess was very sweet and I rarely complain about any food industry because I respect the hard work they do.  But after 20 min of not being brought any water or Ames what we would like to drink.  When another table who arrived 20 min after us got their drinks and chips.  After asking the hostess if there was a waiter assigned to us we were finally seen 10 min later. But at that time we decided not to stay and went to North Italia where we were asked in a timely manner for our drink order and our table service was terrific as I expected.   I will not be returning to Polvos downtown and I would have given this review a negative 5 stars if that was an option. You should be ashamed especially when there was no working AC.   I will be encouraging the people I know to do the same and avoid this restaurant .  Unsatisfied Austinite  
Polvo's DT,90,absolutely horrible service. had a reservation for 8 15 and told us that we needed to wait another 20 minutes to be seated. we made the reservation a week in advance  and then was told to wait. checked back in at 9 and then was told to wait just a few more minutes. at 9 30 they told us that we needed to wait another 45 minutes if we wanted a table and then was advised that we  should just leave.  wish I could put 0 stars.
Polvo's DT,91,This is the spot for the best skinny margarita  I walked in and greeted by a friendly margarita mixologist.  Matteo mixed a refreshing flavor of happiness.
Polvo's DT,92,During ACL 2019  we looked up top rated restaurants near where we were staying and this showed up. The uber dropped us off right outside and we went in and got seated right away. It was towards the end of the night yet our waiter was super friendly and made sure he answered all our questions about the menu and came to check if everything was okay once we got our food. We enjoyed the food. When we received the bill  the tip was already included. It was an 18  tip. I m used to restaurants automatically adding tip when it s a large party  but it was only two of us so I was a little surprised. We assumed it was because it was during ACL.
Polvo's DT,93,The worst service I ve had since I ve lived in Austin. I ve been here for 2 hours and have no place settings  I got my drink an hour and a half in  and my food has yet to come. I asked to speak to the manager and he laughed when my table expressed their concerns. I ve watched two separate tables get up and leave after being here for an hour and half  and there has still not been a remote change in service quality. This is ridiculous. Never coming back.
Polvo's DT,94,I can write a long review  but I m going to get to the point. Shady pricing.   The food is good  the service is frankly not great and recently on a to go order for my wife and I the bartender tried to charge me  15 for some guacamole. I thought he d made a mistake since it s generally an add on to fajitas.. but no  he reiterated that  you can t get guacamole anywhere in Austin for under  15  ..  Except literally  every other Mexican restaurant  even the other Polvos on S. 1st. Maudie s  Matt s el Rancho  El Chile  Taco Flats.. even Fonda   I looked on their menu and  check this out.. guacamole was listed but there was no price next to it. HMMMM...   I went further and pointed out that the Ceviche on his own menu was  14 or  15.. that s seafood. Other appetizers with actual prep time were far less.   Perhaps our late 20 s early thirties bartender with a 90 s soul patch is used to drunk patrons  or Favor drivers who don t care  We ll never know. What I can tell you is that this is no way to do business.. I hope the managers and owners reading this are taking note and making adjustments.   I decided to drop the guacamole and not pay the extra  15 because eff that dude.
Polvo's DT,95,Updating review.  Service seems to be getting a little better  everyone is always friendly  and the quality of the food is consistent.  I would give five stars if they had a better ordering or to go.  Calling only is not ideal and my orders which have allergy restriction do occasionally get messed up.  The quality of food is great though so I ll keep returning
Polvo's DT,96,It pains me to write this review because I have been such a fan of Polvos Downtown for such a long time. They take pride in their food and drinks and it is always so so good. Recently on weekends  however  they turn it into a club and the music is blasting inside  the A C is currently out as well . Please Polvos  turn the music down. I come here to enjoy dinner and drinks with friends  not to scream over music.
Polvo's DT,97,Food was alright  service was horrible. Food took forever  ended up not getting things that were ordered. It seemed like our server was completely avoiding our table  and was definitely giving off an attitude. We did sit outside   and it was hot but that was our choice. The AC was broken inside so not much of a better option. Not a place I would hurry back to.
Polvo's DT,98,Food was absolutely phenomenal.  Authentic  dankness.  Drinks get you buzzed after 1.  Tasteful music selection.  Did I mention how good the food is 
Polvo's DT,99,Time and time again  I continue to give the downtown Polvos location a chance at redeming themselves. And time and time again I end up more disapointed than the last time I promised myself I d never go again. The food and drinks meet the mark for averaged priced mexican food  but the service always and consistenly lacks any sort of decentcy. If you find yourself on the patio on a cold spring tuesday night  62f   be sure to bring a sweater  as they refuse to turn on the heaters to make it even the least bit comforting.  Excuse me  maam  we d like to change to an inside table  due to the lack of working heaters  is that possible   My request was met with a hard no  although multiple tables were available inside with no wait in sight. This will be my last time here  and I m excited to give ATX cocina the try they truly deserve as a regular guest on a weekly basis.
Polvo's DT,100,Food is good but you can definitely get better elsewhere for the price.  The location and patio are great but if you want to try enjoy your meal and conversation with the people you are with  go during lunch.  It seems to be the hot spot for 21-22 year olds on Friday Saturday nights. Lots of loud groups being obnoxious isn t the scene I m looking for.
Polvo's DT,101,Polvo s surprised me.  I live in Los Angeles  but maintain an office in Austin...but this was my first time back in 14 months.  Missed ya Austin   Because LA has such strict and sensible COVID safety requirements  I admit I was COMPLETELY disappointed by the lack of proper spacing between tables  and that they allowed very large groups to eat together  which is not allowed in LA.  I was extremely disappointed by their lack of COVID awareness.  But  even though they were busy  I found the service superb - friendly  attentive and fast.  Great service always save the day.  Chips and queso were blah  but that could also be because I burned my tongue off having a salsa that was way too hot for my weak palette  . Also the Mexican rice they serve is pretty amateur.  The star of the visit was the guisada.  I m about to say something big  it was the best guisada that I ve had since my Grandma made it for the family.  It was excellent   I ll be back just for the guisada  and FYI  the steak tacos also fantastic   Oh  and the frozen margaritas.  I haven t had a frozen margarita in forever...they were great  and pretty strong.  Highly recommend 
Polvo's DT,102,Yeah  it s cool. We got the Enchiladas de la casa with shredded chicken and the Chile Rellenos Original. Chips and their salsa bar are an amazing combo  serve yourself.   As for the limes  4 5. I was presented with an arrangement of 5 various sized lime wedges  very squeezable and juicy. Yeh dawg  I d come back.  Their other location is good too  but I m not there right now  so I m not gonna write a review.
Polvo's DT,103,I dont know why people rate this place 4 star. I have tried the best Mexican food here in my life
Polvo's DT,104,I ve been touch and go on Polvo s on S 1st for years now.  It used to be on my blacklist  but I finally found something I liked and any other reason I may have avoided it has dissipated.  We were mildly excited to see a location downtown.  Fortunately  it has turned out okay.   Food is fairly identical to S 1st.  The salsa bar isn t quite what I remember they have down south.  The wait staff is a little green  and the prices are what you might expect for downtown.  Not sure how I feel about paying  20 for enchiladas  tea  and a tip  but where else are you going to go on foot downtown when you re too far away from Chili Parlor 
Polvo's DT,105,Club Polvos  Pros  Mexican martinis. Cons  crowded even during covid  super loud club music that they say they can t lower  even a little  so if you re going for dinner  forget any conversation. That might be your thing  but if not don t go. Been here a few times  for the martinis  and service is terrible. Go to the with south first location and sit outside if you can t give up the Mexican martinis.
Polvo's DT,106,I like it a lot   Polvo s DT location is tucked away off Nueces overlooking Shoal Creek. The decor is a far cry from the South location  dressed in a kind of minimalist industrial vibe with Latin overtones. The staff was very friendly and inviting despite my shabby attire.   The salsa bar was a success. I love fire roasted salsas and their iteration was great. My favorite part was the escabeche. Tender  thick cut carrot  onion rajas and whole jalapenos in vinegar. What a great antojito accompaniment. The acid helps cut through the grease of the choriqueso. Off to a great start   I thought that the margaritas were phenomenal. I ordered the cantaloupe with mezcal  which intriguingly came out green. Their margs are strong  but you won t realize until you re done. My partner informed me that the artificial flavor was too prominent  too sweet. I didn t notice. A  margaritas.  11 a pop is pricey for HH but what can I say.   I got the chile relleno with beef fajita which is my standard first order at a Mexican restaurant. My portion was generous and absolutely stuffed with fajita  no filler. The flour tortillas are super good here. I think they make them in house. Rice and beans were well prepared  and they generally act as a good barometer of the overall quality of food a Mexican restaurant puts out. My only qualm was with the chintzy side salad  some limp spring mix and diced tomato in a generic vinaigrette. But compared to the shredded iceberg at your standard Tex-Mex affair it was good. So I guess that is not really a fair complaint.   I will be back. If the HH margaritas were priced a little more reasonably  I d be back a lot. But I will be back regardless.
Polvo's DT,107,Horrible service. They never brought our drinks and I had to go to the hostess stand to ask for more chips. Sad    sorry never again
Polvo's DT,108,One of my favorite restaurants but.. they really don t take covid precautions. The food is great  pricing is great and not to mention it s super cute. But if you are going  i d recommend you go on a weekday because weekends are impossible and it looks like covid isn t even a thing.
Polvo's DT,109,Delicious interior Texmex at a reasonable price.  I had the chile relleno al nogal. The dish is served with pecans and raisins similar to Matt s. Thrilled I can walk from my office for wonderful Mexican. The tortillas are homemade and full of flavor. Definitely stop by the salsa bar too. I can t wait to return.
Polvo's DT,110,After waiting for Polvo s downtown to open  just in time for SXSW   we tried it tonight.  When the Facebook  Proper and Independent buildings are complete  this will be a sweet location on Shoal Creek just up from the library.  On this evening  we sat outside with our Golden Retriever.  Other puppies were on the shaded patio   We ordered two beers  a chicken tortilla soup and a mole enchilada dinner.  Operations were a bit rocky but forgivable given the completion of SX the day prior and their real first day open post-SXSW.  Some of the items on the menu  e.g. nopales salad  are not available as of this writing.  Happy hour lasts until 7 00 pm during the week  insure about the weekend hours .  The good  Nice patio Good location on shoal creek Friendly staff Nice fish options on menu with reasonable prices  I didn t try since I wasn t hungry enough for an entree -just had soup  Mole enchiladas  Nice simple inside decor Very dog friendly   The just ok  Chips and salsa Tortilla soup Server s training  What I will try next time  A fish entree A margarita   This is a nice addition to the downtown food scene.
Polvo's DT,111,We made a reservation for 50 people on the patio. Upon arrival they had every table full. While they did give us free shots and margaritas for our trouble  the disrespect from this restaurant was infuriating. I do NOT recommend this restaurant especially for a large group. Disappointing. Workers were talking under their breath while we were finally seated. If this app allowed me to give zero stars I would.
Polvo's DT,112,The food was good but the service was TERRIBLE. We got charged for things that the kitchen brought out and we didn t eat. They said since it was on our table we had to pay. Asked to speak to the manager and they waitress said she didn t have one. She automatically added gratuity and kept adding stuff on our bill every time we sent it back. It was absolutely ridiculous. I can t even explain how rude the waitress was.
Polvo's DT,113,It had been so long since I have been to Polvo s  Only accustomed to the one down South  I didn t even realize this downtown location existed. On the water with a charming patio  no less  This downtown location certainly evokes a different  more upscale atmosphere than their other location with a more sleek design at the base of a sleek downtown building. The one downside of the downtown location is parking. It s literally tucked away in the corner of a dead end street  and from what I can tell there is no valet. I am hoping there is a dedicated parking garage or lot for this location that I just missed somehow. I ended up parking across the street at a luxury apartment building that wasn t necessarily cheap. However  the fun atmosphere along with good company made it all ok   It s super loud in this busy restaurant  but the staff and service was on point  especially for our large group of ladies with all different types of complicated orders. The layout is also kind of interesting. With the bar right at the front  the long and narrow space doesn t allow for a whole lot of flow and can get congested easily.   The food  however  was delish  I ordered the Enchiladas Dona Clara   Two homemade enchiladas dipped in a rich guajillo sauce  amp  stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese  onions  decorated with cabbage  jalape os  avocado   amp  dried cheese and a refreshing agua fresca to wash it down. The salsa bar was in full effect  of course  and all in all I d like to return. But definitely on a slower night where I can hear my dining companions and maybe enjoy the patio 
Polvo's DT,114,The food was amazing and so was the service  I would recommend this place to anyone. I got the chicken quesadillas and they tasted great  Johnathon gave me and my friends an amazing time.
Polvo's DT,115,Went on a Saturday night and it was poppin  music  food  drinks. One of my favorite places I ate at in Austin. Authentic Tex-Mex. I couldn t even tell you what I ordered but all I know is that our table had probably 5 pitchers of margaritas a few rounds of Coronas and a huge meal and my bill was  23. A little packed but has a huge outdoor seating area as well as an inside area. Outside had good music playing and a bunch of tables it was almost like a party. Will definitely be back.
Polvo's DT,116,Pitcher margs  frozen or on rocks   salsa bar  and good food. What more can you ask for.
Polvo's DT,117,We ve been to this location three times and each time service has been subpar at best  especially when compared to their S 1st location.   Tonight  three different waiters passed us. Aside from the hostess  who wasn t at her station but sitting at the bar when we arrived  no one acknowledged us. After waiting over 5 minutes with no sign of someone coming to our table  we left.   I addressed the hostess before leaving  who was again sitting at the bar  letting her know that no one had come to our table and we didn t want to wait. She just asked  do you want to take food to go   Um... no.   If I could make a suggestion to management - tell to your staff to actually care to have customers come through the door. They are dripping with apathy. There are so many great places to eat in Austin  that having bad service is a major turn off.   We won t be back to this location.
Polvo's DT,118,Wow this place was unexpectedly beautiful. We sat outside on the outdoor patio and as the sun went down  all of these string lights across the patio and around nearby trees turned on. Such a nice touch for such a nice . I honestly could not stop saying  this place is so cute     all evening. The service was very good and the food was even better. The margaritas also did not disappoint 
Polvo's DT,119,I do not know where to start with this review. I ordered my food through a third party and was shocked when it arrived. First off  15 for guacamole   that was subpare at best  was the size of a small soup.  This price was NOT listed.  Secondly  the food was tasteless and had hardly any flavor. Thirdly   they automatically added 18  gratuity that was not authorized and was not posted on the website.  I m all for tipping 20  but this definitely was not justified. And last but certainly not least  the customer service was the worst I have ever encountered.  The manager laughed at me over the phone when I was concerned with my order. He continued to argue with me over the smallest issues.  Never in my life have I ever experienced such bad act of customer service  especially in a time where we all need each other in such a loving way. Please take your business elsewhere. This place does not deserve your precious money.
Polvo's DT,120,It s my favorite place to eat. The fajitas are great and the margs are amazing. I would say one of the better quality foods downtown.
Polvo's DT,121,Amazing bartenders.  Great corn tortillas  Caldo de pollo e marisco amazing . Thank you very much. Delicious margaritas too
Polvo's DT,122,Fun tequila spot with interesting twists on traditional Mexican dishes. Great chips  amp  hot sauce.. cozy little dining rooms spaces both inside  amp  outside.
Polvo's DT,123,Worst service ever. Very rude comments from the buser to one of the women in our party and the hostess and manager did not care and was equally rude.
Polvo's DT,124,Four of us had dinner there on a Saturday night.  The interior was nice and they have a great patio.  I had one of their spicy fish dishes recommended by the waitress.  My fish was good  I love spicy  and so was the rice. The little salad on the plate was a little funky tasting.  My husband wasn t crazy about the sauce on the Shrimp Verzcruzano. My son and his girlfriend said the beef fajitas were a little too greasy.  My frozen margarita was good and so was the salsa bar and chips.
Polvo's DT,125,I love this place  There has beauful patio and good view  Foods and drinks all very excellent  Hope everyone can enjoy
Polvo's DT,126,Went to Polvo s with a group of 5 last week. The waitstaff was very friendly and nice  and per their advice we ordered 2 margarita pitchers to share among the group- one house  one strawberry- and were happy with the quality of both. My vegetable enchiladas were great as well.   They did have somewhat of a hard time accommodating the size of our group  though the restaurant was only about half-full when we arrived. Also to note- free chips  but no free salsa. Their outside area was very nice  though  and we all enjoyed our time.
Polvo's DT,127,I was visiting Austin  TX for a long weekend trip with one of my best friends. On our first night in Austin  we were on the search for awesome Mexican food and margaritas to start off our first dinner in Austin. Our Airbnb recommended polvos for the best margaritas and Mexican and we also heard other recommendations so we decided to give it a shot..... and to say we were disappointed is an understatement.   First  if you are looking for a trendy  cute atmosphere- this is NOT it. Kind of dingy looking and musky inside. My friend and I felt overdressed with our leather jackets with jeans and booties. Second  the food is served in BIG portions and it is all kind of just mushed together with WAY too much salt and not enough flavor. We both got fajitas and couldn t even finish our meals. The guac also was served in the smallest dish ever and was not tasty at all- the chips also tasted like Tostitos chips.   Then- the margaritas were sugary and watered down. We both got coconut margs on the rocks and were not impressed whatsoever. To top it off  we got the bill and were shocked on the price for the food we got. We were also charged for the salsa bar when the waitress gave us the impression that it was a self service bar that was on the house with no charge.   Safe to say- if you are looking for good Mexican and margs while in Austin- don t come here     You will be disappointed.
Polvo's DT,128,Hey Polvos. Get your Covid -19 shit together.  Too many people in the restaurant to pick up.  Employees up in each other s face.  Delivering food without gloves.  Handling my card  Give me an unsanitary check holder and having to sign with a pen on the counter.   Get it together.   And you forgot my tortillas.   Thank you.
Polvo's DT,129,First time here with fam.and I ordered 3pounds  fajita 2 order  and dang all I see is onions and  bell peppers I didn t order vegetables
Polvo's DT,130,Extremely poor service  went on my lunch break and they would not come up to us or check on us even after complaining for the manager multiple times. The food and drinks were good but I will NOT be coming back or recommending this restaurant to my friends.
Polvo's DT,131,Service was bad  server didn t check on us. Masks are enforced while you re waiting. Very crowded for 50  capacity. Food was ok. Probably won t be going back.
Polvo's DT,132,This is my first time in Austin and I was told I needed to come to Polvos. Worst mistake of my life. I am a college student who is on a budget and I ordered a pitcher. They did not include the price on the menu and when I asked they told me  30. I was then charge  50 for the pitcher with no way to get out of it. This was a SCAM. Kudos to the company because they must be making a lot of money but I would not recommend this establishment. I am just very upset because I have never been treated with the disrespect like I have been at Polvos. I was so excited for my first experience in Austin but was sadly let down.     
Polvo's DT,133,Honestly the amount of money I have spent tonight on two terrible  watered down pitchers is absurd. They overcharged us because of their  location.  And yes I understand the price of I was drinking a margarita of patron but it s only el toro with margarita mix AT MOST. I will not be returning. If you re smart  you will not be either.
Polvo's DT,134,Pros  the food is really good and the atmosphere on the patio is great. However  the service is routinely awful.
Polvo's DT,135,The wait service was great  however the hostess working at the time was so rude and disrespectful. She made fun of customers right in front of us. Not a great way to represent a restaurant. I ve been coming here for many years and I don t know if I will be returning.
Polvo's DT,136,First issue they need to address is EXPOSURE. Nobody seems to even know this new location exists... And if you try and google it or map it  it only shows the south 1st location. How do you expect to bring in new customers if nobody knows you exist or can even find you   SERVICE  Bleh. Seriously  that s the kind of attitude they carry. The host at the front took our name and table size  but refused to give us an estimated wait time. Judging by the number of empty tables  we figured it wouldn t be too long. 1.5 hours later  we were seated.  - I also checked with him halfway to get an ETA and let him know our entire party was here and ready to be seated  and he quickly snapped back at me that  I know where you all are waiting  and don t need to be reminded of who all is in your party.  - Okay  rude much  - The bartender also rolled her eyes at us when we motioned to here we were ready to order another round of drinks. Why is there only one bartender working on a Friday night in the first place    Once we got our table  we only saw our waiter a grand total of 3 times over the entire course of the meal. 1.  Drink orders  2.  Food orders  3.  Bill. THAT WAS IT  I had to get up multiple times to get drinks refilled  additional silverware  etc.   The food itself was good  Nothing incredible  and about on par with other tex-mex places like Matt s El Rancho or Maudies. But due to the lack of service and the time it took to get seated I d probably choose the latter.  The atmosphere was nice  and the view from the patio area was really cool and relaxing. Might come back here to grab a drink or happy hour but other than that it s not worth the time or effort.
Polvo's DT,137,This place is a joke we just got charged  100 for 2 pitchers of margaritas. If u have any respect for yourself stay as far away from this place as you possibly can. That is  unless you enjoy watered down margaritas that won t even get you drunk enough to justify paying for them.
Polvo's DT,138,Polvos you did it again  this place need work done from the food to the service provided by the waiters food was really salty  the service could have been better our waiter Rafael was just 100  there  he never clean our table he brought us the checks all the dirty dishes in the table it was just awful  and the bad part he add gratuity to our checks when it was only 5  thats was not a 20  service honestly.
Polvo's DT,139,Everything we had tonight was delicious  Great salsa variation  amazing queso  wonderful frozen margaritas  and stellar beef fajitas. Friendly service and a lovely ambience. Highly recommend 
Polvo's DT,140,Great place  Loves the queso and the guacamole and would highly recommend. Did a pitcher of margs during happy hour and life was good  Didn t order dinner but our apps and drinks were honestly awesome.   We will 100  come back to try a full dinner next time we are in the mood for tacos as Elizabeth was great and food was solid.
Polvo's DT,141,Delicious place.  An upscale riff on their tried and true menu. Great shrimp dish and red snapper fish.
Polvo's DT,142,This place has pretty standard Mexican fare. You have a salsa bar  margaritas  guac  etc. The food itself is average  probably not worth what they charge - but eating at a restaurant isn t just about the food. They do have a nice outdoor patio overlooking Shoal Creek. The location is convenient if you live downtown. The staff were fine - not memorable  but not horrible either. All around an average place with a nice relaxing patio.
Polvo's DT,143,If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. The place is arranged very nice and it really does have a warming atmosphere. It is the SERVICE and FOOD that make it not worth it. I ordered a margarita and Ribeye Fajitas for dinner. The food was SOOO bad I don t even know where to begin.  The fajitas had way too much fat on them and they definitely over did it with the pieces of garlic and this is coming from a GARLIC LOVER who loves garlic. IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH  I couldn t eat it. My friend ordered shrimp cocktail and she did not like it either. I used to be a waitress and try not to complain if I don t have to. WELL THIS PLACE WAS BAD ENOUGH  I HAD TO. When it was time to pay for some reason the waitress told us she could split up our food but not our drinks. I do not like places where they don t split checks because it is an inconvenience. of ALL PLACES I WAITED TABLES AT. WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD FOR THE CUSTOMER  Iron Cactus DT  Gloria s Domain  Chuy s Tex-Mex  Antonio s Tex-Mex  El Rancho  THEY ALL SPLIT CHECK. In the ten years I waited tables  and off all places I worked at  they all split checks. It is a TREMENDOUS inconvenience when businesses don t split checks. IT was a party of about 10 and after noticing everyone was too busy talking and having a good time to worry about doing the math and writing down who needs to pay what   one of the guys at at our table pulled out his card and payed the over  300 tab. POOR GUY  He was a friend of the birthday girl we were all celebrating and he even had to pay for people he didn t even know  I gave him cash for my drink but I didn t notice anyone else giving him anything. IT ALL GOES BACK TO THEM NOT SPLITTING CHECKS FOR CUSTOMER  When IT was time to pay for the food  I handed the waitress MY card to pay for our food and she never brought it back to us. SHE LOST OUR CARD   and didn t even apologize to us. SHE said she put it at the far end of the table and we asked  WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE IT THERE WHEN WE HANDED YOU OUR CARD  The waitress just kept repeating her self instead of just owning up to her mistake and apologizing. Manager in charge was a skinny  bald  Hispanic guy did absolutely nothing for our terrible experience. BY FAR THE WORSE PLACE   I have dinned at in a while AND even though it has a convenient location  close to the bars. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN.
Polvo's DT,144,We came here on Saturday night as it was the only place Downtown that could sit a party of 7 without a wait. We walked straight in  I had seen the mix of good and bad reviews on here  but I had eaten here before and knew the food was good. Our waitress took our orders without writing anything down  so we were initially impressed. It look a minute for our drinks to get to us  but we were having a good time eating chips and chatting so we didn t mind. Our food came  and one of my friends did not receive her meal. It was obvious that it had not been put in. The waitress confirmed her order  but didn t apologize or say she forgot to ring it up and it did not arrive until the rest of us were finished eating. Not only did it take about 20 min to come out after our food  the dish had the wrong meat. The waitress did not apologize once  not for it being late or being wrong. She only offered to bring out the correct order  but we were ready to leave. It was after 9pm at this point and we had all finished eating. She eventually said she would take the meal off the cost  but still no apology. I was kind of surprised. All of us have worked in the service industry before  and she definitely could have made it right by apologizing and explaining she had just forgotten to ring it up. She had no expression on her face  and just threw the check on the table in a puddle of water on the table at the end of the meal. Maybe she was just having a bad night  but an apology would have gone a long way. She also only refilled our waters once  and never asked us if we even wanted to order a second round of drinks. I would have given 1 star due to the poor service  but our food was truly delicious. I do not think we will return to this location. Such a shame that the service is so terrible  the location is beautiful and the food is delicious. I guess they just bank on that and don t care if people come back.
Polvo's DT,145,This place is disgusting.  Our waiter messed up our order  was rude  and profiled us.  Do not go here.  It s so disappointing that this is the service we get during this hard times.
Polvo's DT,146,Live right next to them and LOVE THEM    At least once or twice a week  now that we are dealing with a virus we still order take out and they go above and beyond with accuracy of estimated wait time  good quantity and quality they even make sure you get chips and salsa.  And the takeout margs are the perfect pick me up for a cabin fever.  Support your local businesses   We love you Polvo s  Can t wait to have our first post-date quarantine with you   
Polvo's DT,147,Polvos is my favorite restaurant in Austin  So happy for this downtown location. You can t go wrong with fish fajitas and a pitcher of frozen margaritas. At this new location  because we come here so often -   least weekly  I ve been able to try more of their menu items  and everything has been delicious. This is my happy spot and as a born  amp  raised Austinite  I will never understand anyone who doesn t like this place.
Polvo's DT,148,They do not appear to actually have a manager on staff. I have called 12-15 times trying to obtain a copy of a receipt. Of the few times the phone has been answered  I have been told to call back at a certain time to speak with a manager. When I do  I am told the manager isn t there. Voicemails and the three e-mails that I have sent have also gone ignored.  If a manager will please respond to the e-mails you have in your inbox requesting a receipt  I will update this review.
Polvo's DT,149,Very disappointed.  1. they did not let us know that we had to pay for each bowl of chips. there was also a salsa bar that was great. but  they didn t inform us that each bowl of salsa was  3.99  2. i ordered a  14 quesadilla for my meal  since it was in the dinner section. when i got it  there were 4 little triangles and a scoop of guacamole. this was very disappointing for the price i paid. 3. we were in a large party of 18. they were very unaccommodating. they would NOT split the check. the restaurant definitely could have informed us when we made the reservation or when we sat down to order.  overall  good food and service but WAY OVERPRICED.
Polvo's DT,150,Food was good. Environment was great. Service terrible. Took us 3 houra for dinner and not by choice. Waited over an hour for our check while the server kept saying he would get to us but serviced every other table besides ours. Not again.
Polvo's DT,151,Carter rocked it.  Must have been a 20 top. Birthday party demanding crowd he kept his composure straight solid attitude everyone got fed drinks were on point if you need a great night this guy will make it happen solid Experience
Polvo's DT,152,Food was good. Chips were lightly salty and crunchy. What about the salsa you may ask   Well I couldn t tell you because I refuse to pay  3.99 for salsa. Who does this   Every Mexican restaurant in Texas provides complimentary salsa. Polvo s has decided that their salsa is a step above. PSHH   Get over yourselves Polvo s     neveragain  texansagainstsalsatax  ursalsaaintspecial
Polvo's DT,153,This was my first time eating here  and I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the enchiladas that I ordered. It tasted super fresh  and it had tons of flavor. The guacamole was perfect  and had a great amount of lime. I didn t love the margaritas  they tasted a little artificial to me  but other than that it was a good experience
Polvo's DT,154,We arrived on cinco de mayo  a bit of a initiation but fire.... an hour waif for a table  totally acceptable considering the Saturday   derby   cinco combo. We had some drinks and sat outside before being seated inside at a noisy table near the bar.   Food. When it came  was good - it took more than an hour and forty five minutes though. Even this would have been ok considering the circumstances  had they kept us informed - we were patient for the first hour      but subsequently had to KEEP asking for updates and were given vague and unhelpful responses. We had to repeatedly ask what was happening  as in every 20 mins or so  - and we re offered one round of free drinks so keep us going while we sat. And sat. And sat.   I understand they are new and were busy but the wait was really much too long.   Not wanting to Judge a book by its cover  or even the opening chapter  we ll be back again no doubt    but my preference remains the original location for sure.
Polvo's DT,155,First time coming in to Polvos today. Food was excellent  we ordered fajitas and mole enchiladas. The highlight  though  was the service. Ramiro was our server and I highly recommend requesting him.
Polvo's DT,156,3.5 stars.  Still not as good as the OG on South 1st. The downtown has made major improvements since they first opened and offer a good option for casual downtown dining with quality food and margaritas.
Polvo's DT,157,This location is perfection. I love all of their seating  even outdoors rocks an awesome ambiance. Remember this is a get your own salsa kinda place  the salsa bar is inside in the center. They bring the cups to you. Their waitstaff is very knowledgeable when it comes to their menu items  and they are also pleasant and accommodating. All fajita dishes are amazing from beer soaked beef to seafood  my fav is chicken and love their shrimp   and any enchilada with fajita chicken meat is on point  and I m not an enchilada girl  so that s saying something . Their house margs are so tasty and strong. ENJOY   
Polvo's DT,158,Pull it together Polvos Downtown    I have been a fan of the S. 1st location for years... Their website says they open at 10 30am...I go around 10 45  but they actually open at 11. I sit down and have to wipe crumbs off my seat. They bring me a basket of stale chips. I order a breakfast dish with eggs  fried bananas  beans  and chipotle sauce  then am told 5 minutes later they are out of bananas...do I want to sub avocado   Sure. The dish comes out without avocado  but has undercooked potatoes and rice  and some tomato sauce that has no chipotle flavor.  I tell the waitress  she takes it back  then brings it right back with some avocado thrown on top  and says it is chipotle sauce...I ve been there for 25 minutes already  and decide I ll just take a breakfast taco to go... They still charge me for the taco. The taco was pretty good.
Polvo's DT,159,The service absolutely sucks and the atmosphere  while modern and cool  is totally geared towards large parties of drunk youngsters. I hate to say that since I ve been going to Polvos on S 1st since they first opened. Love the food and the owner but stay away from the downtown location unless you re planning on partying hard.
Polvo's DT,160,First time at this place. If you re looking for a strong margarita this is the place. Food was ok  I got chicken with mushrooms. However  the Carne Guisada and the flour tortillas are really good. Place was very busy and the service was not so good  waitress took forever and finally we had to go ask her for our check.
Polvo's DT,161,Save your money  this place is cutting big corners.  We paid  3.99 for the  Salsa Bar  and they didn t stock the salsa bar  and left our small bowl of chips empty for 10 minutes. The only decent salsa was empty half the time we were there. The server s are too busy on their phones and twirling each others hair  to bother with the customers. The margarita was missing alcohol  and the cheese enchilada was actually an onion enchilada with a little cheese. The beef fajita enchilada was more like a beef jerky enchilada. Don t waste your time or your money.
Polvo's DT,162,Nohemi was the best server our group has had in years.  She anticipated our needs and was there exactly when you needed her.  The fajitas were absolutely perfect and the salsa bar was fresh and perfectly arranged.  They just need to get on open table to make this place perfect.
Polvo's DT,163,I went here with a couple friends on Cinco de Mayo. The food was pretty good but the service was a little lacking. I really just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for opening your restaurant in the middle of a pandemic for us to come to and try to have a little bit of normalcy in our lives. Allowing us to sit down and be served a meal in a social setting - something we haven t been able to do in months. We watched some lady  we will call her Karen  FREAK out on every employee she could get her hands on about who knows what. It was totally unnecessary and you guys were super busy and didn t deserve that. I look forward to coming back when things are  normal  again. And hopefully Karen will be somewhere else.
Polvo's DT,164,Waited 45 minutes and saw multiple groups of people get seated before us  who did not have reservations. Turns out they seated a group under our name. When they finally seated us it was on a foldable table. Food was bland. Asked for lime salt  and hot sauce multiple times and never got it. Service seems to vary depending on what type of group of people you belong to  if you know what I mean.
Polvo's DT,165,This is probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in town   12 10 would recommend  I was sitting next to the costumer with the  dirty napkin  and he was being super mean to the waiter and the manager. He got up every 5 seconds and complained. Me and my family s loved our food and the serves was amazing.  If you re looking for a nice and chill restaurant this is the place   
Polvo's DT,166,Polvos was an outstanding venue for a large party to celebrate a birthday. The patio layout works well for groups and the service was excellent. Was surprised by how inexpensive the food and drinks were.
Polvo's DT,167,We love the 1st street location and take friends from out of town there for brunch  lunch  amp  dinner BUT the night before Thanksgiving we walked to the Nueces Street location and were very disappointed. The  large  ceviche order was maybe 1 2 cup with a big bowl of lettuce  tequila shots were huge because it was diluted with what waiter said ice but it was cold and there was no ice and didn t taste like tequila and mixed plate of fajitas was again more vegetables  yeah for me  but only enough meat for one fajita. Very disappointing - was it that location  The fact that is was the night before Thanksgiving   It s convenient for those of us that live downtown but not if you are hungry. Definitely go to 1st Street location
Polvo's DT,168,A co-worker and I went in on February 11 to have lunch. My co-worker paid for her lunch and I  paid separately for the lunch I ordered.  The waitress charge my card and then charge my card again an unauthorized different amount. My lunch was 19.23 including tip and tax. The additional unauthorized amount charged to my card was 14.06. I called and asked to speak to the manager about the unauthorized  charge and was told by Carlos there is no manager. I explained that my card was charged fraudulently and although the amount isn t very much money  it was not authorized. He said it would be reversed and it has not been reversed to date. It is listed as pending in my account.  I called back again today and he said to bring my bank statement. I explained the charge needed to be reversed  they have my card on file because he was able to pull both tickets she rang up when I  spoke with him on February 11. I explained her ringing up my card separately was not a mistake. She absolutely knew she was charging my card a second time and it was unauthorized. She only provided me the one receipt of 19.23. The 14.06 is a minimal amount and what I am most upset about is they won t give me a manager s number I can speak to that can resolve this situation.  I called my bank and I will dispute the amount  then file charges for the fraudulent transaction against my account. I have the table number  waitress information and the receipt the receipt I signed for in the amount of 19.23. I also have my bank statement listing the unauthorized charge. My take from this mess. Check your card statements to ensure this doesn t happen to you.  It s theft and should not be happening. My hope is that a manager or owner reads this review and resolves this situation.
Polvo's DT,169,Hey Team.   Always appreciate coming in since you opened in the neighborhood   Wanted to reach out and share some thoughts.  I most often come in mid week when the crowd is a bit lighter but the music seems to be very loud up front. When I ve been one of the few in later I ve asked for the music turned down yet then only returned to a high volume because the kitchen can t hear it   Secondly  the AC should probably be addressed as in the summer with the high ceilings it s not doing the job   You deserve the 5 stars but as a business owner I know I would appreciate feedback as well   Thanks so much for joining us in the hood and wish you continued success 
Polvo's DT,170,This place was a complete disaster at 7 00pm on a Tuesday. The host had no idea how long the wait would be  he actually told me after waiting for 20 minutes that the wait is  getting longer . What the hell does that even mean    I went to the bar for a margarita  which was completely awful. I ve had better at Chili s  which is unacceptable. When I told the  bartender  that it was horrible she asked to remake it. The disgusting concoction that she returned with was ridiculous    What Mexican restaurant bartenders can t make a proper margarita  While standing at the bar I noticed a server throw a stack of menus at the host  which eventually all  fell on the floor. When I asked for a manager I was told that they didn t have one at the moment. When I asked what  at the moment  meant I was told that their manager called in sick therefor they would not have one for the evening. After receiving a full refund for the disgusting drinks  my entire party left and took an Uber to Gloria s where there was in fact a manager and the bartenders could make drinks.   As a very long time patron of Polvos on 1st  this was a HUGE disappointment. If you want the great experience  drinks and food of the dive Polvos...take the drive to 1st. You won t be disappointed there.
Polvo's DT,171,I went to Polvos on 1st street and had a great experience so I decided to try out this location. I am sad to say that I felt taken advantage of and experienced the worst customer service. I was surprised that we got seated so quick so that was a plus  We ordered our food and never saw our server again other than to see if we needed a new margarita once in awhile.  Little did we know she was upcharging us for top shelf tequila that we did not ask for. After we received our bill and asked about the charges our server fought us and insisted that we did. In reality  she only asked 1 person at our table what kind of tequila they wanted. No one except that 1 person ordered wanted top shelf. We never had our waters filled throughout the night When we asked for the bill from another server because ours was no where to be found  they brought us the wrong one. Shoot  I wish we paid that bill because it was only  55 dollars compared to the upcharges we got. The manager came over and was no help. We still were charged incorrectly but after all the fuss we wanted to get out of there. It was embarrassing to bring my friends here.
Polvo's DT,172,I love their margaritas... They are so tasty  The food is awesome  Their Fajitas and Puntas de Res are amazing  I often crave their shrimp cocktail. It tastes like in Mexico. This restaurant really offers tasty and truly interior Mexican cuisine  Good job 
Polvo's DT,173,The food is amazing. I got the quesadilla compuesto with queso and it was great. The margarita pitchers are pretty cool too. However  the music is atrocious. Whoever made the playlist for this place is most likely the most annoying person on the planet.
Polvo's DT,174,Never eating here again. Just got back. No one but me inside the restaurant. I waited more than a half an hour for fajitas salad. Ignored by the staff. When the salad showed up  it was severe hot   and I used to grow my own chilies . Could not eat. And  I live in the building and have been here before  for decidedly mediocre food . Stay away.
Polvo's DT,175,If I could give half a star I would. Let me just start by saying my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to relax and enjoy a meal after a hard week. The first thing that happens  is the host seats a couple who came in after us. After waiting 10 minutes we are seated...not so bad. We are given water and chips and we re ready to enjoy the night. 10 minutes go by and our waiter  who was the host  comes to take our order. We order our drinks  app and food since we noticed it was so busy and taking a bit longer. He writes down our order and walks away. 20 minutes go by and nothing comes  not even our drinks . Our waiter finally comes and has the audacity to say  what are we waiting on   My boyfriend and I looked confused and I said  everything     He then goes  oh the guacamole  ....we did not order quac. So then he says he ll be out with our drinks in just a minute. Another 20 minutes go by and the waiter comes back and says  I just want to make sure I have everything right  and reads us back our order INCLUDING our drinks. Another 20 minutes and still nothing. Finally a manager comes by and asks if we ve been taken care of  and we told him  well not really  and tell him the story. He promises us margs on the house and then our drinks and food start coming out  except instead of margs on the house  he gets us ONE beer. ONE  2 beer . The food and drinks were okay  not to mention I got brought the wrong drink  but this was the worst service I have ever experienced. Why did we stay  Couldn t tell ya. At least it s a night my boyfriend and I will remember and can laugh about now  but wow what a disappointment from a  75 meal. NOT worth it.
Polvo's DT,176,This place is amazing  We were walking around downtown Austin and had a hankering for Mexican food. We consulted Yelp and found Polvo s. It is very modern upbeat in appearance and did not feel particularly inviting to us  not our style  but we went in anyway due to hunger     What a surprise  Wonderful warm and personable wait person. And hands down some of the best Mexican food we ve ever eaten. All the sauces were really flavorful...homemade tortillas...salsa bar...YUM
Polvo's DT,177,Hoping for improvement-- Long story short. They don t take reservations but you can get on a  waitlist  4-5 days ahead of time for first come first served tables  supposedly. Pretty much a reservation. Unfortunately  not all of the staff are aware of this  waitlist  so we were told 10-15min for an inside table three times. Then another staff person told us about this  waitlist  and our wait  may be extraordinarily  long....back and forth. Then- we could be seated if we rushed our meal. Then the very sweet manager let us know we d be accommodated. Our party ate and the staff we d interacted with avoided eye contact though the manager checked on us. Before we got our meal  the restaurant was 75  empty  see photo. As we finished 45min later tables filled but the place didn t reach capacity. This is a head scratcher  no apologies or acknowledgment for the weirdness of the whole thing and I m chalking it up to being newly opened  but you ve been in business for years . The truth would ve been fine. It looked like a large party reserved the place  big deal.  As for the food  best Mexican in town  The mojo de ajo  mol   tamales  enchiladas  burritos  etc are fantastic. Margaritas could use improvement but saw ones others had that looked better  not murky deep yellow. Only food complaint is  12 guacamole  What   It s maybe one  .79 avocado if you squint. We ve eaten A LOT of guac nation-wide  heck  globally  and that s out of line. Despite the junk  we ll be back  We re 20 year Austinites and some of us are neighbors so this has to work  
Polvo's DT,178,This restaurant is an unending frat mixer serving bad Mexican food with terrible service. If they tell you you ve got a reservation  it s probably fake news. After waiting an hour after our reservation time  they told us that we might have to wait another because  while the table was ready  they couldn t find any chairs. When we finally were sat  it was literally across from a dog sitting in a chair. The sad thing is that this was honestly the best part of the experience.   The food  which we stared at for a bit while waiting for silverware  bordered on edible  2 stars  see  . If you like hanging out with trendily dressed minors bound for West 6th  standing around in a cramped room with them for an hour  and not eating  this is the spot for you.
Polvo's DT,179,Wow  Over-the-top great  The offerings are many and varied -- not by any means standard Tex-Mex. Everything tastes so fresh  The flavors are sharp and spiced just right -- enough to keep you awake  but not to blow you up. Four different wonderful salsas  Great food  great service. Prices very reasonable in view of the selection and taste. This place really excels   Only disappointment  the wine selection was miserable for a restaurant serving such fine foods -- 4 low end reds and 4 low end whites  just like a Chinese place  I know  one is supposed to drink  Ritas and beer with Mexican food. Maybe Tex-Mex  but not this food. Polvo s  at least in this location  needs to find a small selection of very good red and white wines that normally sell for  15 to  20 at local retailers. Buying at their cost  they could offer these bottles at  35 or so and  10 to  12 by the glass.  We will be back many times  Thanks for a great night.
Polvo's DT,180,Awesome local Mexican restaurant with a great vibe. Fantastic indoor and outdoor seating options right on the Shoalcreek. Fun happy hour menu and options. Definitely recommend the queso appetizer 
Polvo's DT,181,First time at this location and really liked the location when it was Garridos.  The lighting in the restaurant is really harsh.  The chili relleno  tortilla soup and nachos were very tasty.  Our waiter was on his cell phone most of the time so it was hard to get his attention.  He also  tacked on his tip on our check at the end.  Luckily someone in our party noticed it.  We said something to the waiter and he just smiled.  I have never been in a restaurant where they put on an automatic tip for a party of FOUR.  Based on that  I would not go back to this location
Polvo's DT,182,Polvos downtown  central is SO good. The tomatillo chicken enchiladas   their pickled veggies at the salsa bar always have us coming back. Great  friendly  and fast service   margaritas that will have you in bed by 9
Polvo's DT,183,We came to Polvo s for dinner on my bachelorette party and had a great time  They were super flexible with our reservation and had our table ready when we got there. The margarita pitchers are definitely the way to go with a big group. Everyone s food was delicious and we especially enjoyed the queso. The service was great considering the large size of our group. I would definitely recommend this place 
Polvo's DT,184,I ve been coming to Polvos for about 6 years now and the overall experience has progressively gotten worse. We made a reservation over the phone at 11 am the day of for a 7pm time. We arrived on time and they told us it would be a 25-30 minute wait. Our waitress came by the table a total of two times throughout our meal and the food was cold as soon as it was served. The staff was rude  inattentive  and unapologetic about the incredIbly poor experience. Strongly suggest you avoid dining at this restaurant. Austin has WAY better Mexican establishments that take pride in service and food quality.
Polvo's DT,185,As an avid Polvos patron living in Austin for years  I have to say this one is HANDS DOWN the worst one. Do not waste your time here. We had a reservation for 12 booked a week in advance. When arrived  we stood around for 30 minutes while the host staff had no idea what to do with a confirmed reservation. There was a fraternity formal who has taken over the entire restaurant and the best they could do was put us in a corner at what they called a  high top . This was nothing more than 4 plastic bar tables slammed together with no room for anything other than chips and a drink. Comical they thought this was accommodating for our party. And 1000  no social distancing of tables anywhere  ours  or the fraternity palooza that was occurring. To top off the night  after horrible service and botching many orders and the bill entirely  I had to wait in line at the bathroom while 3 fraternity members were doing lines of cocaine in the ONE bathroom stall they had. Absolutely horrible experience and I don t recommend going here if it was your only option for Mexican food. Extremely poorly managed and your chances of getting covid here are high to guaranteed.
Polvo's DT,186,Awesome patio. Great tex-mex. The manager is friendly and very service-oriented.
Polvo's DT,187,Food is good but expensive.  The real issue is the salsa bar.  They bring you a bowl of chips but no salsa.  They expect you will buy it   It is silly that they charge  4 for it  but even if you don t go  it will show up on your bill.  They will  apologize  and take is off if you request.  You can tell it isn t an accident by your waiter s reaction to your request to take it off.
Polvo's DT,188,We tried it a few times because we really wanted to like it. However  we get ripped off every single time we go there. They intentionally don t put prices on things that are too expensive. For example  we ordered guacamole and got a spoonful in a large bowl. Assumed we would pay around  7 for it because it was conveniently not listed  It was actually  15    Drinks are watered down and over priced. Feels like a cafeteria atmosphere and the the service is similar to that of your lunch lady.
Polvo's DT,189,We wanted to love this place since it s right next door to where we just moved. Great location  but that s about all. We sat down on the patio and I ordered a house margarita w o salt. She brought it back with salt  and sped off before I could say anything. The margarita was super watered down and didn t have much tequila. Then  a basket of chips were dropped at the table and tasted like they were out of a bag from the grocery. I asked if we get salsa with them  and we were told that the salsa bar costs  4 and it s self serve. Stupid  but we wanted salsa  so we went for it. All 4 salsas were watery and had no flavor. We decided not to roll the dice with anything else on the menu and got our check.
Polvo's DT,190,The peaceful  verdant creekside patio is a great location to enjoy the downtown vibe. I had dinner at Polvos last night with my husband  daughter and 2.5 year old grandchild.  The service was friendly and fast.  The patio is child and pet friendly and a wonderful choice for a family dinner.
Polvo's DT,191,Absolutely horrendous experience. Server refused to split a check...  15 for a small bowl of guacamole  the al pastor quesadillas were tasty but very small serving. Just overall not a pleasant time at all and not worth the money at all. Eat somewhere else  in Austin there is much much better options
Polvo's DT,192,Awesome   Went to the cute little spot when I visited Austin recently. Got a carne asada and shrimp taco per the recommendation of the waiter. It was excellent  Loved their back patron and the service was exceptional. I ll definitely be back 
Polvo's DT,193,Huge ripoff    This location is extremely expensive. You have to pay  4 for the  Salsa Bar  which consists of a few mediocre Salsas and a WEAK bean dip  Gloria s is better . Not to mention the  33 pitcher of tequila mix and ice  don t expect any sort of buzz from this drink. I will say  the decor is beautiful and is much classier than their location on 1st street  but expect to drop some money when going here. Need to split a check  Forget it. NOT recommended for college student.
Polvo's DT,194,My husband and I had a delicious dinner here last night  Our server  Elizabeth  was wonderful and the outside patio was breezy and comfortable on a hot summer night. We shared the chili con queso and the cerveza fajitas and left with a big box of leftovers. We both had several cold beers and the bill was quite reasonable for the area. We will be back for sure 
Polvo's DT,195,Don t make reservations for anything important to you. Polvos will mess it up    I made a reservation 6 weeks prior for a family Christmas party of 15. One week prior I called to confirm. Everything was go to go. As we all show up 10 mins before our reservation Polvos told us it would be a long wait. I told them i had a reservation and confirmed it just one week before. They said they don t take reservations just call ahead. We ended up waiting an extra 45 minutes and seated at two separate tables. Ruined our night.  They did nothing to try to help us out. 5 of our party was under10.    Don t count on Polvos for anything except bad service. Several other parties were also told of a long wait after they made reservations in advance. Polvos will ruin your night. That don t ever care. They treat customers poorly. Just saying -Don t Go there. Way to many other options   My rating is 2 thumbs down    Had to put one star in order to post this review     
Polvo's DT,196,The new location downtown is nice  the service was not so good and the food was okay.  Our waitress did not know which tequila was used as the house tequila.  She did not explain anything about how the salsa bar worked and could not answer basic questions about the menu.  I asked which vegetables were in the vegetable blend used in the enchiladas.  Not only did she not know but she was not inclined to ask.  Her response was simply  I don t know .  I had to ask her if she would find out.   She returned with an answer but it was strange that  as a waitress  she could not provide simple information about the menu items.   We ordered Mex Martinis with Sauza Hornitos  which is a good tequila for margaritas and very possibly an upgrade from the house tequila but its not an expensive  high-end tequila.  You can buy a 750ml bottle of Hornitos for  14.99 at a local liquor store.  Our Mex Martini s were  18 each.  Seriously   We did not see prices listed for cocktails on the menu.  Perhaps Polvos might consider listing  cocktail prices on their menu and or having their waitstaff inform customer of up-charges. At  least then  customers won t be upset with the waitstaff when they get their bill.  Our waitress seemed surprised and unhappy when she looked at her tip but she could not answer basic questions about the menu  and she was not timely.  Aren t tips still earned for good service 
Polvo's DT,197,Too expensive for what you get. Food is ok. Bad service. They added gratuity for a group of 3. I could ve gotten a steak dinner at a NICE steakhouse for what we paid here for FAJITAS. You have to pay for salsa      
Polvo's DT,198,The food is top notch  classy Tex-Mex  and interior Mexican food   My Mole enchilada s were wonderful   My complaint with this establishment is the staff needs to relax around people with disabilities  and especially those with Guide dogs. The Host had to let some people at the bar  who actually knew me  know that I was sitting at the bar next to them with my Guide. Then  when being seated  I was seated at one location  then being moved  because a party was coming  which never showed . When being served  it was with trepidation  like everyone on staff was afraid of my Labrador Guide dog who has not one aggressive bone in his body. I really want to give this place another try  as I thoroughly enjoyed my food  but I m a little bit nervous after the last visit.
Polvo's DT,199,While the Polvos on South 1st greatly exceeded my expectations  the downtown establishment fell short. The power gave out and we were forced to stay and wait 20 minutes. Despite this  management was unable to accommodate our party for this inconvenience. Therefore  I will never be attending this establishment again. Downtown ain t it 
Polvo's DT,200,We went to Polvo s to have a drink and a quick bite. We used a napkin like a normal person and the napkin smelled the rotting sewage. We were so bewild that we didn t want to keep eating because all we smelt was garbage from the napkin so we called the manager Paula over. She dismissed us and said yea this happens all the time and sorry and started blamed someone else...turns out she was the owner.... She made the server pay for our app and didn t want to speak to us any further. Worse serve and worse hygiene and makes me question what else in the place. Yuckkkkkk.
Polvo's DT,201,The food here was really good  the drinks were also yummy. And the atmosphere on the patio  under all the twinkle lighted trees made fir a perfect night. They have a salad bar and you get your own salsa... they were all excellent. Careful though  some were REALLY HOT.
Polvo's DT,202,Less than one star. The service was terrible. A waiter busboy pushed past my daughters nearly knocking them over. They have a salsa bar you have to pay  4 to serve yourself - and the same busboy bumped into me so hard the salsa went flying all over me. The waitress started laughing - watching as I wiped off salsa and the busboy cleaned up some of his mess. She kept laughing as I told her it wasn t funny. I said he really knocked me into the salsa bar and it hurt and got salsa all over me - she didn t care. I said - really  Nothing  No response   She did the   sorry         She only came by our table once - I tried to order a margarita bec she wouldn t come back by our table.  I asked another waitress for the manager bec I thought he should know their salsa bar is in the main thoroughfare for waitstaff rushing out of the kitchen and it s not conducive to a pleasant dining experience and it is not safe for customers.  That other waitress said she d get the manager - but she didn t.  There was a table of bros our waitress was all over and getting service and drinks - no spilled salsa or pushing past the bros - only the mom and two daughters who get zero service and respect and get pushed and shoved out of the way.  When I asked for check it was another five minutes as the waitress stared at from afar tending to the other table  - wouldn t take my card. So I got up to pay up front and asked the other waitress if she got the manager for me - she said.  No  he s right there.  So...no  she didn t.  The busboy who pushed me stared at me and asked me  cannnnnn I helllllppppppp you       as I was waiting for my card back after paying the waitress. I said no.  I told the manager my experience - he stared in silence. As we were walking out he said   I apologize  - really  As we are leaving  I have never in my life not left a tip but this was beyond horrible service. I was pushed  spilled on  laughed at  ignored. From the busboys to the waitresses to the manager.    And the food was not good enough to justify this poor service.
Polvo's DT,203,Clay our server was incredible. He was polite  well informed and on top of his table side manners. Our waters were filled the entire time. He bussed plates out of the way at the right time. I got an enchilada plate and boy was there great flavors going on. My boyfriend go the shrimp fajitas and I was a great serving of yummy cabbage and zucchini amongst other veggies. The minor things I didn t care for much is that the guac was a bit bland and no coasters or bev- napa were put underneath drinks causing a puddle of water on the table. Since its 2018  and good servers are hard to come by I am happy to announce I will gladly be back  
Polvo's DT,204,The best fajitas in Austin hands down. This restaurant has an amazing outdoor seating area that backs up to a downtown creek. Lights are dim but not too dark  definitely a place with a good vibe. The ambiance plus quality mexican food make this our consistent go-to spot downtown. Always the right decision.
Polvo's DT,205,Super friendly staff  very accommodating. Great bartender  nice big deck facing the shoal creek with plenty of shade.
Polvo's DT,206,Awesome food awesome service  Nicole was awesome  great atmosphere and vibe  downtown Austin rules 
Polvo's DT,207,Decent Mexican food. However we were very disappointed in how the service was. They do not tell you that the salsa bar costs  4 or that extra tortillas or chips also adds to the bill. The service encourages you to get the salsa  yet does not disclose the extra charge. Great food  but the experience really made it not worth it. I suggest Matt s or chuys.
Polvo's DT,208,Carne guisada exotic taco was amazing. Great flavor with just the right amount of sauce. Wasn t drowning and wasn t dry. Carne was very tender.
Polvo's DT,209,This is one of the best Mexican restaurant I ve been too in a long time  I love how they incorporate a lot of different flavors and ingredients into their fajitas. They make their tortillas fresh and their house margaritas are good  Next time in town I would definitely be going there and highly recommend if you re in the area please stop by and try the cuisine. Our server Elizabeth was great and attentive and made sure our dog had plenty of water this restaurant is dog friendly 
Polvo's DT,210,We gave the Polvos Downtown three tries. If you want to experience Polvos in Austin  go to the original location on S 1st St.  Living downtown  we excitedly awaited Polvos new downtown location. When it finally opened  there was no fanfare and the hours were limited.  First experience  the atmosphere is clean  white  uniform  and the prices are higher than the flagship restaurant. There is no reflection of Polvos  unique and casual decor  and fun environment. The service was very slow and the staff did not know the menu or food. The drinks were good  but our food was cold.  Second try  again an almost empty restaurant yet the staff was stiff and impersonal. The food was good but our drinks were mediocre.  BTW  by now we had returned to the S 1st St location and they raised their prices to the same as the downtown menu.   Third visit to Polvos Downtown  still hopeful for the experience we are accustomed to at the S 1st St location. Happy that they have extended their hours by now  the restaurant is almost empty. They seat my husband and me in the back at the table closest to the restrooms and by the outside patio door. We ask to move to a different table and they agree  but then we do not see our server for another 10  minutes. We order our drinks and meal. Almost 15 minutes later  our drinks arrive but the house margarita tastes like a mimosa with a salt rim. I complain and they take the existing drink and add tequila and lime - it tastes no better. I did not drink the  margarita  but we were charged fully for it. My husband s Mexican Martini is not up to standard for Polvos. Our food arrives and the grilled flautas are fried  but at least the food is hot. My husband s meal is good  except the rice completely covers the guacamole on the plate. After eating  we wait 15 minutes before seeing our server again.  Bye-bye Polvos Downtown  we will be driving to the S 1st St restaurant.  I will add that at least the escabeche and salsa bar was consistently great at both locations.
Polvo's DT,211,The back deck here is awesome  you feel like you re in a different city. Convenient place for downtown food without a lot of the hassle. Good atmosphere and solid Tex mex food and margaritas.
Polvo's DT,212,best food we ve had in town so far  Chicken enchiladas and quesadillas were AMAZING. Great service too   
Polvo's DT,213,Please do not waste your time or money at this restaurant. We went for Tex-Mex during my Mom s 60th birthday weekend in Austin and it was an absolute disaster. After we finally ordered our meals we waited for over an hour for the food to come to TWO  out of six  of us  while the rest of the meals took another 15 minutes. The first meals were served on piping hot plates with room temperature food  not to mention it was actually cold by the time the other meals arrived.  Once all meals were delivered  we discovered they had completely forgotten my husband s meal and kept asking him what he ordered. At this point  we didn t even want to eat. Once we finally finished the meal  we sat with dirty dishes for at least 20 minutes without one server coming over to clear plates. Even when we asked for a manager she came over to speak to us STILL with dirty plates on the entire table. The manager said she would take care of something on the bill and when we received the bill we saw she took off ONE appetizer. We were so shocked. We requested that the owner call us to speak to us and discount our bill as it was absolutely ludicrous that we should pay full price for such a poor experience.  The owner was supposed to call my dad on the following Monday  we left his phone number and everything  and never did. I have never in my life experienced such a terrible dining experience...let alone on my mom s birthday weekend. Clearly the owner does not care about customers  or he would have called my dad to address the many problems with our experience. As a small business owner myself  I try to make every effort to my sure my customers are taken care of and have an EXCELLENT experience  and when they don t...I make sure it make it right. Absolutely shocked by this restaurant and it s owner.
Polvo's DT,214,We had a terrible experience at the restaurant. The service was sub par and when the server went down for the restaurant we were left waiting for over an hour without any attention from our server. The table was half cleared  there was no offer to get additional drinks or even fill our water glasses. We asked for our check multiple times and were basically told they couldn t do anything. The manager finally came over to our table after 45 minutes of us sitting there and expected us to all write down our FULL credit card information  name and phone number along with our drivers license information for them to keep and then call us when the server came up the next day. In a world of data security being an issue there was no way we felt comfortable leaving that information for them to have at their leisure. We offered a comprise to write down our number and card info without the security code or expiration and we would give it to them when they called to run the card. The manager reluctantly said fine. Then miraculously the server came back up so we stopped writing down the information because we were told they could run our cards. When we asked about being offered a discount for the inconvenience of over an hour wait time and lack of service during that timeframe the manager flat out told us that it was OUR fault we were left waiting because we refused to give them the credit card information. Which was 100  untrue. Coming from working in a service industry job I know first hand there are multiple ways you can handle situations like this. It by no means was their fault the server went down  but how they chose to treat their patrons was beyond ridiculous. The food itself was great  but unfortunately was lost by the terrible service we received.
Polvo's DT,215,Ok  let s  keep this short and sweet. I like Polvos mainly for their frozen margaritas. I had no idea Polvos had a downtown location until I was passing by it and I was suddenly in the mood for a frozen margarita. The food here is not that bad but I mainly come here for their house margaritas. We sat down and got our drinks and they were delicious like always. When I got the bill I couldn t believe that those  house margaritas  were  9 each. The location on S 1st charges  6.50 for a frozen margarita. That is quite a hike in prices given that it s only about 1.5 miles down the road from each other. I also prefer the S 1st location because it gives more of a local authentic Austin vibe. This location is very fancy and upscale completely different from the S 1st location. It has a nice patio and view but it doesn t feel like I m dining at Polvos. I d maybe go back if their prices were more affordable but for now  I ll stick to the S 1st location.
Polvo's DT,216, 3.95 for the Salsa bar and I have to go get it and parade through the restaurant balancing the bowl   I will reduce my tip by  4.00
Polvo's DT,217,Like the S. 1st location  the margaritas and Chile rellenos are the best you ll ever have. Waitstaff and ESPECIALLY the host are Top Notch. Hands down  best TexMex in Austin.
Polvo's DT,218,I concur with other reviewers low rating. We stopped in on a Friday for a margarita. Much to our disappointment it was disgusting. The manager came over and asked to remake which he did but without improvement. When we told him it was substandard he asked for our recipe. When asking questions I was cut off and received eye rolls. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because of the salsa bar. Will not return  
Polvo's DT,219,We loved the South 1st location but had not been in 5 years.  We were excited about the downtown location.   First experience was unimpressive.  Second  try mediocrity.  Last night was three strikes you are out.   The ceviche was a few pieces of fish hidden in a pile of raw onion  yesterday s chopped tomatoes and a few sliced apples.  Not sure who is in the kitchen.
Polvo's DT,220,We wanted someplace for a few margaritas and appetizers. This is the place to go. The queso is awesome  guacamole was really tasty  and the house margaritas are fresh and hit the spot. Elizabeth was our server and was as sweet as can be smiling the whole time and very very helpful. Looking forward to coming back for dinner again soon.
Polvo's DT,221,I tried downtown Polvo s today.  I was surprised at the weak happy hour offerings and the fact that many menu items had no prices.  Margarita was average  on the small side  and cost  7 at happy hour.  Which means it s  9 at other times   Won t rush back.
Little Plaza Tacos,1,We stopped here on our self-guided taco tour of Austin. We ordered the Al Pastor and Campenchano tacos. Both were amazing  Meat was cooked perfectly. Just the right amount of spice and flavor. I would definitely recommend this stop if you re looking for great tacos in Austin.
Little Plaza Tacos,2,Best taco truck in all of austin. Bistec tacos all night baby lesssssssgoooooooooooo.
Little Plaza Tacos,3,Rude. Cashier took my breakfast taco order 3 times and still got it wrong. Instead of correcting her mistake and making the right thing  she offered a refund but wanted the taco back. Then she didn t apologize  but blamed me  trying to pit my friend against me to claim I told her the wrong order. I had to take my tip back because they didn t deserve it.   Oh and the food was nothing special. The only reason this isn t 1 star is because they were able to accommodate my modification for just egg whites on the other order and technically we were there at 1p  but they officially stop doing breakfast burritos at noon.
Little Plaza Tacos,4,This place has the best tacos ever  If you get the bistec tacos  amp  fries w  queso you cant go wrong. Food is 10 10  the service is quick   amp  the workers are super nice    Def my go-to after a long night    
Little Plaza Tacos,5,We stopped here after bar hopping and it looked promising. I order the 3 street taco special Al Pastor  and Mexican Alambre taco. Should have been  9 but she charged me  12  just caught that when I looked at the photo I took of the menu. That s sucks...  The street tacos were a teaspoon of meat and probably the least generous I ve ever had  I wouldn t recommend them.  The Mexican Alambre taco was awesome though  it was really good. Only reason they got 2 stars after stealing my  3 
Little Plaza Tacos,6,Yummmmmy   The prices are so great  we ordered everything on the menu just to try. Let me tell you  everything is delicious     Their barbecoa is delicious  the taco w  bacon is SO good  beef quesadilla is on point. Queso is satisfying  fried chicken taco... omg... should have ordered two    Will definitely be ordering again. Can t beat the prices   quality.
Little Plaza Tacos,7,Let me go ahead and steer you from  wherever your midnight taco run is going to be and redirect you here.  When you look up Mexican authenticity in the dictionary  a picture of Little Plaza Taco will be there waiting for you.  There is no doubt in my mind these ladies working the truck would have relished the opportunity to feed me more and call me mijo. I consider myself a pretty fair Spanish speaker  these ladies spoke such Castilian Spanish  I became lost at the word they chose to use for straw.  Al pastor was tender and SUPER flavorful.  You could have filled a shoe with this stuff and had folks fighting for a bite.  Chicharron surpassed the flavor and texture of the best chicharrones I had as a boy deep in the south of Texas.  Highly recommend this joint.  I wouldn t lie to you.  Then again I was inebriated  but I stand by this review.
Little Plaza Tacos,8,Came here after a night of drinking and was not disappointed...they have around 10 taco options and I wanted all of them   I went with the Al Pastor  of course   the Bistec  and the barbacoa  all of which were delicious  The tacos are pretty sizable and come in these warm tortillas. Many of them have avocado too   Though there are many food trucks to visit in Austin  this would definitely be one I come back to.
Little Plaza Tacos,9,This place was delicious. It s cool because it s located in a little food truck  park  so if there s a group of people there is a variety to choose from in food types. My boyfriend and I went here after a night off bar hopping and it was the perfect place to close the night. I  personally  am a fan of taco trucks and this one impressed me with their fish taco  el pastor tacos  beef fajita burrito  and chips and queso. They also have Mexican Coke which made the meal complete. I didn t get a chance to take pics. I was too busy digging in lol
Little Plaza Tacos,10,Was looking for a late lunch and this was the only truck open  and I am so glad. This is the best Al Pastor I ve had in Austin. I originally only ordered 1 and had to reorder the second one. The homemade tortillas are excellent.
Little Plaza Tacos,11,No joke  the best breakfast tacos I ve had.  Cheap  delicious handmade tortillas  garlicy amazing salsas  generous portions. Hot and fresh ingredients. Came here every morning of my trip-- one of the only trucks open on Mondays and Tuesday s  so glad we stumbled on it. Highly recommend.
Little Plaza Tacos,12,This place is easily one of the best taco food trucks I ve had. If not  the best. Staff is wonderful and kind  Their fried chicken taco is AMAZING  The chicken had a crunchy bite yet melts in your mouth. Slaw on top   the cheese is a great additional. I also recommend their beef fajita   Barbacoa 
Little Plaza Tacos,13,Best tacos ever. You will not regret this. Mr Veggie Taco and The Fried Chicken  The Austin Puffy  are the shittttt. You will thank me later. You re Welcome   
Little Plaza Tacos,14,Soooo good  Really hit the spot for some late night food. Excellent veggie tacos and the salsa was some of the best I ve had. It was very flavorful and had a good amount of heat. My husband really enjoyed his Al Pastor tacos.
Little Plaza Tacos,15,We got the steak quesadilla and it was delicious. More than enough of a portion - it took 2 people to finish ours. The small salad on the side was perfect  Definitely a cherry on top of our trip to Austin 
Little Plaza Tacos,16,Rounded up from 3.5 stars.  Little Plaza is here to cater to your post-imbibing needs. Mexican run  but catering to the young kids around here. Hence the fried chicken taco  the  3 price tag and acceptance of credit cards. But they ve also got you covered with al pastor  alambres  etc. The fillings are tasty  but the tortillas were a little stale.
Little Plaza Tacos,17,Delicious food and the owner was very nice. Would definitely eat here again. I tried 4 different tacos and all were great.
Little Plaza Tacos,18,Got the Mr. Veggie taco. That comes with broccoli  cauliflower  and a type of slaw. Veggies were super fresh and cooked perfect. Plus the corn tortilla was homemade. Super good.
Little Plaza Tacos,19,Unbelievably good corn tortilla tacos. I am skeptical of most food trucks but this place serves the real shit. Pastor  beef fajita tacos....completely flavorful and delicious. The only reason I didn t give 5 star is because the friggin generator is super loud  Ate there again last night  3 27  super delicious     love the food here.
Little Plaza Tacos,20,Good tacos. Had the beef fajita and the talapia here on a plate with beans and rice. Pretty good stuff... decently priced as well... probably better priced than most of the stuff you will see on 6th street in fact. It s not too far from dirty 6th so why not stop on by while on your jaunt downtown  They serve burgers here as well.
Little Plaza Tacos,21,The chicken fajita taco was delicious and the service was awesome  So quick and friendly  The only reason I didn t give them five stars was because my friends really wanted the nachos and they were out of nachos tonight. Definitely would recommend  a stop at this food truck
