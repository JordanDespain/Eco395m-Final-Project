Taqueria Rogel,1,STAY AWAY    The meat on my tacos was completely raw The lady said the burritos were big but it was a lie... the burritos are tiny  same size as a taco when. No avocado  no cilantro  no lime... Horrible  I had to drive back and complain and get my money back.   No COMAN AQUI... Hoy fue mi primera vez que llegue a comer aqui. 1. LA carne de mis tacos estava cruda  2. La Comida estava fria  3. Mi esposa pidio carnitas y Le dieron pollo. No tienen los ingredientes que uno esta acostumbrado a comer  no aguacate  no cilantro  ni limon.
Wicked Kitchen,1,I wanted to go to Perry s for lunch. Nothing available til 2pm  Yikes. Next.  Let s try Turf N Surf Poboy. Eek  look at that line  Next.  Maybe Frank  15 minute wait  Umm...I need to be back at work in 20 minutes at this point.  Hmm  what s this Wicked Kitchen food trailer  No reviews on Yelp  Let s give it a try anyway. Bad idea. This is the last time that I m trying a new food place without any reviews. The menu consisted of 4 noodle or rice bowls- each from a different country. I asked the person taking my order what he recommended. He said the Vietnamese entree was his favorite. Hubs opted for the Indian dish. We were both surprised when our two bowls came out to be almost  18  prices aren t listed on the menu . None of the ingredients seemed to justify the price. Three of the available dishes were chicken and the fourth was pork. We were further disappointed when we saw how tiny the bowls were.   Oh well  maybe they taste good   we thought. Wrong. Oh  we were very wrong. Hubs  bowl was by FAR the worst  Indian  dish we had ever tasted. I thought he was being silly and was exaggerating until I had a bite for myself. My Vietnamese noodle dish was edible but didn t taste a whole lot better. Next time  I ll...ehh  there won t be a next time.
Airport Xpress Market,1,Love this place.  The bathrooms are super clean  When mentioned the cleanliness to Anu and his staff  they told me that the bathrooms are cleaned every 2 hours....I can tell you  it shows  Keep it up  Anu and crew.
Airport Xpress Market,2,Great location. Plenty of parking and allows for you to stop  gas up  buy something to snack on while you are waiting to pick someone up at the airport.
Airport Xpress Market,3,This Convenient store is brand new and very clean. The restroom is modern and clean. They have hot food and a meat market. Check cashing and money transfers  lottery. Plenty of parking unlike down the street.  What else do you need  Oh yeah great service. It seems they are still getting their groove due to this store being new but still nice. Right across the street from the airport.
Airport Xpress Market,4,I like the place all the employees are super nice I go all the time. But 1 employee named Uri on the register  extremely rude on more than 1 occasion. I called to speak with a manager  she said they re unavailable very unapologetic about it. Then I call back 20 minutes later. She says she is the manager  won t tell me her name  admits to not being the manager then hangs up on me. Manager shows up at 3pm evidently.  She needs to cool her jets.
Airport Xpress Market,5,2 out of 3 times they ve been out of receipt paper at the pumps.   I ll give it two stars for the proximity to the airport.
Man vs Fries,1,Looks good. Sounds good. Wait. THIS DOESN T ACTUALLY EXSIST. Every time I order delivery from this place I wait over an hour and it gets canceled. Don t bother attempting to find the physical location because that doesn t exist either. Best troll truck out there. Well done idiots. Ya got me 
El-Regio Taqueria,1,it s a rotisserie chicken with no taste.  big deal. there is a chain of these.  maybe the others are better.
Pollos Asados El Norteno,1,Todo muy rico  Me encanta el lugar  son los mismo de la Traila que estaban en la Texaco. La Traila que est  en la Texaco ahora no son ellos. Aclar  por si hay confusi n
Pollos Asados El Norteno,2,No lo recomiendo se tardan mucho la se ora q me atendi  no paso mi orden para atr s y dos personas q llegaron despu s q yo los despacharon primero q ami y para el colmo de malas la libra de asada ni siquiera era una libra le faltaba mucho para la libra la pese llegando a mi casa los pueden demandar por mentirosos y no vender lo q dicen me siento robada e visto casos de demandas de otras personas por enga ar al consumidor era m s cebolla picada q carne
Chilangos,1,Their breakfast tacos are the same as any others I ve had  but they get an extra star for the impressively fast service. When I need a fast breakfast  I pull in  the guy tells me the 3 kinds he has ready  then he hands me a bag with 3 of whichever I chose for  3. In and out in under a minute.
Man vs Fries,1,I was trying so hard to see resemblance in what I ordered and what was in the pictures that looks good but it s a mess and can t make anything out  it just looks like carne guisada  not like anything in what would of been in my burrito I wanted.
Las Palmas Mexican Restaurant,1,This was probably the worst food experience .its definently not Mexican. We were 6 people ordered food and drinks .the chips and salsa were ok despite the fact the we had to pay for it but the good had absolutely no flavor.  NO FLAVOR AT ALL ....when we complained to the manager he told us that he himself goes else where for Mexican food . He was very rude and unhelpful. The food cost us about 200 usd with tip  and 90  of the food was left on the plate ..if you have good appetite for mexican food dont waste it on this place ....
El Taco Real,1,They charge you  3 for a  1.50- 1.75 taco at most... corn tortilla  i may have broke the bank if i asked for flour... whew  You would think at that cost at least the limes would be fresh... just keep driving a bit further and spend your money elsewhere... I m warning you
Pfajita Gib,1,I stopped by here Thursday evening in hopes of trying something new.. hoping that I wouldn t be disappointed and I WASN T      This BBQ is delicious. Definitely one of the best I ve had in the Pflugerville Austin area. The brisket is exceptional and the flavor of the sausage is unlike anything I ve ever had. I definitely recommend them both   Also  the owner was wonderful and the food was amazing   I will surely be back.
Pfajita Gib,2,I went to buy like I normally do  a young girl taking the money got angry and unprofessional when I ask why the guy making the food was not wearing gloves making the food.  We are in the middle of a pandemic and he s using his bare hands touching everything.  She snaps and says all our hands are clean with a bad attitude then starts speaking in Spanish angrily. Told me if I didn t want the food I can have my money back    Rude  disrespectful  immature  and her mask was slipping off her nose. I will never eat or spend my money here again  I would NOT recommend.
