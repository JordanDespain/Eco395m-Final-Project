Fairways Cantina,1,I am so happy I got to experience Fairways Cantina through an Elite group but I also ordered more than was offered so I am eligible to review the restaurant.   The mixed drinks pack a tremendous punch and are delicious  The John Daly was great  and my favorite  and I got to try the Mo Willy Margarita. It was equally as good.   The salsas are consistently great and they re eloquently made for different palettes and desires. I had the Great White Shark taco and it was incredible.  We got to listen to the owners talk about their passion for this restaurant and I am so proud of them for getting to pursue it with this connection to a golf course.  To be honest  I didn t know this place even existed and I m grateful I live close by 
Fairways Cantina,2,Salsa  Salsa  damn good salsa  I was completely blown away from the delicious  fresh  spicy salsas. They reminded me of the salsa I had in El Paso  it definitely hits differently  Seriously  bottle the salsa and people will come just for that   The food is just as good  if you had to choose a taco I highly recommend the Shooter McGavin taco it is a like a deconstructed Al pastor taco but with pulled pork   The owner is super generous and humble  we will be coming again and again 
Fairways Cantina,3,Try this place next time you are in the Mueller area  Came back after discovering this Cafe was open to the public not just golfers  and it s delicious. Highlights include- the faraway salsa  it s made in house and a new favorite of ours   the shooter McGavin taco  and the pink panther cocktail.   Other great options- the fried fish taco was solid  the quesadilla with a side of queso to dip is delicious  and really all their cocktails are great. They also have can beer  cider and white claw for  6 or can wine. I was told that you can buy a can and take it with you while golfing.  The setting is lovely on a nice day. Shaded porch or indoor seating  and It s fun watching others playing golf while enjoying tacos and cocktails. Very relaxing  I think this is a new go-to for us 
Fairways Cantina,4,Tbh  when I first saw this place on my yelp map  I thought   tacos... at a golf course    But I couldn t have been more wrong. The food here is INCREDIBLE. It s kind of a small menu but everything is so flavorful. Their fish taco is my fav but I also like the pastor and their breakfast items. They have delicious frozen margaritas or you can get em on the rocks. There s a good beer selection. And their patio has a gorgeous sunset view. The owner is crazy friendly and will stop by to see how you re doing. So far  I ve introduced this place to a handful of friends and everyone has loved it.
Fairways Cantina,5,Hidden gem alert  I had been wanting to check out this spot for awhile since it s so close to my home. When I first walked in  I was surprised it was counter service and a lot more casual than I expected. However  the staff  especially Nadia was amazing. The Pink Panther marg was so delicious even though it was premixed. Also  guac and chips were on point. Fries were good but I couldn t really enjoy them since I filled up on a lot of other food. Golf course provided a lovely view. I m sure the sunset would be stellar here. I ll definitely be back 
Fairways Cantina,6,I have been here a few times now. What I love most is the ambience. The sounds of the city and all the road noise disappear on their porch that s cool by fans. The food is good but not remarkable. It s that get away feeling that brings me here. Yes I will go back again and again.
Fairways Cantina,7,Always had a beer here after a round for very reasonable  4 but tried a migas tacos  corn tortilla  today and wow  Was amazing   I put it up there with veracruz and tacodeli which I think are great. And the view from the patio ovsr the putting green and course is fabulous.  This counter service place is clean and has comfortable seating inside and out.  Service is always great too   Red and green smooth salsas are awesone too
Fairways Cantina,8,My husband and I stopped in here on a beautiful particularly warm winter day in December. Thanks  global warming.   We both got margaritas. I settled on the Mo Willy margarita and the hubby got a frozen one. Yummy is all I will say and recommend.   We ordered chips and salsa to share. The salsa per my husband was on the spicier side. I however am immune to spice but I can say it was flavorful.   Overall a nice place to grab a drink and food while you watch people at the driving range area hitting some balls.
Fairways Cantina,9,Anybody who knows me knows that I abhor golfing.  That said  I had a great time dining at the Fairways Cantina and hitting a few balls at the driving range. The food was savory  colorful  and well-priced.  I went at seven in the morning  so drinking a marg seemed a little inappropriate.  I d love to go back and try one 
Fairways Cantina,10,Very disappointed with this place  the kitchen was obviously disorganized which caused a delay in my food and the manager was clearly frustrated and very rude.
Fairways Cantina,11,I did not expect one of my favorite taco places to be on a golf course  The tacos and frozen margaritas alone make me want to book more tee times at Morris Williams.   I m slowly making my way through the menu and my favorite so far is the Green Jacket taco  which is beautifully assembled and features a fried avocado. The picante red salsa is also the perfect amount of spice for me  it s very very spicy  for those who can t tolerate spice . The frozen drinks are also delicious and stronggg. Definitely recommend the frozen margarita or the 19th hole lemonade 
Fairways Cantina,12,Great food  great service and a lovely relaxing environment  The tacos were fresh and flavorful. The frozen cocktails are strong and fantastic with a tajin rim. Great view of the golf course. They open early so it was the perfect stop before heading to the airport 
Fairways Cantina,13,What an awesome spot  I wouldn t have thought a golf course would have such a good place for a bite. The fish taco was amazing and tasted so fresh. Elote was absolutely delicious. We happened to catch happy hour and certain drinks were  2 off. They were also spot-on. The views and outside seating area were so great too. Friendly staff. I d love to swing back by here when I m the area 
Fairways Cantina,14,Love the owners.  Cool young people with a great vision to add value to the golf course.  Food is simple but tasty  Plenty of parking Clean restrooms And a great sitting view of the course. Only issue is extreme weather and not enjoying sitting out but that s not their fault  lol
Fairways Cantina,15,Best Migas in Austin. Hands down. The food is incredibly good  the staff kind and enthusiastic  frozen drinks stiff and delicious  not too sweet   and the gold course views are great. We live in University Hills and this place has become our favorite  secret  brunch spot.
Fairways Cantina,16,Wow I m so glad that I found out about Fairways Cantina through the neighborhood fb page. Finding the Cantina was a little difficult because Apple maps led us astray  but it s located next to the golf range so just take the entrance to the course. We ordered online and received our food in around 15 minutes. Be careful of their hours as they close pretty early. They have really great outdoor seating that faces the golf course and we will definitely be back for brunch with a view.  We ordered the Green Jacket  Merry Mex  Street Elote  a Frozen Margarita  and a 19th Hole Lemonade. All were really great but be prepared for the kick in the elote. It was a lot spicier than expected. I recommend looking at their website menu for descriptions of their food instead of the online ordering system as it is a little more accurate.
Fairways Cantina,17,My favorites are the Cantina Fries and the migas taco. Everything is fresh and delicious.  The patio has beautiful plants and is a wonderful spot to hang.
Fairways Cantina,18,Great place to stop in for  breakfast or lunch. Love the avocado and the fish tacos. Everything we have had so far has been delicious. The place is clean and has a friendly atmosphere without the usual Austin parking issues.
Fairways Cantina,19,These tacos are amazing. Queso is great  Margaritas are freaking fantastic   Love this place and you can watch people play  Great views   Love it  I need to visit more often tbh 
Fairways Cantina,20,Great view  drinks and tasty tacos. A find. Don t have to be a golfer or even care about golf to enjoy this place.
Fairways Cantina,21,Gorgeous patio    Please improve your drinks - they re pricy and kind of gross but very strong. I want to love this place  I just need more cocktail options 
Fairways Cantina,22,Took a women s golf clinic class here and it was great  It was a group lesson with an experienced coach who was able to show us the basics and give tips as we practiced.
Fairways Cantina,23,Total hidden gem. The frozen margarita is on point  the food was surprisingly good  and the patio is a wonderful place to sit and relax for a while.  Plus the women s golf clinic they put on was wonderful .
Fairways Cantina,24,I can t get over what a brilliant idea this place is  Colleen s is one of our faves and the owners have carried over their talent to this cute  bright taco spot. I went for lunch recently and had a safe  seamless lunch. I had the fish taco and carne asada taco and both were excellent  really  like very very good  and also tried the guacamole  which was exceptional. I also got a hot coffee  which was Bartlett s and delicious.   Great  quick service and a beautiful  fun location  watching the golfers and trees in the distance. Parking was plentiful  though also very walkable  and sitting outside on the covered porch was a delight. Like I said  can t get over how brilliant this place is 
Fairways Cantina,25,The tacos here are awesome and the outdoor seating  especially during sunset  can t be beat.
Fairways Cantina,26,I really appreciate that Fairways Cantina has been organizing clinics to bring women golfers together. The clinics are great but in addition to that  the staff are always so friendly and out of all the municipal courses in Austin  they serve the best food and drinks by far  
Fairways Cantina,27,My wife and I love going here to have margaritas and hang on the patio. It s a great place to wind down at the end of the week or for happy hour any day  way more chill than fighting downtown traffic  with food and drinks on point. We ve tried every taco and were super pleased  but we re especially big fans of the migas  I try them everywhere I go  and these are some of my fave in town  and the Happy Gilmore  plus guac with the brilliance of adding pickled onion and pumpkin seeds. The menu isn t huge  but it s clear they put thought and execution into what s there. Service has always been quick and reliable when we ve been. I also appreciate their protective efforts in COVID times.
Fairways Cantina,28,Bummer  We live in the area and had high hopes. Tried the queso and these tacos  the Merry  the Happy  the Shark and the Green Jacket. We found the food to be bland industrial food service Sisco quality. Everything  including the queso  had very little flavor and an odd texture consistency. On the plus side  the hot salsas really are hot and we liked the flavor of the mild salsa. Otherwise  skip this place in terms of food.
Fairways Cantina,29,I have been out to Fairways Cantina twice now.  Both times with my family because it seems irresponsible to eat with other people right now.  The atmosphere is pretty great.  It sits above the golf course with nice views from the patio seating.  The guacamole is exceptionally good.  The tacos  tortas  and quesadillas are also very good.  We have kind of eaten family style both times we have been there and everything I sampled was really good.  This is a great addition to our neighborhood.    They also had good Covid procedures in place  it all felt as safe as things can these days.  We will definitely be back.
Fairways Cantina,30,I m not a fan of big crowds in the downtown hot spots so it s nice to have a new option with plenty of 1  free parking 2  outdoor seating 3  tacos and margaritas. Two Happy Gilmores  delicious carne asada  with their excellent guacamole and a margarita is the OTO  one true order. You can get a floater on the margaritas  and while the default is frozen  you can ask for it on the rocks. It s a great sized drink for the price. The quesadillas are a sleeper hit here  they make a good sharing option of you want to try a little of everything.
Bummer Burrito,1,This place has never disappointed  we ve tried the Fritos burrito  the breakfast burrito and the bummer burrito. I add avocado and sour cream the the Fritos burrito which is sooo good. They are pretty quick but I recommend with ordering online before hand. There is a drink place right next store that we ve been wanting to try but haven t gotten around to it. The staff are very friendly and the vibes are great  
Bummer Burrito,2,By far best burritos ever  And it s on Rainey St of all places.  The staff her are awesome and cool  I honestly wished I had a stress free job like theirs. You walk into the building to order your food and drinks. Then you go wait outside by the food truck. They will yell your name out when your order is ready.  Be ready for a heavy bag of burritos if you ordered more than three. LoL  Parking is limited street curb parking or parking garage that is around the corner down the street.  Outside seating area has no covering  so on a hot day be prepared for the heat or on a cold freezing day. Either way get your burrito to go if you re not willing to enjoy the weather outside.
Bummer Burrito,3,Hands down the best breakfast burrito I ve ever had. I got bacon  my fianc  got chorizo. We forgot to take a pic until the end because it was so good. This one isn t spicy at all  I m super sensitive to hot foods. No bueno. But this burrito  I may dream about it. Great flavor  massive in size and yummy all around.   Took me a second to realize how to order. You need to walk into the coffee shop bar right next door  it s called Little brother. They take your order and then you wait outside for the truck to serve up your food.
Bummer Burrito,4,Great burritos  I was in Austin for work and decided to try this place. They are attached to a small bar. Great food  beer  and conversations.
Bummer Burrito,5,Really enjoyed our tasty burritos from here  perfectly toasted wrapper. There s a few 15 min parking spots so you can pickup your order  or if you order in person at the food truck  you can walk around a bit while you wait.  Our order took about 10 minutes for 2 burritos. Would recommend  really enjoyed my breakfast burrito here.
Bummer Burrito,6,Definitely one of if not the best California burritos in Austin. That said  it s super pricey for what you get. We got the bummer and added carne Asada which ended up being a  12 burrito. The tortilla is great and the asada was tasty but everything else in the burrito was meh. I couldn t imagine paying  10 for that burrito without asada - there s not much else in there except some beans and lettuce.  The saving grace was the bean and cheese. Super good and actually worth the cost. I d go back for the bean and cheese and to try their breakfast burrito.
Bummer Burrito,7,Still the best breakfast burrito I ve had. The trashbrowns made all the difference  along with the sauce. I went back twice after they switched to home fries  and although it s still good - I miss the trashbrowns 
Bummer Burrito,8,This was one of the best breakfast burritos I ve ever had  My husband had their breakfast burrito add bacon and sausage  and I had the breakfast burrito add vegan chorizo. Will be back every time we come back to Austin 
Bummer Burrito,9,I used to love their breakfast burritos and recommended them to everyone. However  the last two times I have ordered from them the burritos have been dry- and I ask for extra bummer sauce. No sauce in the burrito. I ask for sides of bummer sauce. I get home- no sides of bummer sauce  they charge you for this too        They also changed their trash browns to house fries. This also has significantly contributed to the dry factor.   I pulled out ketchup and tried to get through my burrito before giving up and throwing it away.   They stole my money and gave me a subpar product. Extremely disappointing.
Bummer Burrito,10,Hate to be cliche but the burritos from here are definitely a bummer. The service is too. I echo a prior review about how little meat they use. My husband and I were basically eating tortilla and lettuce. We had asked for extra hot sauce to which we were abruptly told  it s in the bag . There were 2 small packets of cholula and something literally called  hot sauce . This was definitely not enough. I can t even really begin to describe the customer experience. It was as if they really didn t want us to be there. I walked in and was waiting to be acknowledged and the person behind the bar said  I have two ears. You can say your order and I ll hear you.   Bizarre experience. Won t be back.
Bummer Burrito,11,BUMMER BURRITO AINT NO BUMMER YALL    This has been such a clutch during quarantine days  It s connected to Better Half  if you know  you know.  They have one of THE best breakfast burritos in town  Trust me  I m a breakfast burrito coniseeur and I ended up ordering these burritos 3x   every Sunday  My partner and I couldn t resist  They also have Rad beverages that you can tag on because they are connected to a bar. The mixology is on point.   It s truly about that BUMMER sauce  It s tangy and delicious and makes every burrito better. If you want to mix things up  jalape o popper burrito is on FIRE     So damn good.   Can t wait to order another Rito on our Sunday tradition         review based on delivery
Bummer Burrito,12,Bummer Burrito makes an absolutely first rate burrito.  Make that an outstanding burrito.  Bummer Burrito is a burrito truck sponsored by the highly regarded team who opened the Better Half.  Bummer Burrito may also be one of the very few opening restaurant food trucks that is not significantly hurt by coronavirus.  Talk about total luck.         Bummer Burrito   Great Food in a Terrible Location.  The food truck is located in a tunnel driveway of the mega-apartment complex at Rainey Street and Driskill.  The good news is that there are nine hundred zillion potential customers in their very own building and in the buildings of the giant luxo apartment complexes nearby.  The bad news is that the tunnel driveway is awful and depressing as hell.  Think the approach tunnels to the Lincoln Tunnel leaving New York and you will know what I am talking about.  Oppressive grey cement.   A concrete ceiling with industrial lights that loom over you.   Giant trash bins right behind the food truck.   You know the garage where the mob boss takes the hero to cut his hand off   This is what we are talking for location.    Bummer Burrito is allied with the Little Brother Bar - a leftover back-space in the Rainey-Driskill apartment complex.  They didn t need an office for a garage supervisor  so they turned the supervisor s space into a bar.  It is probably the least appealing bar-space on Rainey Street.  And I don t like most of the bars on Rainey Street to begin with.  The space is too small to host a serious array of beverages.  Indoors is not a nice space to sit.  Outside  they have three postage stamps worth of sidewalk and a metal railing with a shelf to hold your drink.  What a perfect setting to have a soulful conversation with the woman you love    Cough cough          I assume the Better Half people could not cut a deal with any of the other bars on Rainey Street - so they had to settle for what they could get.  They are counting on the excellence of the cuisine to compensate for the miserable quality of the space.  The burritos are so good here that they may just win their bet.         Side Comments  a  The menu is small but full of attractive vegan options.   They make five kinds of burritos - and any of them can be made   all-porkaholic or   all-purely-angelic-and-no-one-even-milked-a-cow.  The menu design is a good call in Austin where every third door shelters a vegan.  b  They play Norteno on the sound system.  In the epicenter of Yuppie Austin    tech financiers walk their  900 Afghan hounds   while wearing Lululemon s top of the line yoga pants.  In that kind of company  regional Mexican music sounds hollow.  Just put on Jimmy Eat World or Radiohead and let it go at that.  c  Knowing that the reputation of the food truck is going to be made or broken on how well it does during the coronavirus outbreak    They do a helluva job wrapping their burritos to survive the takeout trip home.  My burrito was thickly wrapped in foil not just once but twice  covered with a napkin and then put in a paper bag.  The burrito was piping hot when I got it home.  It had lost very little from its time on the grill.         Overall  this is a fine fine food truck.  I hope they make it.  Better yet  I hope they make it and   They knock some of the mediocre food trucks on Rainey Street out of business.   Yeah  that s a nasty thing to say ...  But Rainey Street really does need a major food upgrade.  Just because you are not eating at Emmer and Rye shouldn t mean you have to be poisoned.  Bummer Burrito is fighting the good fight.
Bummer Burrito,13,Nothing bummer about these burritos  y all.   I live upstairs and this is the best food truck to happen to Rainey Street.   The breakfast burrito is phenomenal. The food is piping hot  fresh  delicious. They are doing a killer job during this crazy covid time with social distancing ect. Nothing but two thumbs up and a happy tummy here.
Bummer Burrito,14,Holy shit  This is the first good burrito I ve had since coming from the west coast. The bean and cheese is exactly how I would  special  order mine with enchiladas sauce at taquerias. I ve noticed it s a super cool thing it Texas to have hot lettuce in your tacos and burritos but that s just not my thing. I added the carnitas to my bean and cheese and was epicly stoked  Solid little spot and will most definitely be coming back. Keep it up dudes 
Bummer Burrito,15,Went there for their advertised Tuesday bogo. What they failed to mention is that you have to buy a cocktail first to be eligible- no worries  I m happy to support small businesses during covid. Until I paid  9 for a tiny cocktail can you could prob buy at Walmart for  2. Whatever  drinks are always inflated  right   Next comes the asada bummer burrito. Got home and dug in. Damn thing probably had 1 oz of meat. Might as well advertise it as a lettuce burrito.   False advertising and cheaply made burritos food isn t the way to win anyone s support  pandemic or not.
Bummer Burrito,16,Had the breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint. Best breakfast burrito I had so far. It had the right amount of everything  10 10 recommend.
Bummer Burrito,17,OMG SO GOOD I AM SO SHOOK    The service was great and I am from California... these breakfast burritos are just as good if not better   They are so big and fill you up  I will DEFINITELY be coming back soon 
Bummer Burrito,18,Love the burritos here  The breakfast one is my favorite.    The jalape o popper one is quite good too with asada.  The vegan one is good for vegan food but the breakfast burrito and torta are delicious. This place has early closing hours during covid so get here before 3pm.
Bummer Burrito,19,This place is phenomenal   My go-to after drinking on rainy. We got the bummer burrito plus chicken and a veggie quesadilla. Chipotle who    Couldn t recommend this place enough 11 10
Bummer Burrito,20,The burgers at this place packs a big punch in a small package. In short their burgers are good as hell.
Bummer Burrito,21,AWESOME burritos here.    I ve been craving a good burrito for awhile and some Yelp searching led me to Bummer Burrito.  I ordered online for pickup  which was super smooth and easy.  My husband tried the Bummer Burrito with chicken and I tried the Breakfast Burrito with beans and avocado.  We both loved what we got  so much so that my husband was ready to go straight back and order another one.  They are STUFFED and definitely very filling  so one was more than enough for me.  That being said  even though I was full  I ate every last bite because it was that good.  The ingredients were hot and fresh and the tortilla was perfect for keeping all of the filling in  not to mention tasty on its own.  I don t know what is in the Bummer sauce  but I loved it and wished I had ordered extra.  When I have a burrito craving again  Bummer Burrito is definitely where I ll be heading 
Bummer Burrito,22,Wonderful spot at the top of Rainey street. Great music and fun food selection. Paired with Little brother s eclectic bar menu makes for a great stay to have some wonderful conversation and people watching. The quesadilla was fantastic  with fresh vegetables and delicious stringy cheese. I can t wait to come back for breakfast 
Bummer Burrito,23,Love this place. The bummer burrito is the best. I love that they are open even when the other trucks on Rainey aren t open. They have adult beverages too.
Bummer Burrito,24,This place has very rude staff. The two men I interacted with were yelling and have very little patience. Maybe their attitude has something to do with the screamo music blasting both in the bar area and outside. This place truly is a bummer.
Bummer Burrito,25,This place has a great location and Amazing burritos  COVID friendly and great outdoor seating 
Bummer Burrito,26,It s a  7 burrito sold for  11  assuming you add some type of protein . Is it good  Yeah pretty good. Is it great  No. You re paying that extra  4 to have cute marketing  trashbrowns  shrettuce  etc  and for the opportunity to eat it on Rainey when you ve been boozin - in which case you ll also probably give it 5 stars.
Bummer Burrito,27,What a pleasant surprise   We were stuffed but had to try some of their snacks while we had a drink at little brother  so happy we did  The queso was my first real queso experience and it was delicious  I literally couldn t stop eating it. We also tried the veggie quesadilla  also great. It had zuchini  mushrooms ans onions inside with lots of great cheese and seasoning. Definitely recommend stopping by and trying this place  we will be back to try the burritos
Bummer Burrito,28,The bummer burrito with asada was excellent. The grill gave it a great flavor and ever so slight crispness. But that creamy cilantro jalapeno     green sauce is what dreams are made of. I wish I had more of it  I d put it on everything.
Bummer Burrito,29,The vegan burrito here is the bomb. I thought I was in heaven. Please come check this place out and grab a beer from Little Brothers while you wait for your food. Nice little outside seating and staff is great  Can t wait to overnight here again and have another.
Bummer Burrito,30,Worst experience I have ever had. Burrito is complete trash. Reached out to them via Instagram  and whoever runs their social media account is extremely rude. They should be fired frankly. Will never go here again. These other reviewers are obviously paid.
Bummer Burrito,31,The burrito was delightful  Got the breakfast burrito with bacon  did not disappoint. Great spot if you re looking for a quick bite.
Bummer Burrito,32,I m not sure how this place has good reviews  but this is prob some of the worst tasting food and worst service. Fortunately  being on Rainey St  I m sure this place won t last long. Do yourself a favor and eat anywhere else 
Bummer Burrito,33,My girlfriend and I were craving breakfast burritos and came across this place and let me tell you it does not disappoint  We both got breakfast burritos with eggs  bacon  hashbrowns   cheese and avocado and they were so good  We will definitely be ordering more food from this place  I highly recommend it.
Bummer Burrito,34,This place is legit   Burritos  chip and salsa  and the green hot sauce was on point    Staff was cool too   Wish they made sweet tea 
Bummer Burrito,35,One of the best spots on Rainey. The burritos have great flavor  texture and the portions are huge. The Bummer sauce really brings everything together perfectly with the right amount of tanginess._
Bummer Burrito,36,The best breakfast burrito you will ever have  I live in North Austin and drive down here just for this. Pro tip  order online  then drive and pick it up. Way faster 
Bummer Burrito,37,I m impressed. We ve ordered from them a couple of times  and liked each item we got. The burritos are grilled _just_ right  the queso s good  the lettuce is crunchy  the proteins are flavorful. The place is definitely punching above its weight. Give  em a try. Add queso  and avocado to your burrito.  - 
Tres Amigos,1,I really appreciate the service we receive here. I come regularly with a large group  and the restaurant accommodates us easily. Our chips and salsa stay filled  our food comes readily  and we are never pressured to leave.  The grilled and fajita chicken are seasoned well. Vegetables are fresh. Love the different sauce options.  They have good in-house cocktails  but bring a designated driver because you may find yourself overibiding.
Tres Amigos,2,In austin it is hard to find reasonable priced Mexican food like you were able to years ago. This place is always consistent  pricing is good. Great for groups. We eat there with friends all the time. I gave 4 stars because sometimes the food can be a little inconsistent but I take that as new staff. We can always get seating w normally with no wait  because the place is so big
Tres Amigos,3,I ve defended this place for years. But the reality is that their prices are ridiculous for what you get. The value is just not there.
Tres Amigos,4,Food is very good  server is excellent but  I m so sorry your manager had to yell at me and take away my coffee at lunch today.  Previously my friends and I enjoyed our meals for the food and careful service. He had given me a very stern warning  and a bit of a scare  so I promised them I would not come back and bother your manager  again.  Very sincerely...
Tres Amigos,5,This place was empty when we walked in and that should have been my first clue.  The food was mediocre at best.  The kids meal was what appeared to be a frozen Costco or Sysco staple. My entree reminded of the tacos you would get at a Mexican restaurant in Europe where they can t get the fresh Mexican ingredients and just make it with what they have.  Go to any of the other Mexican restaurants on the east side if you are craving Mexican food.
Tres Amigos,6,Went in for a late lunch today.  Service was good but food came out warm. I guess maybe they did not have the help they needed in the kitchen. I don t know if I can go back knowing that they didn t care what they were serving. This has been a favorite place for years but wasn t worth it today  the cold beans and cold queso puffs ruined it.  One other point is that they have a nice dining room but if you go in any time after the lunch hour they stick everyone in the bar which I ve never cared for but food made up for it. Owners need to have the restaurant to serve their customers  not themselves and the staff.
Tres Amigos,7,Came in solo for lunch to do some sketching - had a tattoo appointment coming up  amp  I asked for a booth with good lighting. There were 3 opened booths but he would only sit me at a table with no window. He as incredibly rude. I would have gladly waiting 5 minutes for someone to clean A TABLE. It was my first time to try you  amp  I ll never go back.
Tres Amigos,8,Eaten here a few times.  Place is nice  service is always good and the Chili Rellenos topped with raisins and almonds is incredible.
Tres Amigos,9,Food is really good but portion size incredibly pathetic.  Must have gotten 3 small pieces of beef and 3 pieces of chicken in my combo fajitas.  What the h  l is going on   Was never like this before and I ve frequented Tres Amigos for many years.  I get pandemic and all  but if I eat out and pay good money  I expect to take some leftovers home and make more than two tacos from a full skillet of Fajitas     I ve noticed this trend at many Austin restaurants lately and most aren t hurting for business based on the insane amount of customers and long wait times   
Tres Amigos,10,You know I think I ve found me a new spot..Tres Amigos was super yummy today  amp  totally hit the spot    The Tortilla Soup was soooooo good  It had plenty of flavor  amp  chicken    I also had a Mexican Martini which made me feel a little bit prettier  amp  the tres leches was really good    I also had their homemade mango ice cream  amp  sopaipilla..both were delicious  amp  fresh    Tres Amigos I think you re my new BFF.   -Rebecca out
Tres Amigos,11,I use to eat at this restaurant all the time for years.  I haven t been there for about 3 years and ordered what I usually would get.  I was not happy with the food and the management seemed different and cold.   I am disappointed and will eat my enchiladas from some of the other tex mex restaurants I use.  I also got something in my bag that seems like ranch dressing.  I am not sure how it was suppose to be used on my order.  I will pass next time.
Tres Amigos,12,Well I work near here  and have come about a year ago. So i thought id give it another shot. I ordered the house frozen margarita my friend order on the rocks and we also ordered an appetizer. We picked a booth near the bar area  and as you sit be careful it s a very hard seat and not very much room between table and booth.   So let s get to the drinks review. Which btw was the main reason going to unwind a bit on a budget. As I remembered great little glass for  5 bucks can t beat it. We both have 2 drinks each and split the appetizer plate of taquitos. Drinks not bad  taste was tart but did the job. Wouldn t say I d go back just for the great tasting margaritas. The food was good. No real complaints about the food.   Prices  that s what made my jaw drop.  40 for 4 small shot glass size Rita s. Drinks were  6.99 each. Oh hell no  I ve have many margaritas and that my friends was true Price Gauging  I won t be back
Tres Amigos,13,Came here with a large group this past weekend and we were treated so well  We were sat in their big back room and the service was fantastic   The chips and salsa were fast and flowing and all of us were imbibing on their  3.95 mini-marg special. Though in the shorty glass  whether frozen or on the rocks  you are getting a tequila bang for your buck with these  They were surprisingly well made and light on the sour mix  which is usually why I avoid discounted margs  but these were great   I got the  Build Your Own Combo  platter since a good friend said that was her go to and I was not disappointed  I got a chicken flauta w salsa verde and a beef enchilada w jalape o crema w rice and a guac salad  amp  queso cup. For  10 and change  this was a decent amt of food and it was delicious  As someone who tends to avoid Tex Mex  this food was made well.  I loved the decor and ambiance and can see myself coming back when I m in the mood for a good  cheap marg and a filling meal 
Tres Amigos,14,Good food  friendly folks  and pleasant conversation - an all around great time.  The  3.95 house margaritas didn t not help the cause.  Brunch menu nachos enticed  consequently  my appetite was satiated.  Thanks for setting this up  Rory  amp  Nickie.
Tres Amigos,15,2021 April 17th was a great dining experience. Easy to tip the staff. We picked the 30  mark the last time we went. Two specials like the Carne Guisada Enchiladas and also the  name   Three Enchiladas  Each Different from Each Other in filling and sauce  are both excellent. The waiters and waitresses are kind and thoughtful too. This is the only Tres Amigos in Austin. I have been to all of the ones over 18 years.  Relaxed dark  but well kept and clean atmosphere too. The masks and paper menu make things more safe too. Enjoy it 
Tres Amigos,16,This place has  apparently  undergone management ownership changes over the many years it has stood at its current location. As such  it has been many restaurants with the same name  some good  some bad.   Currently  it s not great  and I won t be going back until the middle of next year  maybe.   While their fairly spicy food is OK for some  being sensitive to pepper  I need a few things done to most of their Mexican dishes. No big deal  I need the black beans rinsed in a sieve to get the peppery liquid off of them. Takes ten seconds. I need plain guacamole. Takes ten seconds to mash an avocado. I need plain rice with cilantro on the side. Takes five seconds to place a scoop of plain rice on my plate  and another five seconds to chop a little cilantro. So  my dishes take about a half-minute to prep  before they re served to me.   In the past  my wait staff people have been cool  Everything I ordered was great. Two weeks ago  my waiter was a royal butt head  He was grumbling as I gave him my order  with my special instructions. He brought out the regular beans and said that was what I could get. I sent them back  and when he gave me the correct order  he said    This time  only. Never again   Excuse the eff out of me  Yeah  the place had six customers  as it has had most of this year  when I ve gone in. I m sure the cook is too busy texting his girlfriend from the kitchen  Also  I was charged  twice  for the beans  and rice  which were also screwed up.   The manager voided the extra charges  so that was fine. That got them the second star.   I wrote to the management team asking if things would be better  next time. I never heard back from them. Never again  You bet  I won t be back for a good while. Hopefully  a new manager and staff will be working  by then.   NOT RECOMMENDED  at this time.
Tres Amigos,17,This place is good  but not great. We ended up trying this as we live relatively close  and have been here twice because we wanted to give it another shot.  Food Drink  The first time we came here  we got the carne asada plate  and it was ok. Definitely over cooked and chewy. However  the sides were pretty good as well as the drinks. The second time we came we tried the enchiladas and sat in the bar area rather than the main dining room. It was a little better experience and the enchiladas were much better than the carne asada  but still pretty heavily drenched in cheese.  Ambiance  Definitely nothing fancy by any means  but a nice traditional feel.  If you are looking for some traditional Mexican food in Austin and for a reasonable price  this isn t a bad option  but there are better options for traditional Mexican food in Austin.
Tres Amigos,18,I ve been here a couple times now and the food is always great. Two of the times I was there for large parties and they were well equipped to serve us. Good drinks. Lots of space. I like that you can customize your enchiladas with filing and sauce choice  and they give you three huge enchiladas. I tasted my friend s fried  stuffed avocado and it was AMAZING. Literally the best one I ve ever had. Their queso is on point too. I could easily eat a whole bowl and only mildly regret doing so. They have a large bar area with TVs so you can catch your sports games here.
Tres Amigos,19,This review is for take-out only  as we just discovered this place during the pandemic. It has become our go-to for takeout Mexican food. The people on the phone are always super friendly and our food is always ready within 20 minutes and tastes fresh and delicious  5 stars  for Tres Amigos 
Tres Amigos,20,Showed up with a large group for a pregame happy hour and they were very accommodating.  The food and drinks were great and the staff was friendly and efficient 
Tres Amigos,31,Very good food. I was surprised it wasn t packed  Also had a great server. Very great with wearing a mask and gloves. Will go back.
Tres Amigos,32,Would be less than 1 star if possible. They don t listen and try to say that s is not what you said. Confrontational.
Tres Amigos,33,I thought the place was clean  very hungry and was greeted warmly.  Nice environment food was beautifully delicious.
Tres Amigos,34,The service was good  the food was terrible.   I NEVER write yelp reviews  but felt compelled to write this one. The enchiladas were inedible and the chalupas had turned to mush by the time they got them to me.   It was overall pretty gross.
Tres Amigos,35,Came here today for a coworkers going away lunch. The place was pretty empty at 11 45a but I chalked it up to everyone else having the day off and being at home in bed instead of having to work like me.   It was cold in the restaurant. Chips were okay  salsa was good. I ordered the tamales. I m not a bean person so I asked the waiter if they had Mexican corn but he seemed confused by my question. I know that s a thing right  I ended up just getting double rice. Carbs for the new year   The tamales were okay. They were a little dry but the sauce on top was good. I d probably try something else next time. I d give this place another shot but probably won t go out of my way to eat here.
Tres Amigos,36,The margaritas are why we go to Tres Amigas. The only place the frozen house ones are reminiscent of the ones Jorge s  was in Austin in the 80s  served. Not too sweet and not too weak.
Tres Amigos,37,A friend suggested this place this weekend.  We were hanging out and decided to order lunch. What a great idea   The food arrived quickly and was delicious. I am most certainly a fan 
Tres Amigos,38,Horrible that they NEVER EVER play spanish music. It s like old retirement people music. Have requested for years that they do something about that. Is so horrible  listing to that music  I dont even go anymore even though I like the food. Step up your playlist and business will pick up  I promise. Who wants to go to a Mexican restaurant and listen to old nursing home music. Get some mariachis on the weekends. The drinks are good if u go on Sunday margaritas are cheaper. Ambiance is lacking not the feel of a Spanish restaurant they attract more of a Lubys crowd.   Also. Time for a renovation. Who has carpet in a restaurant  Old dirty smelly carpet. Needs to be replaced with better flooring like large tiles.
Tres Amigos,39,Did not like the pick up order I had on 9 9 2018 Ordered 2 tortillas soups large and the quail jalape o poppers. The soup was all rice and hardly any chicken or veggies... it was salty and cold. The quail poppers were only 5 pieces for 12 dollars and change and they were also cold. Been here in the past and never had an issue but yesterday we were not pleased at all.
Tres Amigos,40,Wow. We had a great experience for lunch. This location has been here for a long time. My family would come here many many years ago when I was a kid. The place hasn t changed much. The food was delicious. I really enjoyed the salsa. Kinda spicy  which we love . Chips  were fresh. Our server was a great older man. He did a fantastic job. I got the cheese enchilada dinner with the Chile gravy. Yummy. My husband got the puffy taco  beef enchilada  tamale  guac.  rice and beans. He really enjoyed it. I had a bite of the tamale and guac and they were delicious. It was nice to come back after all these years. We will return.
Tres Amigos,41,What an absolute GEM    The fajitas and mex marts are killer and  for my vegetarian friends  there are so so so many vegetarian options  including their house rice and beans and a poblano cream sauce that will blow your mind.   Swing in the next time you re craving happy hour or some mom and pop Tex-Mex dinner that isn t trying to sell you a logo shirt at the door 
Tres Amigos,42,Always delivers with a quick and tasty lunch. Wait staff is extremely friendly. The flautas are so delicious as well  as the fantastic puffy tacos. The chips and salsa are delicious also.
Tres Amigos,43,For as long as this place has been there I was shocked to find that their lunch hour isn t as packed and busy as surrounding places.  Their service has been nothing but great on my 2 visits. As for the food. My only complaint is in my opinion I find it a tad bit pricey for decent Mexican food. The decor and environment of the restaurant is warm and inviting. Noise level is minimal which makes it a great place to visit with friends over one of their delicious margaritas.
Tres Amigos,44,The tortilla soup was hella salty . Would of been perfect if it wasn t for too much salt.  The veggie enchiladas were really sour. Too much lime. These are ingredients that can easily be added by the customer  to taste and not the cook.   Had a hibiscus water. It contained white tylenol looking particles.  Not sure what that was   but I only withstood 2 sips before I swapped to a regular bottled coke.  In overall. Somewhat satisfied
Tres Amigos,45,I really want to like this place  I do.... But the last couple of times I ve gone the service has been slow. The food takes so long to come out - and it s not even THAT busy. The servers are very nice  but just take too long to tend to the customers.   Perks  Salsa is delicious and spicy.  The tortillas are fresh and buttery.  The queso shell is AWESOME.  Food is consistent - service is not.   I just wish the service was a little better..
Tres Amigos,46,We drove from south east Austin to try Tres Amigos .. there was about 7 empty tables and 3 booths and they would not seat us just my husband and I .. they said because the kitchen had a 15 minute delay.. which is understandable but why wouldn t they seat us let us eat chips and salsa and have a few drinks while we wait.. when I asked to speak to the manager to ask him why they wouldn t do this he or she refused to come out..it was absolutely ridiculous and bad business..
Tres Amigos,47,Bar tender was nice and accommodating. Salsa is too hot. Chips are very average. House margaritaa  both frozen and rocks  were too limey and not that great.  Queso Especial was pretty good  Yellow but good creamy consistency. A little bland but w  salt and a touch of added salda  it was not too bad at all.
Tres Amigos,48,Horrible service horrible management    Slow service and restaurant is almost empty    I came to visit Austin and on my way out stopped in here. Will never come again   
Tres Amigos,49,Came here with some friends on a weeknight. It looks much larger from the inside. Everyone was really friendly and the service was really quick. Food was AMAZING. Definitely coming back again.    
Tres Amigos,50,I love Tres  My husband and I frequent here a lot  as it is super close to our home. Honestly we could go anywhere but really prefer to go to tres. It is never ever busy  they have the sweetest staff and seriously some of the best Tex Mex in Austin. I ve lived in Texas my whole life and they have the best tortillas I ve ever tasted. Salvador and Julio are our favorite waiters and tenders of the bar so anytime they re working you know you ll have great service and a delicious margarita. It s not a  hip  place but you ll leave fat and happy. Wear your stretchy pants.
Tres Amigos,51,The food is pretty expensive  and there s not much of it. The chimichanga was somewhat uncooked  and the quail breasts were a little overcooked  but the quail breasts were really yummy with the complimentary guacamole.  On the check they automatically added a 20  tip at the bottom of the bill and then on the paper where you sign and signature  there s another empty tip line without any indication that you already paid the tip. Even worse  at the bottom of that little paper there are suggestions for tip amounts that are percentages of the previous check with the already added 20   so if you aren t paying attention  you might tip twice and end up tipping like 42  on the food bill. Pretty annoying and incredibly dishonest. If a restaurant is going to make a tip amount that they re trying to say is mandatory  it should be the standard 15   and it should be your choice to up it the extra 5 . And along with that  they shouldn t be trying to trick people into thinking they haven t already tipped. There should be a warning of automatic tip amount too.
Tres Amigos,52,Best food I ve had since being in Austin. Great service and super accommodating. 10 10 would eat again and recommend to anyone visiting the area. Do yourself a favor and try it out 
Tres Amigos,53,Had the puffy tacos- meat was unseasoned  greasy  and tasted like it was washed through the dishwasher. Had a few bites and called it a day. Awful service  there were a few tables  but it was later after the dinner rush  and I definitely expected way better. I wish I could take this meal and experience back  so gross.
Tres Amigos,54,Tres Amigos is one of the older surviving Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin.  Stopped by here at lunch per the boss s invitation to lunch.  The service was excellent.   Our server knew the menu  was accommodating  and took great care of us.  Puffy tacos were pretty average.  Neither the best I ve had nor the worst.  If you re in the area  Tres Amigos is a perfectly acceptable option for an efficiently served lunch.  Having said that  for the price point and the lack of a lunch menu  it s somewhat uninspired Tex-Mex.
Tres Amigos,55,Pretty legit Mexican food   Stopped here for lunch and they easily accommodated our large party of 9 people. Salsa is LEGIT. Spicy  not overly-tomato-y  super addictive  I ate way too much of this stuff and they kept refilling the bowls   I ordered the chicken ranchero which was super yummy. It came in a small cauldron looking thing but it was SPICY. Seriously  I wanted to keep eating and eating because the green sauce with the onions  jalape os  and cilantro was DELICIOUS but it was so spicy that my lips were burning off. I didn t give up though  I took breaks and drank a lot of water and was able to power through and eat 90  of the bowl. So yummy with tender chicken chunks  awesome sauce  and big pieces of jalape o. I would so order this again  especially over the more Americanized options.  Overall pretty quick service  awesome authentic salsa  and yummy food  I d come back 
Tres Amigos,56,So if every employee at this restaurant were Anthony I would actually rate this place at 5 stars.  Yep.  He is that awesome.  He literally made fresh tortillas for his patrons on demand.  This guy is not just full of charisma  he is on point.  Amazing.  The food is good  delicious.  No wait.  Best kept secret 
Tres Amigos,57,Wow is all I can say  the food is the best. Always follow notes concerning diet texture and never disappoint. Great portion and taste.
Tres Amigos,58,This was my first time here  I honestly thought the food was going to be awfully poor. But come to my suprise the food was good .  Our waiter made my first experience there amazing  I sadly didnt get my waiters name. He also made sure to give us a nice visual description of the food we wanted to order. The place had a nice set-up. The music wasn t so loud  it had a extent volume. Also  the restrooms were nice and clean  no disturbing nor disgusting smell.
Tres Amigos,59,We ve passed this place hundreds of times heading home and finally stopped for dinner on a Saturday night. Food is 3 stars - but service is 5 stars. Hands down some of the best service we ve received anywhere.  There is an overall vibe of genuine  amp  wholesome niceness from the minute you walk in the door. I m not some hippie love child looking for cool auras or whatnot  but the smiles and greetings from every employee from the front entrance to the bartender were just ... well  you know how you go to a lot of the chain places and you can tell the waitstaff are just being civil so as to earn a decent tip  but you can tell by the uninterested looks on their faces they wish they could be somewhere else  and don t particularly care about your dining experience   That s NOT how it is here.  The portions are huge ... I mean  for a  12.50 dinner plate they should be. I rarely am unable to finish a meal  but had to get a to-go box for the chimichanga dinner. And the kids plates are also big enough to feed an adult. Very generous amount of food for the price you pay.
Tres Amigos,60,You should treat customers that are ordering out the same way you do with dine in. Very disappointed  Times are tough and you lost a very loyal customer 
Tres Amigos,61,We came here for lunch today and had a very good experience. The location has been here for many  many years  but it is clean and has a great atmosphere. The music and d cor immediately make you feel like you are in the right place for some good ol Mexican food. There is no pretense here  just friendly people and very good food. My wife ordered the cheese enchilada plate and thoroughly enjoyed it. The chili gravy has a really fresh flavor. I ordered the Tres Amigos plate which is served in two courses  I love it when they do that. The first plate is the puffy beef taco and guacamole. The taco was crisp and the beef was seasoned really well and had a very nice flavor. Loved it  The second plate has a beef enchilada  tamale and rice and beans. The enchilada was very good  with the same nice chile gravy as my wife s cheese enchilada. They do have several different sauces if you re feeling adventurous. The tamale was nice and thick  containing a great proportion of meat to masa. It had a very good flavor. The rice and beans were better than most  so they did their part to make this a very good lunch. Our server was an older gentleman  wish I d gotten his name  and he was fantastic. Always available if we needed something and very kind and professional.
Tres Amigos,62,Y allllllll I LOVE Tres    This is my go-to spot for frozen margs  cheesy dip  and smokey beans. Plus the staff is super attentive and the bathrooms smell so nice  I wish I had time away from pillow fluffing job to visit more often  Adios Tres 
Tres Amigos,63,My boyfriend and I have been going to the restaurant for over a year.  We love it  Theres always drink specials  the staff is very energetic  and the food always comes out great.
Tres Amigos,64,Food was good. Prices are decent. Service was great and prompt. Restaurant and bathrooms were very clean. Decor reminded me of the Panchos Mexican restaurant I went to as a kid. It was a little empty for a Saturday night. Maybe it s because of its obscure location. This place is a hidden gem  Highly recommend.
Tres Amigos,65,Tres Amigos is our main go-to place for Mexican food in the area. The food is always excellent  and the red sauce served with the tasty fresh chips has a solid spice to it. They make their own tortillas and have vegetarian options as well. An unassuming place  Tres Amigos is not your cheap dive  nor an expensive outing  but you will leave well fed and quite satisfied.   Besides a robust menu of standard and specialty items  they always have a delicious special on the board worth trying  including drinks. My favorite signature dishes are the stuffed avocado and chili relleno. They have several sauces beyond the traditional red and green to choose from on your enchiladas  my favorite is the chipotle  but wish they d add a mole . The teenage daughter loves their very tasty tortilla soup along with the queso especial. And they offer a build-your-own combination plate. Three beans to choose from  they will gladly substitute your favorite  mine being the borracho  over the black and refried .  We usually share their awesome Mexican Martini - or their grande house margarita. I can t speak to the rest of their bar  but they do have a full bar.  Our favorite server is Anthony who will take care of you whole-heartedly. Like many of the employees  he s been there quite a long time  and all take pride in their work. Worth checking out.
Tres Amigos,66,Love this place. I ve been eating here for more than 20 years  Service is great food is wonderful. Nice atmosphere with a cozy feel. Great for a casual or family meal add well as a Happy Hour with friends 
Tres Amigos,67,I ve been here several times. The food  margaritas  and service have always been great. I also love that you never have to wait for a table.    Salvador and Julio are awesome servers and they make excellent margaritas.  Manuel makes good margaritas too.
Tres Amigos,68,These 5 stars are generic. I have no complaints on the food  ppl or location. After church or after work this spot fills your tummy without emptying your wallet. Margaritas are good too.
Tres Amigos,69,Amazing food great service. queso was thick and creamy tasted great. pablano sauce was amazing on my enchiladas. hidden gem in austin tex mex scene
Tres Amigos,70,Mediocre Tex-Mex food. I ve had better food at Taco Bell.
Tres Amigos,71,Dine here 2-3 times per month. Love the hospitality- friendly staff and Ellie always makes sure food service is on point. If you are lucky- Adam is at the bar to ensure that Rita s and fajitas are on point.
Tres Amigos,72,I m very disappointed with the meal I ordered through Ubereats. My carne asada was alright but not portion correctly.  I m still hungry  The only reason I m giving Tres Amigos 3 stars is because my girlfriend was very happy with her order of chimichangas. I also got a side Caesar salad which was bigger then my entree. It was good but dry couldn t taste any dressing. The best queso in Texas is was over priced and not the best queso in Texas.
Tres Amigos,73,Service was fine. Not outstanding or anything. The prices were a little high but hot damn the food was amazing. ALL OF IT.   I had the tamales and they were the best I ve had at any restaurant. Queso was awesome. Chips and salsa awesome. The tortillas  awesome    I want some now 
Tres Amigos,74,Good food. Interesting location to try and get to. It was recommended by some friends. Queso is really good  as are the enchiladas.  Different than your typical Mexican food place in Austin. Try this place  you ll like it 
Tres Amigos,75,It was ok. The salsa was too mild. Had the enchilada dinner  came with 3  shrimp  ground beef  chicken . Chicken was the better of the 3.
Tres Amigos,76,We stopped into this place by recommendation of our daughter. She went there with one of her friends over the summer and was sooo excited to introduce it to us. Man  I was bummed for her. This place sucks...  I mean  it d be decent for half the price...but totally outrageous for the quality of food  if you want to call it that. I kid you not  taco cabana is better. We spent  65 for 3 adult meals and a kids meal. Stupid.   I m not sure if the 5 star or even 4 star reviews are freaking gringo white breads who don t understand something called  flavor   but the salsa was watery and crap  the beans sucked  portions small and queso  Come on people  really  You think this place is good  JC  Remind me not to dine out with you.   I think you feel the need to justify your enjoyment of this place because you either don t know better  or you can t tell you re getting bent over.   One guy prefers this to Arandas  Maudie s or Trudys  Really  I mean  it s price point should be about 30  less  then  I d not be so scathing.   Try Amaya s  or any of the above places and steer clear from here man...there s too many places in town to spend  65 on that can raise the bar for you.
Tres Amigos,77,Food was aight but my dude Marcus was one of the best servers I ve had. I used to be a server so I know quality service and this dude provided it.
Tres Amigos,78,Great food and a great environment  We had Adam as a server. He was very attentive  courteous and help  We love Adam 
Tres Amigos,79,My partner and I went here last night for dinner. Our server promptly came to our table and took our drink order. I noticed they had Pepsi so that was already a win for me. I looked at their menu and was able to decide what I wanted almost immediately. An avocado stuffed with chicken and bacon then breaded and fried  HELL YEAH  It was really good. It normally comes on a bed of cilantro lime rice but I opted to substitute spanish rice since cilantro tastes like soap to me.  Our server  I wish I could remember his name   was very nice and did a great job. He didn t hover too much but was right there when we needed refills. When we were done a very nice lady named Erica stopped by our table to see how our dinner was. I think she might have been the manager. Anyway  she chatted with us for a few minutes  super nice lady  and I brought up one of my favorite subjects  flan. I asked if their flan was good there and she told us about their seasonal pumpkin flan. It sounded interesting and Erica offered to send us out a complimentary pumpkin flan. It was really good and I would have gladly paid for it.  We will definitely go back and I will try their regular flan and get another one of those amazing stuffed avocados 
Tres Amigos,80,We have always had good experiences eating here. The queso especial is a favorite of ours  and all of the menu items that we have tried are really good.
Tres Amigos,81,Meh  nothing to write home about. Decent run-of-the-mill Tex-Mex. The carpeted dining room makes me feel a little dirty.
Tres Amigos,82,I ve Been coming here for over 20 years. Still the best in every way one could describe. Queso is absolutely World Famous as they say. This is Home. I ll never have a bad word about it. Well deserved.
Tres Amigos,83,In my opinion  this is the most underrated TexMex place in Austin. They claim to have the best queso in Texas and while I don t know if that is true  it is my favorite. Yes I like it better than Chuy s. The fajitas are so good I get them every time so I can t say much for the rest of the menu  though my fiance loves their Tortilla Soup. The wait staff has been genuinely friendly and helpful. This one old guy waiter seemed to love his job more than would be reasonable. I think my favorite thing though is that Tres Amigos is not crazy crowded all the time.  This is tourist free TexMex.
Tres Amigos,84,We were disappointed immediately after walking in. Looking in  you would have no idea what type of food they serve by the decor and they were playing soft elevator music that will put you to sleep. Major bummer. My friend was looking for an authentic Mexican food restaurant and this was not it. The atmosphere of this restaurant was so bland that we left before we even ordered because we were worried the food would be the same. If you want a place to eat  drink  and have a good time with friends this place will kill the mood before your night even starts.
Tres Amigos,85,We go there quite often Food is good but Adam the waiter has bad customer service towards us. He went to every table 2-3x and asked if they were doing ok or if they needed refills but yet he never came to ours  NOT EVEN ONCE. This has not been the first time him doing this. If he doesn t like his job or like Hispanic people he should go find himself another job.
Tres Amigos,86,I have passed by this place for over 10 years on my way to work and never thought much of it.  Went to a co workers retirement party tonight and was so impressed.  The appetizers laid out for the party were all delicious and the margarita on the rocks I had  okay  the two of them  had me almost seeing double.  Rare to get a decent margarita in this town that s not watered down...I felt fine paying  8 and change because they were awesome   Stinks when you pay  12 for one and then need three more to get that margarita buzz you re searching for.  The service was amazing too...might have been because it was a party and some bucks were being spent  but I m looking forward to going again on my own and seeing what it s like.
Tres Amigos,87,Terrible food. My husband s flautas were soggy  not crispy  fried . The manager offered to replace one with another and it appeared to be baked  not fried  and was awful.   My chimichanga was not crispy as it should ve been but OK. However  with the melted process cheese sauce  Velveeta Cheese Whiz  on top  it became very soggy quickly. And the bad cheese sauce was not at all good.   The margaritas were another story. My husband s was apparently good  and strong enough that he wouldn t drive   but mine had little  if any alcohol. I think it was simply lime juice and nothing more.   We live nearby and would be happy to patronize such a local business but we will NOT be back.
Tres Amigos,88,I think this place is under new ownership  must be  It was the worst  Cold food  long wait for food  no tortillas  at a Mexican restaurant right     no refills with out getting up  amp  tracking someone down. Told the management  amp  just got a shrug of shoulders  amp  shy apology. We will not be back  Oh  amp  gratuity added for table of 6 so service was extra crappy since they were getting their money no matter what 
Tres Amigos,89,The service was great. The decor was nice.  The food looked like food but tasted like nothing and salt.
Tres Amigos,90,Three friends decided to get together and create a restaurant and in that restaurant they decided to serve a dish with three tamales and those three tamales were some of the saddest tamales I have ever eaten.   Tres Amigos  you are no friends of mine.   Service  Meh. Chips and salsa  Meh. Food  Meh.   This uninspired review brought to you by an uninspired experience. Maybe the other dishes are better or maybe there is one dish that they kick ass at making  but I m not going to bother figuring it out and I suggest you just head elsewhere  too.
Tres Amigos,91,This is my first visit to Tres. I had the enchilada plate with chicken and Chipotle Chile combo. The food was very hot  fresh. The queso was of the velveeta variety  nothing to get excited about. The reasons behind my 4 star rating is 1. Our server Mark providing quick and friendly service and 2. The Tortilla machine. Never in my life have I heard tortillas scream as they re being rolled through the press. It s always a good Monday when your server commits tortilla murder in front of you ..YESSSS  D  D.
Tres Amigos,92,I took a chance on Tres Amigos for lunch Friday  since it s close to work. The staff was attentive  smiling and made us feel welcomed. We only had an hour so we didn t order any of the appetizers. My coworker really needed a margarita but advised to her that employment is a good thing.  I ordered the Durango Combo plate which consisted of chips smothered in queso  a beef enchilada with a beef chili sauce  a chalupa  rice and beans. It was really a good choice and plate of food. The chalupa was so large and smothered with lettuce and gauc that I had to use my fork to consume it. The beef enchilada could have used a little more of the beef sauce or salt as lacked a little flavor. The rice  bean and queso chips were delicious.   In all  we both enjoyed the restaurant and will return.
Tres Amigos,93,Worst service ever   Definitely not going again.The server and management absolutely horrible. Waited over an hour for our food which was not good.Part of our  party  never got served on. Do not recommend it 
Tres Amigos,94,This place was weird. Nice and seemed clean. It was moderately busy but our poor waiter could not keep up. The menu pricing was kind of weird too... 13.25 for a stuffed avocado  which was had far to much breading on it    13.25 for an appetizer quesadilla  which was fine but it was an  8 quesadilla . One in our group ordered a burrito that was flavorless. Very underwhelming lunch to say the least.
Tres Amigos,95,This is my go to place for lunch. Greta food. Good service. Definitely need to check out for happy hour drinks as well. Nice art. Reasonable prices.
Tres Amigos,96,  73  Well the wife and I have been pondering over this review since we visited..I mean we drive by this place coming down 290 maybe a couple times a week..This is our take...First  when there are no prices on the online menu  this is a sign of something    ...and that is was..Yet the place is very nice  clean and service is great..Cloth napkins  yes Im being picky  is something else the customer pays for in the long run..The food...Queso at  7  for a standard size  large  is steep  was decent...No better or worse..just  Standard ...Salsa was nothing special  and the bowl of chips was small  we went thru 3 bowls...Had to get the tortilla soup  and this flat lined for me..not much flavor  needed salt..Corn was the best part of the soup..We always start with enchiladas with a new place...Wife got the beef double rice with chipotle sauce  Myself  Chicken with the Verde sauce...Both agreed the sauces were awesome...some of the Best verde I have had...Wife was not impressed at all with the beef..They do use whole bird  and that IM a HUGE fan of  but its not mixed very well  large chucks of breast meat  that were dry..and both of our portions were small for  11 each...Charro beans were alright  have had WAY better else where...The Rice was pure MUSH...no texture at all  probably some of the worst we have had to date..Biggest killer for us is the    ...we always tip good  based on service  not the food...we did clean out plates  I mean come on..We were Hungry...But We cant go back...way to many places that are better for the price...with Los Jaliscienses up the road  we will stick with that...On to the next adventure..
Tres Amigos,97,Terrible service  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The waiter was very slow with checking on all of his smaller tables and only focused on the larger party  who came after most but were served before the other tables. When ordering the daily drink special  a small house margarita for 3.99  he did not say the modification of adding a shot of sangria would add an additional  3 to the drink  Neither the waiter or the manager cared about the poor service and when we asked what they could do  they said they would not comp any of the drinks or food. Slow service  and a manager with a poor attitude. I won t be surprised or upset if this business is sold like the other Tres Amigos were.
Tres Amigos,98,Was in the mood for Mexican food and decided to come here since it was close by and I hadn t been in over 10 years. I ordered the lunch special  shredded chicken enchiladas covered in avocado sauce served with rice and refried beans as well as a small serving of chili con queso. I thought everything was ok  not spectacular mind you. The only real complaint I had was the serving of queso. It was as runny as water. The service was good except they never refilled my water now that I think about it  I drank all of mine. The price was  10.50. All in all a very middle of the road establishment. With all the other Mexican food places nearby I won t be returning.
Tres Amigos,99,We drive from Round Rock to come here. I brought another couple with us. This place is usually really good. Last night we decided to come on a Saturday night bragging to our friends how good this place is  food wise.  Wow we were surprised how boring it was in there for a Saturday night in the bar area. The music was very low and it was outdated music. It totally did not go with the Mexican restaurant. I usually ask them to change it to Spanish and they do it right away. It s usually not the best Spanish music but it helps feeling like you are in a Mexican resturant and not in a Lubys restaurant. Crazy thing is I asked the 4 different employees if they could change it and they all said they would check on that and never came back with a yes or no. So the same boring low music played. Before we left I asked why they never changed it and one person said we have to have a code and our general manager who was here today doesn t like Spanish music. Wth    And to top it all off we ordered 3 Mexican Martinis which SUCKED... They were watery and tasted like they didn t have a drop of alcohol.  A huge disappointment since we were told by our waiter the Martinis we re better than there margaritas. Since they were so weak and watery we told our waiter and the bartender my husband also said his margarita was not as strong as usual the bartender just said  well I make them the same every day   and of course like the music they didn t care .Since we had already ordered our food and the Mexican Martinis SUCKED  2 of us ordered large margaritas they were also weak and not as good as usual. One of us ordered a beer because he figured they can t mess up on that. And my other friend just refused to pay for another crappy drink.  The salsa was good the chips were stale. The appetizer was blah. My husband ordered his usual carne guisada plate with lime rice and it was very good. I ordered the fish taco plate and my tacos were skimpy. My friend order the special and he said it was smaller than most places but it was good and my other friend ordered tortilla soup she said it was good as well but temp wise was not hot. We all agree the tortillas are perfect.   Well after our horrible experience with the music  boring atmosphere and weak martinis maybe because martins were on special  8.95   weak margaritas which are normally good. Example  My husband usually orders 2 small margaritas. Last night he had to order 2 large to feel the same effect. So it cost us extra money and cost us extra calories. Due to this very unpleasant night and  112.00 later we will NEVER come here again.  This place could use new management. They never make us feel welcomed never once have stopped us to ask how everything is out of the 5x we have gave them business. To me the managment has no desire passion or personality to run Tres Amigos. Its called Tres Amigos which means 3 friends.The managment and some of the staff like the host are not friendly. Not once did the manager stop to address any of these issues. She just kept walking past us with her nose in the air.
Tres Amigos,100,Ben is the best bartender    And the Mexican martinis are delicious    And heavy hands all around    
Tres Amigos,101,Never coming back   service under par   ate my fajitas with no tortillas  cold beans and rice    a party of 18 only one person to sever us . Missing food   was told straws are by the self service counter . Never again sorry
Tres Amigos,102,Strong margaritas and above average tex-mex  For awhile  my family and I were used to visiting La Palapa down the street before catching Friday night football at Nelson field. I must say  Tres Amigos has them beat by miles  and I m happy to have another pre-game option.   Service was pretty much a disaster  but it was our server s first week and we were a big group  so I don t want to give her too much grief. The entire experience would ve been much more pleasant had we not missed the first quarter of the game due to check discrepancies and forgotten orders.   In terms of food  the fresh salsa was a stand out. My fajitas  while flavorful  were pretty measly slithers of meet and the tortillas never came. Of course  I could ve reminded her  but by then I had already put in about three reminders for other things  I was tired of reminding.
Tres Amigos,103,We went there tonight and our visit was pretty terrible. The manager is a joke and completely rude. The server we had was nice but we still had issues with our order. Overall the experience was very disappointing. Save your money and go somewhere else. There are many more options out there.
Tres Amigos,104,This was a HORRIBLE experience    Food was cold- queso was cold. Got fajitas for 2 - didnt get tortillas till 30min after we got our food. We all ate and our family NEVER received their food   
Tres Amigos,105,So this is the closest Mexican place to me. In past few months I have been here several times a month. THEY ARE NEVER BUSY. seriously  Friday night  Friday lunch  Saturday night. just never busy - good if you want to walk in but where is the customers  will they be closing soon      My husband LOVES the chips and salsa.  hes picky - so its great he loves their chips and salsa     Food is good as well.  But the service - I havent had ANYONE that I actually liked  meaning one lady took our drink order and  forgot  next thing were getting food  and we ask for drinks     Couple days ago server brings drinks and queso  walks away  were searching for ANYONE to say   hey what do we eat queso with  - we had to ask for chips.    For it to be so SLOW I expect better service. Yes I always tip - just aggravating when my tea glass is empty for the larger portion of the meal  and yes we got there Wednesday night at 8pm - they close at 10pm   i used to be a server too and i hated having people come in at closing  
Tres Amigos,106,Edit  This has gotten better. The service is much faster and friendlier these days. Unfortunately  I have stopped drinking and I miss those margaritas  Food was better when I was drinking but  I m still a fan of certain dishes like the fajitas or Chicken Cesar Michoacan.   I can walk to Tres Amigos and so they get one star and LOTS of my business for that.  I go a lot  that has been the case for a few months now.  No one knows me even though they have each served me at least three times. That is ok  I m not too memorable. However  the service in general is distracted and slow. I can t blame this on the servers because they are all great folks...when everyone is slow it is clearly a management issue.  That said  bad service is a small price to pay for strong margaritas and decent food in walking distance. I always have a good time  that is why I keep going back.
Tres Amigos,107,Random mex place close to my house  defn more  mex  than  tex    Strong margaritas and a variety of entree s its hard to make a choice.  The queso  amp  guac are good  and they are not shy with the heat in the salsa.  Also  you can choose your protein and from about six different enchilda sauces  which never hurts anything.  Have been here half a dozen times  and a great place to bring people visiting from out of town.
Tres Amigos,108,Service was great. Friendly staff always with a smile. Very clean place. However the food was not good. The steak tacos did not taste like steak tacos and it had more green peppers than anything else. Steak lacked seasoning and the texture was not ideal. Presentation of food was also not great.
Tres Amigos,109,I ve lived down the street from this restaurant for over 30 years have recently moved out of the neighborhood pay a visit for takeout  the manager actually took my order told her what I wanted  she looked it over said everything was in there I took her word for it get all the way back to Pflugerville and they don t have none of my sauces for my main entree. Call the restaurant back ask them what they were they going to do about my order. She told me nothing that I actually needed to bring my credit card back in order for them to credit my meal back to my card I told her she needed to send me a gift card or something and if I m ever in the area in the near future I ll use it then but she wasn t going to do that either. Rude customer service. Even the gentleman that answered the phone was rude telling me he wasn t going to comp my order just for some sauce. I m not eating no damn dry burrito. Trust me I will not be going back to this location with this management that s new over there. They can send me the gift card and I ll take my business to another restaurant if there s any still open. Manager tells me customer s always right no customers are not always right but you re going to tell me you re not going to do anything. That I need to bring my card in in order to get it comped no I do not. They lost lobg time loyal customer  thats for sure 
Tres Amigos,110,I just had the most bizarre experience here.  I ordered chicken flautas and one had no chicken in it.  I spoke with the manager and she took my plate to show the kitchen.  She asked me what it was and had a new one made.  When she brought it out it also had very little chicken  maybe 1 tablespoon  on one end.  I ve been to this location 30  times and have ordered this often.  This is not normal.  I asked her to come back over so I could show her.  She proceeded to tell me that there was chicken in it before they fried it so she didn t know what happened to it.  She then brought out from the kitchen the ENTIRE PAN full of un-fried flautas to show me.  Not only was this unnecessary but it was also unsanitary and very unprofessional.  She told me...I can make you 100 more but they will all be the same.  I was highly disappointed in her lack of tact and professionalism.   There was no apology  no attempt to make it better  no offer of something different  and nothing comped...not even my drink  I work near by and have frequented this location but this was my last time.
Tres Amigos,111,First  the numerous good aspects... The food is consistently tasty  and it s always more than I can eat in one sitting.  The chips and salsa are free and among the tastiest I ve found in Austin.  The delicious tortillas are made fresh on site.  The wait staff is always friendly.  The the not quite so good...  Their prices have been creeping up lately  they re still fairly reasonable  but I hope the trend doesn t continue.  The management is not always very agreeable  for instance  a complaint about the woman s handicap-access restroom stall handle and latch has gone unrectified for at least six months now.  It s a minor annoyance  but why blow off something so easy to fix 
Tres Amigos,112,Decided to go after work today and it was a nice Mexican restaurant with the best queso I ve had. Gotta give it up to the waiter we had  he was super friendly and was always checking up on us   
Tres Amigos,113,After a particularly stressful day at work  I was in SERIOUS need of a drink.  My friend mentioned that her friend wanted to come here  so I tagged along.  The restaurant was really dead  there were two tables other than ours.  By the time we finished up  we were the only people there.  I had seen a couple people come in  but don t know where they disappeared to.  Tres Amigos has the typical taqueria feel  nothing really out of the ordinary here.  I ordered a Mexican Martini to start off the evening...it was quite tasty  but a touch sweeter than I prefer.  My dining companions had house margaritas...in HUGE glasses.  They were pretty tasty as well  I ordered one as my second beverage.  I must say that the drinks were made INCREDIBLY strong...hence the slight priciness.    I opted not to eat  which led to my ultimate downfall   but the menu contained pretty standard Tex Mex fare...as I said  nothing really out of the ordinary.  My vegetarian friend was pleased with her choice of a combo plate of sorts.  For around  7  you get one entree with a choice of 3 sides...a really good deal  I believe.  The others ordered the same  with different combinations.  Just before 9pm  our waitron approached our table to ask if we needed anything else because the bar was closing for a c repair.  I m not sure if this was an excuse to get us out  but the posted hours are at least an hour longer than that...I don t know what the deal was.  I ll be coming back  mostly because it s close to my house 
Tres Amigos,114,I received a coupon in the mail for  12 off  which is a great deal  so we decided to go eat there for dinner.  We were seated promptly  but were not greeted by our waiter for at least 10 minutes. When the waiter finally showed up  it was to inform us that he was switching with another waiter. No one offered to refill our drinks until the meal had arrived  which is pretty annoying considering you re eating chips and salsa.   I went out on a limb and ordered Pescado Veracruz   15.00   and my wife had a combo plate   8.00 . The fish tasted like mud  my corn tortillas tasted like old shoes and had a slightly fuzzy texture  and I ve never been somewhere that was as skimpy as they were with refried beans. My wife s food in general was decent  but the black beans were awfully seasoned. The portions for both were meager  especially for the price. I ve never been to a skimpy tex-mex restaurant until now. The only thing I actually enjoyed was the cilantro-lime rice my wife ordered.  Overall  service sucked  price sucked  atmosphere was ok  and the food was terrible. Will definitely not eat there again.
Tres Amigos,115,We were in town for a night. Awesome Mexican food   Everything was soo good  They were able to accommodate my gluten allergy too. Great service  We ll return when we re back in ATX.
Tres Amigos,116,As anyone who reads my reviews has probably gathered  I m not much of a Tex Mex fan.  But as Tex Mex goes  I like Tres Amigos more than most.  My recent lunch here started with the standard basket of chips with salsa.  I didn t like the chips much  they were too heavy and not salty enough.  The salsa  though it seemed homemade  didn t excite me  either  it was very runny and not flavorful enough to stand up to the overly-flavorful chips.  I think the chips would have worked pretty well with queso  but they weren t working for me with the salsa.  As much as I like having something to nibble on before my meal  I have a tendency to stuff myself on chips and salsa and regret it later  so I was actually glad that there wasn t much of a temptation to do so here.  I ordered the taco plate   8.75   which came with three tacos  beef or chicken  your choice of crispy or soft shells   choice of beans  black  refried  or charro   rice  and a little scoop of guac.  I liked the tacos pretty well  especially after covering them in guacamole.  The meat was flavorful but not too greasy.  The rice was pretty standard Spanish rice - nothing too exciting.  I was really full after eating the tacos  so I didn t even try the beans.  I also tried my friend s carne guisada  which was very good - tender and with just the right amount of kick.  I ll definitely put that on my list to order another time.  Service was very attentive and just friendly enough - engaging when appropriate  yet unobtrusive when appropriate  too.    In short  not bad at all...for Tex Mex.
Tres Amigos,117,This is some of the best Tex-Mex I ve had in Austin.  The tortillas were hot and fresh and reminded me of my grandmother s.  So good   Margaritas were good and strong.  Chicken fajitas were full of flavor.  I m a fan 
Tres Amigos,118,This is one of the few actual restaurants in the immediate neighborhood where we can actually sit down and have a drink   With that said  the standard house margaritas are consistently strong and quite good.  The Mexican Martini is even better   The food can be hit or miss at times  but I ve learned to stick with the following   puffy tacos  enchiladas  queso  quail poppers and the fajitas.  The salsa can be excellent some days and a big OK on others.  But since I prefer it on the hot and spicy side  I am happy when they oblige.  The do have a good happy hour even on Saturday and Sunday.  It also seems like they are really trying to improve their marketing in the 78723  hood.  The service is always friendly as well.  Overall  this is a solid place to go when we don t want to venture outside of the neighborhood.  And with the stiff margaritas  it s nice to be able to walk home.
Tres Amigos,119,I love this place but hate it too. They have the best Flan in Austin. And if you get a waiter who makes strong drinks  then you can get drunk after 1 drink. Unfortunately  since waiters are also bar tenders  their service can be quite slow.  But between the flan  the strong drinks  if you are lucky with the waiters  and the cilantro and lime rice. I keep going back.
Tres Amigos,120,The food was ok. Not that great. I was told to come here to try out their drinks but for the price  I may as well go to Trudy s to enjoy better chips and salsa  drinks and food.  The chip was pretty stale and salsa had a weird taste to it. Soup was extremely watery and not chunky or flavorful.  Will not be coming again.
Tres Amigos,121,The only thing better than Tres Amigos food tonight was there service   They were busy   but made us feel like we were their only customers   Cant thank them enough for everything 
Tres Amigos,122,I ve always had good service and good food.  I will come back.....and the house Rita s are great 
Tres Amigos,123,This place is between my job  amp  home   amp  I go here to pick up lunch quite a bit. I absolutely LOVE their chicky tort soup  right up there with Baby A s to me. LOL I ve had other soups that were REALLY GOOD too  will review them later. I also like their crispy beef tacos  when the soup is not enough. LOL The chips salsa are really good  I eat those UP  The staff pretty much knows my face AND what I want as soon as I walk in  always so friendly. I go a few times a month  been here for dinner a couple of times  and Happy Hour. A good place to eat....
Tres Amigos,124,Like Revlynn and Quani mentioned  this place is great... for not having to go far.  I live really nearby too  so it s nice to be able to get to some decent food in a three minute round trip.    They have yummy drink specials daily  like midori pina coladas and mango daiquiris made with malibu mango for  5.75.  Queso is supposed to cost  4.75  but our waiter  forgets  it to put it on our tab.  A few vegetarian options  I settled on quesadillas  sweeten the deal  and my husband adores the tortilla soup.  I wouldn t cross town to get here  but we don t  so it works for us.
Tres Amigos,125,THIS is my neighborhood restaurant. I just hop in the car or even walk  I love going here when I don t feel like cooking dinner  or I want a tasty Mexican Martini  they re quite good here    or I m craving some of their house-made flour tortillas.  Oh god  those tortillas....I just drooled a little...  The service here is fantastic -- everyone smiles at you  your server is friendly and attentive  but not too attentive   and the food is homey and filling. I always have to get a to-go box here  the servings are so huge  There s a ton of parking and it s easy-on-off Hwy 290 E or 183 to get there.   The Thursday night drink special is my favorite  the Mexican Martini. Now  we all know Trudy s has the best in town  but Tres Amigos makes a mean 2nd place. All the flavors are there  and they ll give you plenty of extra olives if you ask.  And I do    So yeah  I dig this place. It s casual  filling  friendly  and affordable. What s not to love 
Tres Amigos,126,YUCK  no flavor and piss warm food. Don t know what the folks who leave four and five stars are used to  but this is bad chow. On the other hand strong ritas and good bartender. My dad is a retired executive chef he says the original owner s probably are up in age now and had to sell. So sad being a long time resident of the 2-3 we used to come here a lot  especially for the puffy tacos. I see this place has changed a lot just like everything else in 2-3
Tres Amigos,127,We got some awesome coupons in the mail from Tres Amigos.  So  our decision about where to eat last night was pretty easy.    But  my stomach hurts today.  Nuff said.  Seriously though  the service was good  the margaritas were really good.  The food was average  average tex-mex in Austin is not good enough  but stay away from the enchiladas.  I shudder to think of them.
Tres Amigos,128,Some of the best Mexican food around town. It s been around for a long time for a reason- the food is just that good. It may not be for everyone s taste  but I ve never had anything bad there. I used to go there for dinner while I was working evenings and it was never a problem to be in and out and back at work within an hour- how s that for fast service 
Tres Amigos,129,I think it s great they offer employment opportunities to the mental handicapped. Seriously  If I have to remind the waiter multiple time for silverware and what food I ordered  there is a problem. The manager seems to have better things to do then watch the restaurant. Even thought she gently reminded our waiter basics  such as refill drinks at a table  the waiter managed to forget after picking up the glass. The food does not seem to be consistent every visit.   I will say if you go  get the waiter Anthony. He is the saving grace of the restaurant. Why he is not teaching the other waiters is beyond me. He definitely is the only five star of this place.
Tres Amigos,130,A solid Mexican Food Restaurant.  You won t regret going there.  They feature several different sauces for topping your entree which  is a big departure from many Tex-Mex places that slather crappy chili sauce on top of everything.  That leads me to my next observation.  This is head and shoulders above most Tex-Mex places to the extent that it is more Sonoran or California style.  Delicious food and the margaritas are made with fresh lime juice.  Don t bother ordering the 15 fish    Plenty of off street parking.
Tres Amigos,131,Generous portions  great service and wonderful food await you at Tres Amigos.   Though I  personally  haven t visited their other locations  the Northeast restaurant is great  We live blocks away  so pick-up works well for us. You might prefer a seat at the full bar or one in their warm and welcoming dining room. Either way  you re in for a treat. The staff is always cheerful and so are the diners. Why not  After an Enchilada Dinner you ll be smiling  too. Three big enchiladas with your choice of seven sauces. I like lots of fat  firm shrimp wrapped in a fresh flour tortilla  then bathed in Ranchero sauce. You ll want to  design your own  as the menu advises  just don t forget the rice and beans  Finish with flan  Mexican Spice Cake or just shout  uncle   and leave dessert for the kids. You are ready for a night on Sixth Street or the House Wives of Whatever.  At Tres Amigos everyone leaves happy.
Tres Amigos,132,Queso was melted velveeta. The stuffed avocado was amazing. Margs were awesome and happy hour in Sunday s.
Tres Amigos,133,One star for Monday  3 Margarita night. Second star for their delicious  and unlimited  chips and salsa. Third star for the attentive service and smiling waitstaff.  This place is one of the only restaurants in our neighborhood so we re here quite often. It probably takes us 30 seconds to drive here from our house  which is wonderful.  My husband and I have only tried a handful of things on their menu because we have the habit of ordering the same thing over and over again  a.k.a. the fail-safe choice. Not once have we been disappointed with the food here.   What I love most about Tres Amigos are their chips and salsa. Their chips are thin and crispy  like chips should be  and their salsa has just the right amount of kick to it and isn t chunky like most salsas can be. I can  and usually do  eat a couple of baskets of chips before our food even comes out.  Overall  it s not the hands down best but it s very well worth that 30 second trip every now and then.
Tres Amigos,134,My mom and I came here because the atmosphere outside looked  authentic .  It was authentic for sure but the food was nothing outstanding.   The staff was very kind and the service was great. The ambiance was fun and I really enjoyed that part of it. There were several Christmas parties going on so it was very festive.   If the food hadn t been so average  I would give this a higher post but I always judge a Mexican restaurant on its queso. If the queso is no bueno  the food that follows is usually the same.   Other than that... keep your front of house staff and maybe think about a back of the house change   
Tres Amigos,135,Mid-day on Thursday I received an email invitation from a friend and neighbor  ahem Emily Z.  that explained all of the reasons I should go to Tres Amigos.  It read as follows    1. Tres Amigos is delicious 2. Tres Amigos is well priced 3. Tres Amigos has strong drinks 4. Tres Amigos is never crowded 5. Tres Amigos was featured in several episodes of  Friday Night Lights  6. We will get to hang out like old times   Although I ve lived within a few miles of this place for a number of years  I had never noticed it and if I had  would have been deterred by the fact that it is next door to a pawn shop ... because pawn shops always make me feel a little sad.  Long story short  I decided to give it a try.   There were 7 of us and we arrived in waves rather than all at once.  The wait staff was completely accommodating and unaffected by the intermittent addition of new people at the table.  They just kept the chairs and the margaritas coming.  It s a large restaurant and there were lots of big tables with large groups.    We had two baskets of chips and I appreciated the fact that they did  not  refill them again before our order arrived because it actually left room for food.  Instead  we took advantage of the selection of strong margaritas that even came in unheard of flavors like black raspberry.  Dinner took a while to arrive  but it left lots of time for talking and catching up.  Since I had never eaten there before  I started out with my standard firs-time order that lets me get a sense of the food at a mexican or tex-mex restaurant  chicken enchiladas verdes.  I was pleasantly surprised - the chicken was moist and the sauce was quite spicy compared to most that I have encountered.    Meanwhile  I marveled at the combo plates that everyone else created - crispy tacos that covered an entire plate  a guacamole  cup   charro beans  and the crown jewel of most plates  a majestic puffy cheese-covered taco that showcases queso and commands attention by taking up about one third of the plate.  Is it good   I dunno  but everyone was excited and they disappeared quickly.  According to everyone s descriptions  I gather that it is like eating a savory sopapilla.    I think my favorite thing about this restaurant is that we took waaaay more than tres amigos to dinner and we got friendly  laid-back service and reliably tasty food.  If you are looking for fine dining then a tex-mex restaurant on the side of highway 290 is not for you.  If you want some beef  chicken  and cheese served alongside platters of rice and beans  along with strong margaritas  then this is your place.
Tres Amigos,136,Let me preface this review by saying that I REALLY wanted to like Tres Amigos. I mean  they filmed scenes from Friday Night Lights here  It s an Austin original  But sadly  I was extremely underwhelmed.   Food  Their chips are sourced from only the freshest bags and nothing but premium canned salsa makes the cut  Very little metallic taste  Not to mention that their beans and rice were probably only microwaved once or twice. Woo Hoo   Service   Y all want something to drink    No  we ve been sitting at the bar for the past 5 minutes desperately yearning for the pleasure of your company but NOW that you ve mentioned it...    Drinks  This was their one redeeming virtue  as the margaritas are actually pretty decent and they certainly don t skimp on the tequila. Also  the glasses they serve them in are recycled bottom halves of wine bottles. Definitely thought that was a neat touch.   All in all  this place falls into the  middle of the road  tier of the Austin Tex-Mex scene. If a yawn and a tortilla had a baby  it would be named Tres Amigos.
Tres Amigos,137,The chimichanga was pretty good  with it s processed white flour tortilla fried and covered with velveeta-style  queso  and stuffed with bland-ish ground beef. Nice.  The Puffy Tacos were not as great  although not bad. They were like mini taco salads. Again  the ground beef was less flavorful than Taco Cabana. Good amount of lettuce and tomato. The shells themselves were unique - light and airy.   Very attentive service.  Not worth a special mention  overall.
Tres Amigos,138,Just another average Tex Mex restaurant. Food is good  as was the staff. I will be back. No complaints  we had a nice time. A little cold inside  but that might just be me. My boyfriend wasn t cold.
Tres Amigos,139,The food is not great. Chicken is dry  sour cream sauce is liquidy and bland  refried beans are too lardy. The only thing I ve ever ordered here and really liked is the queso. Can t say anything bad about that. The service is usually very slow and the food is overpriced for the quality. I wouldn t recommend this place unless you just want queso and maybe some drinks.
Tres Amigos,140,Unlike most yelp-ers  I enjoyed Tres Amigos. For no frills Tex-Mex it is a reliable place. The roasted chicken is moist and the flour tortillas were freshly prepared. The black beans were a solid C  but nothing to go back for. I liked the salsa  The prices were reasonable and on this particular Tuesday night  we nearly had the dining room to ourselves.   The location is weird and a little hard to get to. The only other negative in my opinion is the size of their water glasses. I needed 4 refills during our meal    Other than that  they claim to have the best Queso in Texas... I can t comment on that but I can say the food is edible and the service was great. Thanks TA 
Tres Amigos,141,They get 5 stars for amazing margs and really great queso.  The atmosphere could use a boost.  When it is quiet in there  I mean really quiet...like no music it is kinda creepy to be honest.  I was taken there about a year ago for my birthday  and have gone back at least once a month since.  It is in a very convenient location to my work 
Tres Amigos,142,I go to this location fairly often. The service leaves something to be desired  but the food itself is quite authentic and good. Last time I was there  we found part of a dish scrubber in the enchiladas. I m willing to write it off as a fluke and give them a second chance just because I love the food most of the time.
Tres Amigos,143,So I stoped in for Lunch B C I had a Meetin up tha Street....ugh will never make this mistake ever again I am A mexcian food Lover and this was just a plain disapointment...sad to Say.. the Rice was over cooked as well as the Prices. ... wasted time n Money n coulda went further dwn the street for better food less     Sorry Tres Amigos ur Lacking more than  Amigos here.....     ps gave it 1star b c couldn t go lower.booooo
Tres Amigos,144,Had a great meal. It always looks empty  but after driving in there was a good amount of cars n people inside. Anthony our waiter was very fast  but he slid drinks and plates across our table. Not something we appreciated. We also had to ask another waiter for a chip refill because he hadn t returned to check on us. Overall a great dinner with my husband and 2 year old   
Tres Amigos,145,I have been patronizing Tres Amigos since 1978 but usually ate at the Loop 360 location which recently closed. I tell everyone that they serve the best TexMex in town. Since the 290 location is close to work I took my technicians there to eat. They ordered the fajitas for 2 at  32. They were the worst fajitas they had ever hsd and definitely were NOT a full pound as stated. Had to get home so called the next day to complain. Told the manager how long I had been a loyal customer. Since I didn t complain that night   I wanted to see what my guys thought of them when I saw them the next morning  they would only give me a measly  20 gift certificate.  I WILL NEVER EAT AT TRES AMIGOS AGAIN. My cousin actually came up with the poblano cream sauce recipe. We had all family occasion dinners there. And you insult me by not even covering the cost of what I was complaining about 
Tres Amigos,146,Pretty good Mexican food. Loved the salsa. But the staff was just so incredibly nice that I loved this place. They seemed so happy we were there  amp  just had the friendliest attitudes.
Tres Amigos,147,If you re looking for a good Mexican food restaurant  go check out Tres Amigos.  It s a little challenging to get to...but worth the u-turn on the feeder road.    Always check out the specials...they sometimes have really good seafood items 
Tres Amigos,148,Always awesome. Ask for Salvador. He will give you superior service. He makes you feel like family. Have yet to eat anything that was not great.
Tres Amigos,149,One star for serving rotten shrimp far too hot  for mixing up both our orders  for failing to ask if there were any problems  and for ignoring my comments.
Tres Amigos,150,I absolutely love this place  It s my favorite mexican restaurant for two reasons.  1  they have some of the best salsa in town. I ve been to a lot mexican places in Austin and this is hands down my favorite salsa. Better than Chuy s  Maudies  and El Arroyo.  2 They also have some kick ass queso. These are the standards by which all mexican restaurants should be rated. They are staples and should be on point. The service is also very good. The servers are nice and helpful and they have great dring specials every day of the week 
Tres Amigos,151,Tres Amigos is THE authentic Tex-Mex experience in Austin. It s not all fancy-shmancy like Maudie s on 360 or Z Tejas  and it s not all touristy like Chuy s or Trudy s  and it s not a dump like  well  some other places I won t enumerate. It s just the platonic ideal of  local Tex-Mex joint.   The staff is excellent. They are always very friendly and accommodating  and we have a toddler  so we are often a challenge to staff . They are casual and talk to you like one person to another  but they also know how to fill an order promptly and correctly. It is some of the best service I ve ever received in Austin.  Tres Amigos loses a star because the food is only just OK. It s far from bad and is occasionally great but for the most part is unexceptional. But  if you are looking for the baseline Tex-Mex against which all others compare  this is it. On the other hand  the drinks are fantastic. They are nice and strong   If you are looking for a place with great atmosphere  FANTASTIC service  and archetypal Tex-Mex food  you won t do better than Tres Amigos.
Tres Amigos,152,About 10 of us went here to celebrate a coworker s birthday during lunch. It was close to work and most mexican food or Tex-Mex is a sure thing.  Little did I know that I was about to enter the chambers of these people who desparately want to destroy anything that should be tasty.  The chips and queso lacked any flavor besides the occasional chip which tasted like sawdust. I ordered the Stuffed Avocado.  Avocados are usually great all by themselves  and anything fried is always awesome.  Somehow Tres Amigos found a way to dial down the flavor.  This is what I imagine they eat at Guantanamo Bay.  Just blend some wet cardboard in with something else that may resemble an avocado and there ya go.  It was served on a bed of white rice which looked like it was taken out of a 5-minute steam bag.  Most Mexican restaurants have  mexican style rice  but maybe they were trying some kind of Asian fusion and didn t let their customers know.  I would tell anybody that I cared about not to go to Tres Amigos.  If you were hosting a group of Europeans and they wanted to eat some good Mexican food  I would be embarrassed to take them here.  We live in a place that has some of the best mexican food in the world and somehow this place has managed to have not 1  but 5  locations in Austin.  It s embarrassing.  Have some respect for yourself and those you care about and go to Trudys.
Tres Amigos,153,Came in during a slow period. So service was fast and our table was well taken care of. Staff made sure to keep our drinks full and made sure we had everything we needed. Enchilada plates and tortilla soup were very tasty. Also had great salsa and chips. Only reason I could not give 5 stars is because prices per plate are somewhat higher than similar restaurants in the area.
Tres Amigos,154,We had a great experience when we went to dinner here on 12 15 12.  We were greeted as soon as we came in the door and were seated in the main dining room- it s large and comfortable  the tables aren t crammed together.  Our server- I believe his name was Salvador  was friendly and attentive- we never had to look for him.  They had a special- enchiladas with avocado cream sauce. DIVINE   The plate came with 2 enchiladas  crispy taco  queso cup  rice and beans.  I found out that I can ask for the avocado sauce when it s not the special- THANK YOU THANK YOU    My partner had the stuffed avocado- I was able to get a bite of it before she threatened to stab me with her fork.  It was delicious- hence her wanting to keep me from getting another bite.      The manager  Erica  was very nice and made us feel very welcome there.  We will definitely be back 
Tres Amigos,155,This place is your run of the mill Tex Mex restaurant.  The food is fine.  The drinks are fine.  Everything is just fine.  I ll keep going because it s close to work and they have happy hour until 6 00 PM.
Tres Amigos,156,I love Tres Amigos   They have the BEST made in house fresh flour tortillas   They can easily accommodate Vegetarians and Vegan if you say no cheese and it has never been a problem.  They have some great servers  3 of the guys have been there as long as I have been a customer  about 5 years  and they know me by name and even know my voice when I call in a to-go order.  The new servers can be iffy but they are new so I always give them a break.  Their red salsa and chips which are complimentary are great   The red salsa is little spicy for my taste but I have had many people say its the best salsa they have ever had   I will ask for a side of salsa Verde to accommodate the fact that I can t handle super spicy foods and they always oblige with no complaints.  I think the prices are very reasonable so no complaints from me there.  I don t drink but my friends that do have ordered a small margarita and that is all it takes for them to feel the buzz of the tequila   The servers act as their own bartender and they are generous with their pours     I had a super bad server once  but it was kind of not his fault  he was heading out to smoke  gross in my humble opinion  as we were walking in and the hostess sat us in his section maybe not knowing he had just stepped outside.  They were super busy that day and no one was able to get to us to step in and help as they often will so we had to wait for that guy to get done his cig and come back in.  He was apologetic but it was with tobacco breath with was kind of nasty.  His service was decent but I have never seen him there again so I can only assume they parted ways with him.  One time I called in a to-go order  picked it up  got to my destination 5 minutes down the road and realized I was missing something I had ordered.  I called to check and they had forgotten to put it in the bag  they offered to deliver it to me which was super generous but I didn t mind driving back to pick it up so I did and they were super apologetic about the mistake.  Overall this place is fantastic  I really have enjoyed being their customer for the last 5  years and am always recommending this place to others   It is my go-to place when people come in town because I know the food is going to be consistently good  the regular servers are just awesome and its always just a good experience when I dine in or out   Tres Amigos gets 5 stars in my book 
Tres Amigos,157,Good food  little inconsistent with the margarita size and strength. I love the vegetable enchiladas.
Tres Amigos,158,Great place  Best tortillas ever   They make them fresh   Happy hour prices are fantastic.  Pitcher of Dos Equis for  8.30   Yes please   Their Sangria is a must try   Order the liter.  Trust me  half liter is not enough   I ve had their shrimp enchiladas  chicken ranchero  carne guisada...all delicious   Full of flavor.  Not one of those places that make everything bland.  Yuck   Service is awesome.  Probably because we always get Gonzalo.  He s the best   Food deserves 4 stars but Gonzalo alone gets 5 stars so Tres Amigos gets cinco estrellas from me   Wish they were closer because this would be my default happy hour location 
Tres Amigos,159,This place just doesn t compare to the other Mexican and Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin.  There s absolutely nothing special about it.  I hate to give it such a low rating considering their food was alright as well as the service  but I cannot honestly recommend going here over  let s say  Taquerias Arandas on South 1st.  On a more positive note  they don t seem to get very busy during lunch so it s a perfect place for a quiet meal.
Tres Amigos,160,Good but not great food.  It s your standard TexMex restaurant with decent food at good prices.  They are pretty accommodating when it comes to requests and wait staff is always friendly.  We have always been seated quickly with very little if any wait time.
Tres Amigos,161,Good food  great service  way cute Joshua W    and tasty margaritas 
Tres Amigos,162,My group had been going to Tres Amigos for around 6 months and last night was the very last night we will ever step foot in there again. I arrived at 7pm on 10 9 14 found 3 of my group already seated and with drinks. I sat down and started enjoying the company. The waiter showed up and I ordered a house margarita on the rocks with salt. Our last companion arrived shortly there after and we proceeded to have our normal conversations. Our food arrived in a normal amount of time  but the server who took the order couldn t even remember who ordered what so he had to call out the dishes. While eating I had to flag our server down to get a glass of iced tea  but he didn t even bother to even attempt to refill any of the other glasses. Time goes by and again we have to flag him down to get our checks which he didn t even split correctly. Then come to see that he put gratuity on them for our party. We knew we would be charged gratuity if we had 6 people  but to put it on there for a party of 5 and not serve them well is unthinkable. I then walked up to the manager who was at the cash register and asked him why. The managers explanation was that the server put in 6 people so it automatically put gratuity on the checks. I asked him to take it off because we were not a party of 6 and we shouldn t have to tip for the little service we had. He then told me he could refund my  but would not refund the rest of the party. I told him we had been coming here for over 6 months and that the places service was spotty at best and that if he didn t try to fix it we would not come back. He just shrugged and walked away.  I was not looking for him to refund the meal just the tip because the service was horrible. He didn t care enough to even try to fix the problem.   Spotty service  bad management  good  but not spectacular food....my group won t be going back ever.
Tres Amigos,163,I love their puffy tacos  So delicious and cute 
Tres Amigos,164,I will make this pretty simple. If you like taco bell or taco cabana  please eat here. Unfortunately  most of my experience eating at  tex mex  places in Austin has been beyond disappointing. Everyone dumps cheese on their bland  pale pinto beans and the rice is stale  orange and flavorless. I think people just get side tracked and figure they are just side items that people don t even bother with so why put in the effort    I ve been to this estasblishment twice and each time I was very disappointed. Each time we ordered the queso which tasted just like canned nacho cheese with added peppers. Tacos  enchiladas were covered in cheese  which of course someone is trying to compensate for the meat being beyond bland.  Ok. Enough. Service was good  food was bland and disappointing. Avoid like the plague.
Tres Amigos,165,Me and my roommate wanted to try this place every for a while now so we decided to do the drive from hutto this location and first i have to say the staff i really rude the waitress never checked on us or offered a refill on my roommates drink the food was good the beer a rita i order need some work you could barely taste the alcohol in it but with the rudeness of the waitress well will not be going back to this location again
Tres Amigos,166,I love Tres Amigos.  Never have to wait for a table at supper time.  Good drinks and great service.  Menu has great items for everyone.  I particularly enjoy the option of creating my own plate  which is just enough food.  My husband enjoys their stuffed avocados  but also enjoys their enchiladas.  Love  Love Love their made fresh flour tortillas  I could make a meal of them alone.   We dine her often  although wish there were a location in Northwest Austin  I miss you where Kerbey Lane is now .
Tres Amigos,167,I usually order the same thing  cheese enchiladas   it s super tasty  so why mess with a good thing  right    The food is your usual Tex Mex fare.  It s consistently good and the wait for the food is never too long.  The best thing about this place are their MARGARITAS.  Boy.. they are strong and delicious.  If you order their grande margarita  make sure that you arranged for a designated driver ahead of time     We consistently drive there  across town  for their drinks. Yes  they are that awesome 
Tres Amigos,168,The food is always good and hot.  Don t forget to try the strawberry margaritas  very tasty coming from a guy that drinks beer and vodka tonics   Ask for Jorge  waiter   he is in his 70 s and still doing it 
Tres Amigos,169,My wife ordered a plate of chicken fajitas for 14.97 and she got about 8 pieces of chicken and  the bell peppers were burned. I order nachos barely had any meat and my daughter ordered tamales and the masa was dry. Keep in mind I have been going to this establishment since the 90s and since the new owners  less food more money. I wish the original owners were back again other  than that. Low quality of food with high class restaurant prices.
Tres Amigos,170,Tres Amigos is gooood  their flour tortillas are fresh made taste just like mamas. the queso dip is awesome and the fajitas are good. would recommend to anyone wanting some good TEX-MEX 
Tres Amigos,171,Best Tex-Mex in Austin hands down.  Not to mention the service is always amazing  the staff really goes the distance when catering to the customers.  I am a Vegan and they are always awesome about catering to my needs   I don t drink but whenever I have been in with people who do I see that the Ritas seem are strong because I always end up driving home   Always neat and clean  great service  great food and did I mention freshly made tortillas   Hell yes      Highly recommend this place 
Tres Amigos,172,This is not a fancy place. If you are looking for some pretty basic and good Mexican food  this place does it. We enjoyed our meals there  fine service and nice experience.
Tres Amigos,173,This restaurant is a good friend to our neighborhood  Great place to meet friends or hold a meeting or a party  -   I recommend their mushroom spinach enchiladas and margaritas.
Tres Amigos,174,The location is great. The food is really good  unless you make the mistake of ordering the dinner special . The drinks are good and the service is really good. Thanks  Toby.
Tres Amigos,175,We live near this Tres.Amigos and feel silly for not having been sooner. The wait staff have been so sweet and like to let the kids watch them make tortillas. They make them in the dining room so the place has an amazing aroma of fresh tortillas. The margaritas are good and usually well priced. So far i love the stuffed avocado and chile relleno. We will be regular customers now i expect.
Tres Amigos,176,The food looked good but we never got to taste it because it NEVER came.  We had to walk out since we were already late from lunch.  We waited 10 minutes before  they even took our drink order.
Tres Amigos,177,I come here for lunch about twice a month so I guess that makes me a regular here. The wait staff is very accomodating. They know my order and are already preparing it when they see me coming. I love their chili rellenos  queso  and cheese enchiladas. They do a decent lunch business but have never been here at dinner. The menu is a little bit pricey for what it is  but not outrageously so.
Tres Amigos,178,We had a horrible dinner this evening at the 360 location. I ordered the veggie enchiladas that was suppose to have spinach  mushroom   and black beans. It had only spinach and I m sure it was from a can. My son ordered the fish tacos that hardly had ANY fish. It was full of cilantro   We had a server named Patrick that provided less than acceptable service. Prices were as much as most GREAT  Mexican restaurants. Next time we will choose one of those. We won t be back.
Tres Amigos,179,I live near this restaurant and we eat here pretty often. I have always had a great experience  the staff and management are very personable and ready to help if there are concerns. Over all the food tastes fantastic and is well presented. The restaurant is always clean. I love the tortilla soup  which is really a steal  In fact  writing this is making me pretty hungry... on my way to Tres Amigos    
Tres Amigos,180,I ve been coming here for 20 years..Great place to eat..Love the atmosphere  the enchiladas  rice and chips..And oh..don t forget the homemade tortilla s..
Tres Amigos,181,This is the original Tres Amigos. We ate there tonight and our server rocked  Thanks Rodney   Ask for him  by the way . The queso was delicious  the cheese enchiladas really good  the tacos not as good as Amayas but still pretty good  but the fresh-made flour tortillas were out of this world  Oh yeah  Rodney recommended the black rasberry-flavorded margarita and it was wonderful  and strong  
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,1, OVERALL  The food is very unique and tasty - it was my first time trying Caribbean Latino fusion food and I loved it  The jerk chicken will change your life. I am so excited to go back and try out other dishes on their menu.   PARKING   There are two free parking lots on either side of the area. The Nyam Sunshine Cuisine food truck is parked in front of the cafe  Ani s Day and Night  and there are ample picnic tables outside. Perfect for eating outdoors with large parties and also very dog-friendly.   FOOD  I got the Jerk Chicken and was very happy with my decision. The chicken was juicy and bursting with flavor  the plantains added a nice sweetness to the dish  the Jamaican rice was savory and addicting  and the sauce complemented the dish very well. If you re looking for a hearty dish that s packed with a perfect balance of different flavors  I would highly recommend this dish 
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,2,Got the yuca bowl and jerk chicken. Both were very good  looking forward to trying the whole menu.   Tons of outdoor seating and shade shared with a bar. Doesn t get much better.
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,3,Jerk wings - wow so flavorful and tender and the avocado ranch is amazing  Yucat n taco - again so flavorful and moist chicken with delicious pineapple salsa Yucca bowl - star of the show for me. I love fried yucca. This has tender braised shredded beef over it with a slaw and pickled red onions and a sauce that was pretty damn spicy on a couple of bites - keep the water nearby but wow yum yum
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,4,This place is amazing  Great spot to chill  They are dog friendly as well  The workers here were all so friendly  Definitely will come back in the future to try other things   I got the jerk chicken and it was fantastic    The flavors were on point and authentic  The chicken was perfectly cooked. Definitely a hidden gem of Austin 
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,5,A friend told me about this place I was skeptical at first but I m in love to get island food other than my own I ll give them two thumbs up 5 stars all around
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,6,Wow  wow  wow  This place knocked my socks off   This may be the best tasting food in Austin  period  I m not sure if I ever rated a place 5 stars.   I had the jerk chicken with rice and veggies  and plantains and  OMG  what an experience.  I m not used to such perfection in the Austin area... sorry Austinites.  The chicken was moist  the skin flavorful  and cooked all the way through. The rice with pigeon peas was cooked perfectly  the veggies not under or overcooked  and the plantains were sweet... not starchy and not greasy   Nothing was over-seasoned or over-salted. The spiciness level was perfect... not too hot and not too mild... just an explosion of flavor    Yes  I m a Goldie Locks kinda person... looking for perfection  and this place was just right    Awesome food at a good price served  with a smile in an extremely clean and lovely trailer park venue. What a treat   Made my day   
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,7,Wonderful food and service   We got the corn fritters  curried goat  and the Floridian and yawdy tacos. Everything was very tasty and had a good amount of heat   .
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,8,We love this food truck and eat here at least once a month. The flavor is delicious  the ingredients are fresh and we haven t had anything we haven t liked yet. Recommendations - Corn fritters  Texan Taco and Quinoa Bowl.
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,9,Came here on a whim and pleasantly surprised with the food that we ordered   We ordered Jerk Chicken  quarter dark meat option   Coconut Shrimp  and the Corn Fritters. This was the perfect amount of food for two hungry people  The chicken was moist but could ve used more sauce on top or on the side. I loved how well rounded each meal was - veggies  carb  protein   Everything was so delicious but the corn fritters were my personal favorite. They came with a delicious creamy sauce. We will be back to try the rest of the menu 
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,10,So good  Had the Texan taco  Jamaican chicken  big portion    and the fritters- everything was delicious and I d definitely order each of them again. Plantains were delicious.   Was out of the goat curry when we went but hope to try it next time 
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,11,The Calypso Guacamole is normal  not so special.  The Tacos are just ok  the cost is  5 each but the taste is just normal. The  3 tacos near Dallas Love Field airport have much better taste with a lot more options. Not worth the price in my opinion
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,12,My husband and I stopped by Ani s for some coffee and breakfast tacos from a neighboring food truck. We decided to check out this bright yellow food trucks menu to see if it was something we might be interested in. I barely got through the appetizers and knew this was a MUST  We actually came back a few hours later specifically for this truck and had the most delicious dinner  The food  the service  the flavors    We ordered all the appetizers and some tacos  as well and let me tell you  WOW     If I wasn t flying out the next day for a trip I would have come right back the very next day. The family running this truck were beyond friendly and thankful and even the bartender from inside Ani s came out and chatted with us about how incredible this food truck is. I cannot WAIT to come back to try more of their food and when I say to just get all of the appetizers and not think twice  I mean it  And the guacamole  go calypso    This  this is a little piece of sunshine  
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,13,Nyam is incredible and the owners here are so nice  We brought our family to Ani s and had a very pleasant Sunday lunch. The goat curry just melted off the bone and was very flavorful. The shrimp rice dish was delicious and we loved the mango salad that accompanied it. The jerk chicken was tender and moist with the perfect savory  spiced  and honey-sweetened jerk rub. Not surprising since the owner used to be the GM at Fresa s. One of my favorite new food trucks.
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,14,This place is so good  Everything is so fresh and delicious. I have been here twice so far and never disappointed. Stumbled upon this gem while visiting Ani s for the first time. The folks running it are also so nice. Give them a visit and if you re blown away like me  spread the word 
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,15,The owner of the trailer is very nice and outgoing.  The food is quick and fantastic.  Every dish seems to be cooked to order w a beautiful presentation for to go food.  I ve had the jerk chicken and the coconut shrimp and they were both fantastic
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,16,This is one of the best food trucks I have ever had  The food was delicious and my wife and I couldn t choose an appetizer so we got all of them. I would definitely recommend the wings and the Roatan taco  you will not be disappointed. The staff was unbelievably nice and my wife and I joked with them by saying we would be back later this week. We definitely weren t joking and we look forward to our next visit as soon as humanly possible. In a sea of food trucks in Austin we have definitely found a Caribbean gem 
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,17,Delicious jamaican food  I had the quinoa bowl with jerk chicken and I m elated. I also appreciate their order ahead functionality. Really convenient to order online and pickup on my way home.
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,18,Had the quinoa salad bowl  very fresh  very delicious and very reasonably priced. Highly recommend
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,19,Such a tasty meal from Nyah  We ordered the half jerk chicken  fritters and the Texas taco. The chicken was tender  juicy and perfectly spiced and fritters were sweet and crunchy.  The courtyard and seating in the outdoor patio area is well maintained.  Highly recommend.
Nyam Sunshine Cuisine,20,What a sweet surprise  My guy and I enjoyed the vibes  beautiful sunset and by the far the best food truck in town  From the corn fritters  variety of tacos and quinoa bowl... All delicious   Please support this amazing business and enjoy this hidden gem in a cultural pocket off the beaten path. LOVE 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,1,Never have left a review before  but let me just say this...fire  Chips came out warm  salsa was on point  drinks were cheap and strong. Feels like a weekly pull-up spot fasho 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,2,BOMB BREAKFAST TACOS   You will not feel like you need eleventeen of them to get full. Great daily special. 3 tacos  2 ingredients each for 3.99   WOOHOO   Can t wait to try lunch and dinner  Here s an idea. Go here for breakfast and then hop across the street to do your grocery shopping. Then you re not buying all that stuff you don t need cuz you hungy. It s a win-win 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,3,One of my favorite hidden spots. Great service  food and price  Whether it be for coffee and a taco or dinner to go  this establishment makes you feel like home. Enjoy 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,4,Dang  last review I did for this place was 2009. In my defense Texas has plenty of Mex-Tex-Mex offerings. Back in the day  this strip mall in South Austin had a few offerings including my breakfast fave Lone Star Kolaches.   Can t remember exactly when an Indian joint came online. I do recall a pho place which I didn t like that much. Main reason for hanging here was the Firestone in the same complex   parking lot. You know  the 5 hour wait for an alignment    GF and I were sitting at home riding out the recent hell hath frozen Austin over watching No Reservations. Good one too where Bourdain visits Del Rio  and makes his way in and out of Mexico all the way to Laredo eating street tacos among other cuisine.   While she wasn t impressed with the sushi restaurant with rattlesnake whiskey she did say she missed street tacos at Taco Cabana. Babe  I can do you one better  second day when temps went up we jumped in the truck for supplies and food.   Locals eating HUGE bowls of menudo  welcome to your famalia substitute for fast food. Mole enchiladas while good weren t as good as our last Alpine  Texas adventure. Al Pastor tacos on corn tortillas were better than the burnt  Bistek  steak offerings.   Since the nearby Austin based Tex-Mex powerhouse Chuy s has dumped Chili Rellenos off the menu...I might just make Taqueria La Famalia a regular in our dining rotation. Thanks for being open and inviting  great service too. Won t take 10 years to come back.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,5,Actually have been having good luck on deliveries and even the occasional dine in. Parking spaces are really small so if you go  take the Smart Car. Note that the food is not hard core Tex Mex and you may need to ask for Jalapeno or more hot sauce. They do use fresh jalapeno with is sometimes a good deal. Some dishes are bland and require my own hot sauce. One downturn was the Mole   which we found to be pretty good in the past. Last time we had it  a bit grainy it was.  Could have been an off day. We have adjusted to the restaurant and what the forth star is for is that you can ask for any variable on an item if you are there and there are a number of ala carte items you can customize. Staff has always been nice.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,6,I am so disappointed.  I have been going to this restaurant for more than half my life. Started eating here when I was only about 14yrs old and used to be a multiple time a week regular. I know the owner s family very well. And I have always loved it.  They have really let me down tonight.  Not only have their prices gone up beyond their value  but tonight I had a really bad experience.  The waitress spilled salsa all the way across the restaurant that got on my white shorts  and I let it go because accidents happen. But when we went to pay we were charged full price for our margaritas  on  2.50 margarita mondays simply because they were flavored. I have never in my life had to pay full price for a flavored margarita on margarita Monday. Our bill should have been  40  but instead we paid over  80. Never again. RIP La Familia.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,7,Friends introduced us to this family restaurant. We go once a week happy hour goes from 4 to 7 daily they have some of the best margaritas and they re not too sweet wonderful margaritas..The chicken fajitas are the very best and on Tuesday you get the fajitas for two for the price of fajitas for one. The food is excellent and the service is friendly we are so glad we found this restaurant Judy s
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,8,Pros  Delicious and fresh food. Everything we ve tried has been delicious. Good potion sizes. Service is fast and friendly.  Cons  Can be a bit of a wait for a table to open up  meaning they stay busy . Wish they offered a Caldo de Res  because if they did  I m sure it be amazing .   We ve tried all their soups  tortilla  posole  and menudo  and they were all very good.   Their salsa and chips are great. The tacos are great. This has become our  go-to nearby Mexican place.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,9,I love this little place but too often forget about it as it is a bit hidden.  They have great lunch specials that in my opinion are UNDER priced.   5.99 for an enchilida  taco  rice  beans  chips and salsa AND tea.    They have a daily special plus about 8 other lunches.  Never been here for breakfast but I d give it a shot.   Give this little place a try.  I don t think you will be disappointed.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,10,This is a great little Mexican restaurant  with reasonable prices  and nice daily specials. Anytime I find my self in south Austin  I look forward to La Familia 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,11,I am not even sure why the wifey was so enamored to eat here and we generally rarely go out for breakfast  regardless she dragged me out to try.  Located in a non-descript shopping center  the surroundings are very la de dah.  Three televisions and a check out kiosk rather than paying at the table.  Somewhat old school as was most of the patrons who were dining on a Friday morning.  Delighted to find out they had a full bar  well they served Bloody Mary s at least.  Why is it that when I don t see a bar or my drink being made  i get a little nervous   That is the case here and I can report the Bloody Mary was fine  not loaded up with a bunch of crap  salted rim good mix and vodka.  I get the feeling that the vodka was nothing more than Kamchatka or something like that.  Who knows  it hit the spot.  Chips and Salsa arrived and it reminded me of the chips salsa from the mid 80 s.  Salsa was commercially sourced somewhere it seemed.  Chips fine.  Ordered up the Huevos Rancheros with my eggs once over.  This dish came out with Refried Beans and Spuds  Eggs cooked well  runny yolks mixing it up with the Ranchero sauce and the torts were also on point to sop up the rest of the meal.    Everything was ok somewhat pedestrian and that s fine. Price was very affordable and it feels like a place that folks around our neighborhood have been enjoying for years  many regulars being welcomed and embraced.  Service was attentive with smiles  can t really ask for anything more.  Not so sure we will be back since we drove by Hecho en Mexico on the way and I have yet to have breakfast there.  When I asked wifey why she wanted to try it so much  she mentioned she heard it was great from her Next Door app.  Enough said  Next Door raves about our neighborhood Dominoes Pizza.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,12,Genuine home cooking and honest to goodness Tex-Mex food. What I love most is the great service that you receive. The tortillas are fresh and homemade and they have a really great variety of foods that you have grown accustomed to eating here in Texas.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,13,I think they have the best breakfast tacos and the best breakfast taco deal. I don t get here enough but was glad to see they are still open. The tamales and enchiladas are wonderful too and the staff is very friendly
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,14,I really like their mini tacos and shrimp tacos. The shrimp tacos have a ton of flavor. Their queso is really just cheddar cheese and not my jam. Margaritas are super strong ... so be careful  I guess. Tacos are like  3 which is crazy good
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,15,Tried this place for the first time last night and the food was terrific.  Way better than Maudie s or Chuy s.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,16,It s really hard to disappoint me when it comes to Mexican food  but this place does. Honestly  this morning is the only time I can remember having a frown on my face while eating Mexican food in my life. The refried beans tasted like they came straight out of a can with no seasoning added  the rice was bland and burnt  and the chicken enchiladas were just plain bad. The bistek wasn t bad  but it s near impossible to mess up skirt steak saut d with tomatoes  onions  and peppers. I can not overstate how terrible the rice and beans tasted.       This was my second time eating here. The first time honestly wasn t bad. I had the menudo. It was pretty good. Could definitively be better  but it was pretty good. Would definitely order that again.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,17,Wow  I found Mexico in south Austin. I love the diner atmosphere. No long wait for a table. Exceptional service. The servers seamed genuinely happy to serve. I had Chalupas with an enchilada  rice and beans. Very nice meal. The salsa was fresh with just the right amount of heat. The Corona was ice cold. We will be back. And I love the Latin music. And I love that the restaurant is quiet enough to have a nice conversation over dinner. Our server also helped me get on WiFi so I could get on a zoom conference call after dinner.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,18,I m so sad I ve apparently moved out of delivery range for this place. They are inexpensive and delicious. I used to order their burrito with barbacoa  it s tastier later in the day  and it would last me for two meals.   I tried getting something similar at a burrito place from lunch drop at work one time. It was a larger burrito  but did not keep me full all day or taste nearly as awesome. It was twice the price. So sad.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,19,I am impressed with this place. The customer service is top notch. The salsa is amazing  and I m super picky about my salsa. They do not let your chips and salsa basket go empty  and they serve warm chips too  I think this is my new go-to spot.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,20,This is a nice quiet family restaurant  that deserves more business and attention  especially on a Friday evening when other places are packed.  The food  the chips and the salsa is fresh.  The prices are very reasonable.  I had a chimichanga and corona.  My wife had a combination plate.  We both left very satisfied and well served.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,21,Standard good Mexican restaurant.  Good was average. Limonada was really great and refreshing.   I got the cheese enchiladas. Rice and beans were not fresh but not funky.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,22,Well  definitely a fan...Place was fairly busy  service was good as expected...Waiting and Busing by the only 2 people on the floor  yet they smiled and kept the chips full. Bowl of Queso  was filling to say the least  Salsa had a great flavor. Food did take a bit to come out  but when it did  it was well worth the wait. .BFYB  Bang For Your Buck  was the first thing we both noticed. Very fair price for a huge plate of food. Good ...Yes  very...Being our first visit..we hit the Chiladas ...Beef with Chipolte Sauce  and Chicken with Poblano sauce  which I rarely see on any menu. The chipotle sauce caught my wifes taste buds off guard with a Kick. She loved it   Lips on Fire by the time she finished. We both really like the Rice  fresh and fluffy...The Poblano sauce was drop the mic GOOD   ...Its nice to have something different for once...It will be in my sites at any other place we visit. Had a great Visit for sure and would recommend trying   Bit of a drive for us  but will keep it book marked just in case we are in the area again..
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,23,This is one of those trusty  go to  neighborhood places that my husband and I like to eat at.  On the weekend mornings expect a short wait but the wait is worth it. The huevos rancheros and Mexicana plate are delicious. My husband s regular breakfast order is the 3 taco special with a side of  ranchero sauce. If you are craving menudo  ask for a small cup as it ll hit the spot quick enough.  Drink specials..yes...don t forget the drink specials. They have different specials during the week that are sure to wet your whistle. Can t turn down  1.99 margaritas and beer in Mondays and that is just to start your week.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,24,Always have a staff with a great attitude and good Mexican food. I love supporting local businesses. This establishments make AUSTIN special.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,25,This place is really fancy for a Mexican restaurant.  Custom everything.  The food was okay  average and nothing really stood out from the other Mexican restaurants.  I had a sampler breakfast plate that had a little bit of everything  and my son had the nachos.  The service was great and there was plenty of seating.  The location is great too....off Brodie Ln.  I may come back to try something new.  I would like to see their lunch and happy menu.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,26,Best lunch deal in South Austin  Plus  I love their salsa and their chicken enchiladas. Service is friendly  prompt  and they ll give you extra salsa if you ask....love getting the  to go  tea cup. They do a great job 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,27,If you are looking for food that will change that humans walk  you re at the wrong place.  If you are looking for solid food and strong margaritas  then you re at right place.   Food is always hot and margs are always frozen and strong.  Perfect cheap lunch spot with  5.99 lunch specials. I think its the best way tonstartbthe weekend.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,28,Family owned joint in South Austin. It is very affordable and the service is decent. I had ordered the chicken and shrimp fajitas which was a very large portion. The chicken was a bit dry but the shrimp were good. A bit better than most Mexican restaurants in the area  but again we are in Austin so it is more Tex Mex than just Mex. My bf ordered the barbacoa tacos which he really enjoyed and at  3 a taco  you really can t beat it.   Not sure I would go out of my way to go again  but wouldn t oppose if a friend suggested it for a night out for dinner or lunch.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,29,When I hear taqueria I think a quick stop  but this place is setup like a restaurant. Just wanted a few flautas   1.25 each for a little side of guacamole and sour cream.. . Cheaper just to get the meal. Ordered to go and it s taking for ever.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,30,This small unassuming restaurant serves delicious custom cooking at affordable prices. I love the Mole for dinner  and the best Barbacoa for breakfast.  Heads up   1.99 Margs on Monday night 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,31,Stopped here for breakfast on the way out of town. Nothing great  just a local place. Chips are a dollar and you have to ask for them - pretty sure the chips were baked Tostitos and salsa was Pace.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,32,This place is pretty good. I ve never been disappointed when I go. I can t say its   gotta try it and don t pass it up  but it s pretty darn good. Food is always fresh and tasty  Only downfall for me is the store bought tortillas but otherwise pretty darn good and it s never packed but they have steady business and the staff has always been great 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,33,I can t claim to know tu familia  only mi familia  and as such  when I take a flier and dive into a strip mall eatery for a last minute  but quite necessary  late morning brekkie you ll understand that I have scarcely the time to chat. I have a face  and goal one is to stuff it.   Fast forward a little and you may find yourself in the confines of this English-friendly local chomp spot  and as a bonus they tend to make things extra easy for ya  breakfast  lunch and dinner seem to be readily made at any time  and our waitress  though she appeared to be super new on the job  popped in regularly and was super friendly. It s a spartan space  and I don t think most would be surprised at any lack of sophistication therein  I emerged with a decent breakfast  eggs and barbacoa if you were wondering   some orange juice  and a decent but not transcendent pina agua fresca. It provided a decent start to our day. And I can t say we ll beat the door down to get back in here  but I really loved the attitude of the place. Next time  I m going after the skirt steak -
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,34,I m not one to write bad reviews... we went to dinner here last night with the family. The rice was cold  the fajita meat was over cooked and chewy and no flavor. I m not hard to please with fajitas but they were bad... even my 5.5 year old wouldn t eat it.  The kicker was my husband had ordered a soup and when he was just about done he FOUND A FINGERNAIL  How does that even happen  Beyond gross.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,35,Was looking for a quick place for lunch and it was amazing  Queso and salsa was so good. Food was cheap but the quality was great   10 10 would recommend
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,36,This is a little cozy mexican restaurant that is cheap and good. It s tucked away behind firestone on William Cannon  and may be easily missed.   We always stick to our normal orders    6.99 enchilada plate - comes with rice and beans and your choice of shreaded chicken  ground beef or cheese. They also have a chili con carne sauce they pour over - delicious    Plato combo ado  6.99 - comes with avocado salad  rice and beans. You can choose 2 types of meat  chicken  beef or al pastor. We always get 2x al pastor because it s full of flavor and tender  If you look in your local community papers  they often have coupons for buy on get one half off  And they provide complimentary chips and salsa while you wait for your food  I hate places that nickle and dime you 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,37,Came in this morning with my toddler for breakfast. Food flavors are very good  food presentation is simple  no garnish or placements  just good home cooked food.  Service could use a touch up. Sit anywhere the host says and that means grab your own high chair even if your arms are full of diaper bags And toddlers.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,38,Y all  the mole is off the actual chain. Insanely delicious. Just go get it immediately  try the mole enchiladas .
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,39,I ve lived in the area for 6 years and I m regretfully JUST NOW checking this place out. Could have been because of it s sort-of-hidden location  but once a glimpse of this place did catch my eye  my sucker for small Mexican restaurants self couldn t wait to give it a try.  My Monday lunch wasn t met with a usual Friday night crowd which I tend to prefer. The waitress was very nice and welcoming. I had no idea I came in on the day they have  1.99 margaritas. I m sorry  what    Yes  ALL DAY on Mondays  their margaritas  including my 2..or 3   beer and wine are  1.99. If that doesn t automatically plan out your next Monday lunch  no judgement   or dinner plans...  Definitely took advantage of their great lunch specials. I ordered a beef fajita taco  w  grilled onions and pepper   which I just ended up throwing on top of my delicious cheese enchiladas. The salsa went amazing mixed in with their refried beans and the tortillas definitely didn t taste like they were right out of a package.   Very affordably priced  food and drink.  I can t wait to come back soon and try the rest of the menu 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,40,The best pastor in town although it has no pineapple. Split the pastor street taco appetizer  mounds of pork with grilled onion  cilantro  and a large grilled jalaeno. The cook  Robert  and his wife own and operate the place. Many family members work there also. Ask Robert how Real Madrid is playing. Might get you a bigger taco 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,41,This is one of my favorite places to eat breakfast. Unlike the overcrowded kerby lane cousin down the street this place is small and quite and cheap. They serve your favorite breakfast tacos and some mexican versions that you dont find everywhere. They have good pancakes and excellent horchata. Its one of the few places in austin for cheap good food.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,42,La Familia has the best Tex-mex in town. The lunch special is an incredible value and the women in the FOH are very sweet and attentive. Would recommend to introduce the uninitiated to classic Tex-mex. Great experience 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,43,We are from San Antonio and were looking for the small joint place  for really good Mexican food. After yelp review  decided on this place.  Not real fancy but food was excellent. Sunday special was menudo and 2 awesome barbacoa tacos  no one does that special. My husband said it was great. Charro beans  refried  or black beans are the option for your beans we had charro and they were steamy hot and very good. Mexican rice was fluffy and very good. Enchiladas were really good  lots of cheese inside and out and had a good flavor. The 5 street taco barbacoa plate was excellent  had charred jalape o and sweet grilled  onions with it and it was all good. It is hard to find good barbacoa that Is not floating in grease  and this was prepared well. We had complementary chips and salsa that never ran out. Ordered guacamole and it was made well  in SA  you get very little on a plate of shredded  lettuce  not here   it was all guacamole. We noticed  1.99 Monday margaritas so we ordered one to taste it. It was  4.99 regular price  happy hour is more then that in SA  it was very good and stayed frozen. We will make this a regular stop when we go to South Austin area. Service was excellent and food was served fresh and quick.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,44,Food was disappointing  to say the least.  I ordered a Milanesa torta  and the meat was so tough and chewy it was practically inedible.  I left an embarrassing mess on my plate from trying to rip through my food with my teeth.  At one point  the manager and two different servers saw me struggling  with my meal but never asked if my meal was okay.  My receipt also showed it was also priced  2 above what their menu stated.  Secondly  even by TexMex standards  their salsa was too mild--almost like a tomato pur e instead of a salsa--and their queso tasted like a melted block of plain Velveeta cheese.  On a different note  the servers were polite and it appeared like they had a bit of an established clientele.  Maybe I just happened to order the worst thing on the menu that day   I won t be back to find out.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,45,I m only rating the food-- normally I reserve 4 stars for something with a bit of ambiance  which this humble taqueria lacks but then again  it s a taqueria.  The food is good and well priced. My Negro Modelo was very cold and did I mention they have vegetarian options   I let my server choose for me. As one of the  family  I figured she knew best.  She enthusiastically met my challenge  serving me enchiladas with a yummy zucchini filling  under fabulous verde sauce. Tomatillo but without the side of sugar most Tex-Mex joints add.  The black beans were good  the rice was meh... I ve had better  I ll go back  a lot.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,46,In a city known for tacos  it s hard to beat La Familia. Prices are great  establishment is clean and tacos are amazing
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,47,On a Wednesday night I had to pick a restaurant to eat at as my last solid food meal for a week. I was getting 4 teeth pulled the next day. I knew I wanted Mexican food  good drinks and cheap prices. This restaurant was recommended to me.  When we arrived around 7 30 I noticed the place was very small  not much decor and not very many people. I was expecting this since I asked for a cheap place  The boyfriend and I started with salsa and queso. Salsa wasnt spicy at all  which is fine. I am a huge queso fan. We got the small size and it wasn t the best but it wasn t horrible either. A little thick if you like that. At this point we ordered a strawberry Margarita and a Margarita on the rocks. Small drinks  but very strong. Will go back for more drinks    We ordered our food. I got the Plato combinado with all pastor and ground beef. The boyfriend got the mole enchiladas. Our plates came out quickky. However  i requested flour tortillas and a side of shredded cheese and did not get it until the boyfriend was halfway done with his meal. The two servers working must have been between 18-20 years old and we re not very attentive.   I thought the AL pastor was yummy but the ground beef lacked in flavor as well as the rice. The charro beans were nice and flavorful. The Boyfriend Really Enjoyed His mole enchiladas but thought the flavor became too rich after 1 1 2 enchiladas.   We asked for our check and waited another 5 minutes before that was brought. There was only 3 other people in the restaurant. My plate was only  6.99 and the boyfriends was  8.99. We were impressed with the amount of food we got for that price. we waited another 5 minutes for the waiter to pick up our tab before we were tired of waiting and went to the front to stand and wait to pay. We noticed they didn t charge us for the queso  but I believe that was a mistake because they weren t paying attention and not to comp us for wait time as nothing had been said  not even a sorry for the wait.   Overall  I would go again just for the margaritas or when I m very hungry and on a budget. The service could definitely improve as well as the decor.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,48,Had my gf get food from here for the first time and they ignored her for 10mnts before even asking to take her order.  Ate a quesadilla and it was way to spicy which that wasnt mentioned in their menu.  I would never go here again.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,49,The close-by Kerbey Lane at lunch time on Saturday had a super long wait so we opted tried this Mexican place instead.  The staff was very nice and it didn t take long to get seated and order. Prices were cheap but I didn t notice anything special with the food. The tortillas seemed authentic but the rice and beans could have been from a can  not sure. Also I didn t like how close the tables were to each other as I was almost bumping elbows with the next table over. A pick-up order of beef or chicken fajitas here is a better option than Taco C or Taco B but thats not saying much
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,50,Amazing breakfast tacos    Great brunch dining experience with mimosas and micheladas and those awesome tacos.  Out the door for a little over  20 for two including beverages.  My coworkers go here and bring a big bag of breakfast tacos to the salon sometimes and it makes the morning awesome.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,51,Excellent food and fantastic service  I will definitely come back  Best Mexican food I ve had in Austin 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,52,Exceptional food and service. The prices were extremely fair as well. Nothing like homemade Mexican food. 10 10
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,53,Food was good. Service was prompt. I come from a place where Mexican food is just Mexican food. This place is more of a tex-mex flare.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,54,A solid three star mom and pop local joint. Very reasonably priced    Yelp forces us to type more to be a review not a tip. There s a tip
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,55,This little strip mall Tex-Mex cafe is hidden behind Hollywood Video on William Cannon.  I have been going to Pho Tai Son  in the same strip  for years and only recently noticed this place.  What I really like about this place besides the fact that I can walk or ride my bike here is their cooking method.  Everything seems a lot less greasy than most Tex-Mex.  The Chicken Flautas are grilled not fried and the Barbacoa tacos are full of flavor minus the grease.  And the prices are cheap cheap 2.99 Migas with sides of refried beans and fried potatoes is a great deal.  The Vegetarian  Enchiladas are my favorite so far - corn tortillas packed with corn  squash  tomatoes and onions topped with lots of cheese and green sauce with choice of beans and rice  I do not like rice so I get both the charro and refried beans all for a measly 5.49.  The Chicken Flautas are also yummy and 5.49 and come 3 on a bed of shredded lettuce  guacamole and sour cream and sides of rice and beans.  Some facts  The place seems to be family owned - I know 2 of the waitresses are sisters.  There are only about 10 tables but there is never a wait.  The dishes are not as spicy as I like but they bring 3 different salsas to the table so you can adjust the heat.  They do not take American Express but they trusted me enough to let me walk to Bank of America  in the same parking lot  to withdraw some cash.  The taste is a good 3 stars but they get an extra star for being healthy  not greasy  and close to my casa which makes them even cheaper  because I do not have to drive here.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,56,Typical Tex-Mex nothing special. I guess you would like this place if your a big fan of re-fried beans. I found it mediocre at best. The price is the only selling point here. This place is better than taco bell or taco cabana and has just about the same price point. If your looking for cheap Tex-Mex eat here. If your looking for good Tex-Mex go to Maudies 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,57,Not the best Tex-Mex  but certainly not the worst  either.  The salsa was wonderful with almost a sweet after taste. My Negra Modelo was nice and cold. The queso was a bit watery. We tried to figure out what was in it to make it so  but weren t quite sure. It was just blah.   I had some sort of grilled chicken  with veggies and black beans. The black beans were good  but those are easy  right   Service was good  people were friendly. I know someone who knows someone who owns  or works   here and was really hoping for more.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,58,I stopped in here for lunch after an errand at Circle C. I used to live in the area so its interesting to stop by once and awhile and see what s changed.  La Familia is a clean and shiny taqueria without the hole-in-the-wall vibe of some other places I frequent. Prices are reasonable  but slightly higher than other places with this type of menu  entrees in the  8-9 range . Pricing probably reflects the location and the nicer feel of the restaurant.  Working from the a la carte portion of the menu  I tried an al pastor burrito   3.99  for lunch and was pleased with the size  on the large end of the spectrum . It was fairly tasty  but I have a minor complaint - what s up with the pineapple   I ve had al pastor with and without the obvious pineapple flavor. Sometimes it s over the top - like Curra s and other times non-existant. A quick search of teh interwebs shows that pineapple is a pretty standard ingredient  but I wonder if some folks just over-do it.    In La Familia s case  the al pastor pork was very tasty  but the pineapple made the burrito too sweet overall.  I think some very-spicy salsa could have fixed this up nicely perhaps.  Speaking of salsa - other reviewers mentioned 3 salsa choices. I was only offered one salsa that was OK  but lacking in Zazz. If I had known they had other options I would have asked for them.  3 stars for now - worth a return trip next time I m in the neighborhood.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,59,Apparently I ve been remiss in not writing a review in sometime. My apologies.   I ll keep this simple. It s cheap  it s small  the food is solid and happy hours are pennies on the dollar. But the best part is the staff. . .   Since I live around the corner  I often wake at 5 or so in the morning feeling somewhat rough from the previous nights shennanigans. But I call them up at 6 o clock sharp and say  I need to place a pick up order . And it s the same girl every damn morning  and after about 5 times she just started answering and all she would say is  Hi Mr. Brasky. It will be ready in 5 minutes.  I think I might love her. Breakfast tacos  an order of 3  super cheap and oh so tasty. And the salsa is on par.  Seriously  if you re ever down that way and don t eat there  well . . . . you know what happens.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,60,This is an after-church tradition for my family  I have to say  we always come back for the service.  Family owned and operated  you can t find a group with a kinder exposition toward the customer.  As far as the food goes  there hasn t been anything to complain about for me yet.  Salsa is very spicy  great for me  but not for everyone  and the rice and beans are flavorful with a nice texture  Mexican rice should have a bite    The tacos al pastor simply cannot be touched.  Not the best Tex-Mex I ve ever had in the world  but I ll pick La Familia over other restaurants because of  well  la familia.  Cheesy but true.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,61,First time for lunch.. breakfast  some time back  was good.  I was south  called Him  said how about lunch.  He was on Brodie  it seemed like a good idea.  And it was.   6 for lunch  including tea.  Awesome salsa.  Really good  with a kick.    A variety of lunch specials  and I m almost ashamed to say I opted for the  2  2 cheese enchiladas  rice  and beans.   We both did.   Order them with onions on top.  So much better.  They offer GRILLED chicken flautas.  I was very tempted.  The service is EXCELLENT.  The restaurant is clean.  And the food is good Tex-Mex.   It s late at night  and I wish I had the other half of an enchilada I didn t eat.    If you re in the neighborhood  try it.  There s an interesting Indian market next door.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,62,Three and a half stars  Really  If I wasn t so hungry right now I d be laughing. Maybe the fact that the restaurant was less than half empty should have been a sign to back out slowly...slowly...then make a run for the car. I guess this is what I get for cheating on Chuy s and trying out a strip mall version of Mexican food.   Definitely not worth the hype.  The lady ringing us up and giving us our to-go order was nice enough  but we had to wait a long time for our food  even though we had called it in fifteen minutes before we entered the establishment  and that was how long she quoted us until it would be ready. The needless wait to get our food as it was sitting on the counter was probably the reason why when we got home we discovered the food was cold.   We got loads of tortilla chips  which were crispy  but they gave us four little cartons of the type of salsa you could get at the grocery store. It was bland and spiceless.   So I m now kicking myself for not getting a larger entree  but since I was exercising extreme restraint in not indulging too much  I thought the Mom s Plate would be a light but filling meal. Uh  wrong.   First of all  the menu says that it comes with guacamole  queso  an enchilada  and a taco. I open up my to go box  and the portions of each are so small  I thought it was a kids  menu entree. Seriously. The cheese enchilada was literally the size of my hand  cool  flat as a pancake  with flavorless suiza sauce  and cheese thinly spread throughout. I had a few bites of it and knew that it would have had some flavor if it had not been cold. The crispy taco was anything but. I picked it up  took a bite  and it fell apart  The shell was limp  cold  and watery. Its contents of lettuce  beef  tomatoes were the same temperature  hence the lack of flavor. The queso was awesome  and the quacamole was okay  although not fresh  but I thought that I d get a big scoop of both  considering they were part of the  6.99 meal. Instead  I get one small carton of each.  sigh   We also ordered the Quesadilla Especial appetizer  which came with four flat quesadillas which  when picked upyou guessed it they fell apart  Little pieces of beef and a slathering of cheese just yawned out of the tortilla. I had to chase them around with the fork because they wouldn t go back into the flimsy excuse of a quesadilla tortilla. Another disappointment.  And finally  my boyfriend s beef fajitas  according to him  were salty. He nicknamed his fajita tortillas   baby tacos  because they looked the size you would give a little kid. He also was sorely disappointed with the portion size of his dinner  and now we are still nursing partially empty bellies  thanks to La Familia.   11th Commandment Proposal  Thou shalt never cheat on Chuy s.   Believe me  I learned my lesson.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,63,So I drive by this place a lot. I always wondered if it was good. But it looked like a hole in the wall. I love hole in the walls  but unless I m introduced to them  worry about how dirty they are. So one day randomly talking to a friend  I asked him if he knew this place and he said he had just gone there and it was great.   So with a referral  I went in there and ordered a combo plate. Let s be safe and start with something that I can try a mix of. I had al pastor meat  bistek and tried a sample of what I believe is called milanesa    . Anyhow  it turned out to be great and I go back routinely. I asked the cashier once if they had other restaurants and this is their only one. I m guessing the people I see there are the owners family. They have been nice to me every time. Also I tried something once that had cactus in it. I never thought about eating a cactus  but now I do every time I see one 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,64,You ll find La Familia in an unassuming strip mall on William Cannon near MoPac. The restaurant itself is even more unassuming  but squeaky clean.  I get the feeling this is a family business  mom  sisters  and so on   and la familia is muy friendly. They serve really good  basic  fresh Tex-Mex at bargain prices. I love the salsa  which is super-hot.   The beef fajitas are a standout - super-flavorful and tender.  Don t pass this place up. It s unassuming  but deserves your attention.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,65,This place is fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time. Everything is fresh and tasty  And it s cheap and fast. If you like small diners with great food  check this place out.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,66,I came here to check out some more breakfast tacos after my co worker brought some to the office from the Monday breakfast special. I really liked them. My visit was pleasant  service was good and quick. My Bacon  egg  and cheese filled the tortilla and the 2 cheese was melted over the eggs. This is my new breakfast taco spot 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,67,We go here irregularly for the breakfast.  Stick with the La Familia taco and you can t go wrong.  I ve not eaten lunch there  but all the breakfast items I ve had are awfully good.    I know it s heresy  but the La Familia breakfast taco is better  in my book  than any of the 3 breakfast tacos I ve eaten at Taco Deli.    Wait staff is friendly and service is fast.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,68,Great food. I ve been coming to this place for a while now. They never disappoint. Small spot. The parking sucks but that s not their fault.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,69,Always fast  hot  delicious and ridiculously cheap. Breakfast is served all day and we often get breakfast tacos to-go. The staff is friendly  too.   Unfortunately  the storefront is hidden away behind Hollywood Video  so know where you re going. It s a few spots down from Thundercloud.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,70,This is our favorite neighborhood Mexican place. Great food  great value  and friendly service.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,71,We ve been here quite a few times and usually because we want mexican food. It s hard to find an authentic mexican restaurant  normally its tex-mex around Austin.   La Familia is good  cheap and close by  You should always check their special board behind the register. Our waitress says they change it weekly. I usually get their taco plates but I recently just started ordering from their  a la carte  section. How can you say no to a burrito for  3.99 The husband and I really like the al pastor. The barbacoa is pretty good too. My husband said the bistek is a bit salty. They provide unlimited chips and salsa. Note  sometimes the salsa is spicy  the way we like it  and others... it s just mild.   One thing I don t like about the location is the parking. The parking spaces are extremely tight.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,72,This is very close to my home and the food is great. My favorite is the Saturday special. My only complaint is the service it s horrible the waitress walk around like zombies no smiles they look like they hate to be there. They will walk by your table never asking if you need anything walk by with empty glasses and never pick up empty dishes. I ll always go back because the food is good but until the wait staff up their game tips will be low.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,73,Went for lunch. Food was fresh  very good and very reasonable. We sat ourselves and the waitress brought our menus as soon as we sat down. Large selection to choose from. I ordered the Carne Guisada and it was more red in color than I have ever had. It was delicious and the meat was extremely tender. Rice was good  it did not taste like it had been sitting for awhile and refried beans were also very good. I wasn t asked so I assumed flour tortillas would be served but I was served corn tortillas. I didn t ask for flour so I settled for the corn tortillas and I am glad I did.  I can t wait to go back.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,74,Some of the BEST breakfast tacos in Austin.  Monday they are 3 for  2    That deal is nearly impossible to beat    My favorites are   Potato Egg   Cheese Chorizo   Potato   Cheese Bean and Cheese.    NOTE  Egg whites available on request for no additional charge 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,75,Price is good. The food is OK too but always consistent. I would suggest each time you come you try something new. Parking is hard in the shopping center and most spots are for little cars. Take your time and enjoy a good meal. Place is seat your self with minimal wait staff so do not look for a smile and a thank you cause they are over worked. Not the best food in town but you will be please when you see the price.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,76,I originally went to Chuy s and there was an hour long wait so we opened Yelp and saw this play was near by. First let me tell you...the prices are AMAZING. The food was perfect. I got a plate with a taco  enchilada and queso. Everything was on point  hot  good flavor. Between two people who got two entree plates and two breakfast tacos we paid 17.00 total. WOW  No wait  good food. This will be our go to from now on 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,77,Mediocre Tex-Mex.  Friendly service.  That s all I got.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,78,This was a really gross experience. I rarely refuse to finish a meal  but it was so greasy and tasted so canned. The enchiladas were tasteless and the tamales were grainy and tasted like dirt. When you cant even finish the guac or  queso   its bad food.  I would rather eat Taco Bell.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,79,We have been eating at La Familia for years. We found it about 6 months after it opened and have gone weekly since. The food is good Tex Mex and very reasonably priced. The breakfast tacos are yummy  which is what my husband eats . I love the fajita tacos on corn shells....mmmmm. This is one of the few mid to inexpensive restaurants in town that can accommodate my family for our birthday dinners  there are 14 of us  without charging us for a party room  kudos to the staff when we are all there...lol . It is definitely a place I recommend to anyone.  Sherry
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,80,La Familia is the closest Mexican food restaurant to my house. The first few times I went  the food was really good. Then I went one time  and the food was really mediocre  dinner . Gave it another chance and it was ok  lunch . Chance 3 and it was terrible again  breakfast--gross   . They have run out of chances with me.  Service was always great and their horchata is excellent but I must continue the search...
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,81,Like comfortable clothes you swear you won t wear is you local mexican restaurant.  So I tried La Familia back on. Back to what it was  Food was great  I am a sucker for a great tortilla soup and theirs was great. The best part and the one thing that drove me away was the service which has improved greatly. So if you have put them away try them on again. I did and was happy to have my local comfortable tex mex back thank God it still fits.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,82,Went to this restaurant to try a new place and while it wasn t bad  it s definitely not great. I had a burrito with ground beef and didn t care for the seasonings  it was pretty bland.  I didn t like the rice at all  my mother had a bone in her chicken enchilada  and my dad made the  stink face  when he ate the charro beans.  The good thing is that the staff is friendly and it s a quiet atmosphere.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,83,My family and I dine here often.  It s our little Tex Mex hole in the wall.  The food is solid  and the service is fantastic.  You can tell many of the employees are family.  The prices are great.    The breakfast tacos are very good and pretty cheap.  They re bigger than most  so order accordingly.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,84,I would NOT recommend this restaurant.  I called in an order the day before  as requested by restaurant  to pick up twelve breakfast tacos at 6 30 for a business meeting this morning. I gave my cell number for follow-up.  When I arrived at 6 32  no one was there to greet me.  I received a call a few minutes later from the restaurant telling me that they had just arrived and my order was NOT ready.  This put me in a pickle cause I needed to be at work before 7am.   While I was waiting for my order to be completed  several other people that walked in received their order. Also  while I was waiting  the waitress was playing with her long black hair and then put it up in a pony tail right there in the kitchen area and did NOT wash her hands. I brought that to her attention and she just shrugged her shoulders. I finally got my order at 7 15am. NO apologies  NO discount for the long wait....NOTHING    This restaurant was recommended by a family member. After my experience today   I will not return to this restaurant.  I would NOT recommend to other family and friends.  There are a lot better places to eat than this place.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,85,I m definitely a fan of this place  ever since my first visit. As others have mentioned it is in a strip mall but the taste is genuine  high-quality  yet  home-cooked  Tex Mex. To keep it simple  here are the highlights  1  Family-owned so staff is friendly  helpful  and accommodating 2  Salsa  queso and chips  a staple in any Tex-Mex restaurant  are all top-notch 3  The place is quiet with very few patrons. This is a great place to take your family without fear that your noisy kids will disrrupt all the other diners. At the same time  even without kids it s nice to have a server with only one or two tables. 4  Awesome Happy Hour prices.  2 margaritas on certain nights can t be beat  5  Food is great   In all  I enjoy patronizing this small  Austin-original  family-owned establishment.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,86,To-Go Orders  hidden cost for different meats i.e. fajita meat on torta. My bill totaled an extra  7.00 more than I expected to pay. I was not told about extra cost on the phone when I ordered.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,87,To give you a idea how bad the service was here  they played the same song on repeat for the entire 40 minutes we were in there. The two teenage waitresses just sit in the back on their phones and giggle instead of taking care of their tables. The food was alright actually but the service was so bad Ill never be back.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,88,I ve been coming here for the past fours years  love their breakfast tacos  Great prices for their lunch specials.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,89,Our cast and crew had their breakfast tacos on set. Everybody loved them  So good  I need to go for dinner some time.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,90,They told me a price and then changed it cause they forgot to add something on there. Good business is honoring the price even if you messed up. They take a long time to get the food out. Not happy with the new staff. Wish the old crew was still here
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,91,I have been going to this restaurant since it opened.  Today was the last time.  The food started out good when they first opened. That lasted about a year.  The food and service have continually gone down hill.  I think the family members who were running it  have stepped out of the quality control end of the business.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,92,Had the Chicken Relleno. Sauce was ok as I got the pablano sauce. What disappointed me the mist was that the retried beams were canned  The rice was just cooled in the left over juice from the canned tomatoes that went into the table hot sauce. I even asked the waitress what was good. I will not be back.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,93,Great service  fab food and a clean restaurant  Would ve given 5 stars but they do not make their own tortillas.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,94,I live nearby so the boyfriend and I decided to try this place out for dinner the other day. When we walked in I was hit with the smell of fish and ammonia. I should have known then that things would not end well. The carne asada was stringy and didn t have any flavor to speak of and the beans and rice were okay. Not the worst Mexican food I ve had but I ve definitely had better. Next time I walk into a restaurant reeking of cleaning supplies I ll turn around and find someplace else.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,95,I have mixed reviews.  I have been here about 4 times and I have enjoyed everything I have gotten here.  The salsa I love and to me  that is what makes a great Mexican joint.  And the fact that they offer the traditional things like tortas  menudo  caldo  etc..  My husband likes this place too  but he didn t like what he got last time which was the seafood enchiladas.  But he has enjoyed everything else.  I wish there soft tacos and or breakfast tacos were a little larger.  The size of the flour tortilla is about the size of a corn tortilla you normally see everywhere.  I have always registered in my brain that flour tortillas should be larger than corn  maybe I m wrong  but the majority of places I have gone  it is that way.  But it s still worth going bc that damn salsa is awesome.  My experience last time was awful bc of the service.  I had gone and misread the small board of specials they put by the cash register.  I thought I read happy hour was going on  which is a safe assumption since it was 5 pm.  I asked the waitress just to confirm if they did have their 1 2 price apps going on and she said yes.  Then I always ask this at places just in case one place does say yes  Is your appetizer sampler a part of the happy hour   she said no  which is why I declined it and got three different appetizers instead.  Needless to say  when I got my check  everything was full price  so they were getting busy and I asked the manager on duty who was free.  He said he didn t think 1 2 price apps was on right now and read the board a few times. after that he showed me the board and he was right  it states it is only on the weekends and we were there on a Friday.  I told him I understood but I specifically asked my waitress and she said it was on.  I don t know about you but that needs to be honored regardless and the business take cares of it or its taken out of the waitress  pay for her mistakes.  that s just good business practice.    the manager decided to bring the waitress over and she said she never said that.  My jaw dropped  bc that insinuates she is calling me a lair.  I started to repeat the whole conversation I had with her about asking about the sampler and it was the main reason I decided to order individual apps.  then she apologized and said she wasn t really listening when were asking her questions regarding happy hour.  I was too furious.  the manager then went on to tell me that even if it was HH it only applies to dishes 6.95 and under  then I had to explain to him that all my apps met that and he was reading a main platter price I got.  after he finally realized that I was right  he called the owners.  I never realized managers don t have the authority to do a price correct.  the owners said they will not change the prices  which also makes no sense  I am sure the manager didn t side w  me at all as he explained it to them over the phone.  needless to say I was so unhappy this trip.  I paid and left no tip  the waitress deserved less that what I gave her.  In the end  regardless of that horrendous experience  I do love their food  its good.  I haven t been back to sit and eat bc I am sure they recognize me  but I do get take out.  I don t get much except for their chips  salsa  tacos  regular and breakfast   and tortas.  Don t get the queso  it s not good  though you get a lot for the price.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,96,I came in the evening and ordered food to go. When asking about the menu- it was my first time here- the hostess kept making rude faces.  When the food came it was thrown down on the table. And my order was wrong   I will not be back.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,97,We go here ALL the time for lunch    They have a fabulous lunch menu at an unbeatable price    Free delicious iced tea to boot      Oh  and their chips with salsa are some of the best tortilla chips I ve had anywhere in Austin   
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,98,This small family -run mexican cafe is hidden behind a Hollywood video in a strip mall on william cannon. It s worth seeking out for the reasonably priced breakfasts and lunch specials. It s a clean bright room   good for reading the paper in the morning  with tables and booths. The service is friendly. I ve enjoyed the breakfast quesadilla they call  The Boss - scrambled eggs  cheese and bacon 3.99 . The eggs are cooked to order and are not overdone so it tastes really frsh and yummy. Breakfast tacos are  3   2.99. Migas  4.99 were very spicy with lots of fresh jalapeno- but alas they weren t Trudy s  sigh .  The lunch specials are 4.99 including iced tea and include about 5 0r 6 options. The chicken enchiladas were good and it seems to be a popular place   lunch. I  ve also had the Pozole  available only on week-ends - it was OK. Kind of greasy and not much meat or hominy- but it had good flavor and was served in a huge bowl with chopped onions and cilantro for 5.49. It warmed me up real good on a cold day. The table salsa is good- and garlic-y. and comes when you arrive. It is sometimes more picante than others. The food here is good- not great but it s a pleasant low cost place for breakfast and lunch. I ve never been for dinner but I believe they have beer and wine. And the plates are all very reasonable priced mostly in the  7-  8 range. My pet peeve is that they do not give you a check. You have to go to the register and they give you a verbal total. Seems like they could get better tips if you knew what the total was before you left the table.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,99,Monday breakfast taco special is always on point. The breakfast burrito is the size of a 7 year old s arm. Really wish that I didn t have to ask for chips and salsa.......but I got over that quickly.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,100,I really wanted to like.  Close to home and perfect for Sunday after church.  The tortillas and chips did not appear to be homemade.  Queso served cold and was bland.  Service was slow and inattentive.  Not a terrible place just not any place I will plan to return.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,101,Went for lunch  it was okay.  Not sure I would make the time to go back....
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,102,Observing an underdressed cook wearing shorts and flip flops go from the restroom straight to putting plates in the window made me a little more than nauseous.  I know he was in there for awhile if you know what I mean since I had to wait so long.  There is no possible way he could have washed his hands and clearly not wearing appropriate food handling attire.   Simply disgusting...
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,103,A decent little mexican place in southwest Austin. It s a simple dive with good food and cheap prices - I go either for the taco or enchilada plate...
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,104,This place had some great  breakfast tacos  I will be back  Looks like good hh spot too  good prices overall
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,105,Having tried so many Mexican restaurants in Austin you start to get really picky. Especially considering there s practically one on every block. La Familia is in a strip mall and if you drove by it and blinked you d miss it. Hands down one of the best Mexican joints around. Small  simple  great food  really cheap  decent service  bomb chips and salsa. I pretty much order the same thing here every time  al pastor with beans  rice and tortillas  less than 7 bucks  amazing  Best part is you don t feel like you re 8 months pregnant once eating here as you usually do with Mexican food.  If you re looking for fine dining  tex mex  or having a big dinner party  this probably isn t the place. If you don t feel like cooking one night and want a satisfying meal at a great price  La Familia is the spot.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,106,La Familia accommodates our weekly property tour meetings with prepared seating and a great breakfast.  We have 10 to 12 real estate agents and most are impressed with this little tex-mex gem.  Great service and great food.  Keep up the good work   Heavenly Care Moving thanks you 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,107,The best green sauce enchiladas ever    Lunch price is insane and the portions are even better. Aguas frescas is delicious. Never a wait time which is great cause I hate people. Service is fast and cheap beers as well. I would rent the small storage closet they have to wake up in paradise but my wife probably wouldn t go for it..oh well I guess I can drive the long 2 blocks it is from our apt....go try green sauce enchiladas now   
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,108,This has been a regular stop for my family since it opened a few years ago.  I think the first time we went was during their first week of business.   We have probably eaten here once a month on average for the last four years.  The staff is very friendly  and we have consistently gotten really good service.  The food is not fancy  but consistently good.  For breakfast I strongly recommend the migas plate  IMHO some the best migas in town   and for lunch or dinner try the Flautas  not greasy like most places .
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,109,My husband and I love this place.  The price is great  the food is authentic and really tasty and the staff is nice.  It s a small place and the parking is bad right in front  but better parking is just around the corner with a very short walk.  Great value  great food  especially breakfast  where you can get 3 huge tacos on Monday for  1.99.  WHAT  Yes  I said  1.99  more than 2 ingredients is extra.   Go try it.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,110,We just love this little family-run mexican restaurant. The owners are always there with their kids. They are so family-friendly and nice to our kids too. The food is good and so inexpensive for what you get  The margaritas are very strong  though not as flavorful as they can be. One margarita is enough  This is a great little find if you want good food with a family  simple atmosphere and to support real local Austin business owners.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,111,This is a great place for mexican food. Their salsa is addicting  and their lunch specials are unbeatable.  While not really visible from William Cannon  it is easy to miss but definitely worth looking for and a place to look forward to as well
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,112,I love this place. One of my benchmarks to measure good tex mex is the salsa. And it s very fresh and good. They will sell you some if you ask. Really good boracho beans.  They have the best  5 lunch in town and do a decent mole. Someone mentioned that this is so-so and to go to Maudie s for  good  tex mex. I think Maudie s is about as so-so as it gets. Generally pretty lame actually. And if you go on a weekend night  you get the privilege of waiting an hour for mediocre food and service. This place is easy to get into anytime  have good specials  is very affordable and damn good. The people who work here are very pleasant too. I d give it five stars but I think VIVO is the best tex mex in town. They get my five star vote.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,113,La Familia  well of course  cause this food is what my mama would have made for the family if she was Mexican.  It is just good old home cooking via Mexico.  I had probably the best Chile Rellenos I have ever had.  HERE   yup.  The night we were there it was quiet and the staff was very attentive  friendly and efficient.  I will go back when I want an inexpensive  plenty to eat  after work dinner.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,114,Family owned and operated.  Fast  friendly  delicious and CHEAP     This is the _only_ breakfast taco supplier I trust.  When I started going here several years ago they offered  3 -2 topping tacos for  2 before 11am. Now it is  3  for  3. Where else are you going to find such great value  I no longer dig on swine but while I did  they made _the best_ chorizo in town.  La Familia is all the way across town from me and I regularly make the trek to this hidden gem never giving a second thought to the 20 other Mexican food joints I pass along the way.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,115,for those that frequent this restaurant it is a great place but during certain times. i frequent the establishment 3-4 times a week and have had great service  food and drink. i will never though go in on weekends as service  time to get food if you get it and margarita not up to par as during week. do not know why weekend are any different. have introduced so many of my friends to this restaurant. will definitely advise them not to go on weekends.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,116,Lea and I discovered this caf style restaurant while on another mission  and decided to give it a try. It is on the west side of William Canon north of the Walgreens Pharmacy on Brodie  and is located in one of those single story strip malls. When we entered the restaurant  the fragrances were delightful. I could hear something frying in the kitchen in the back  and there were a few couples already seated and eating traditional Tex-Mex dishes. I ordered their lunch special  three pork tamales in a chili sauce for  5.99. It came with refried beans and Mexican rice. Lea had their taco lunch special for about the same price. Of course  chips and salsa were provided  and we added a chili con queso dip. All flavors were fairly bland compared to La Posada dishes  but would be great for those who don t like spicy. Our soft drinks were  1.75 each  making our lunch total  19.97 without tip. The service was good  and the dishes were nicely prepared  and  knowing that the spiciness is mild  you can kick it up a notch with the three hot sauces provided at the table.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,117,i m really surprised at the so-so comments for this restaurant. i ve only been a couple of times  but i think it s better than most mexican restaurants in southwest austin. it s NOT tex-mex. it s straight up mexican food. their flautas are pretty darn good as is their salsa.  i intend to continue my support of this place.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,118,horrible service    i just waited 25 min  without being checked on  for 3 of the most pathetic looking tacos ever  Plus  when ordering the  waitress  actually corrected my pronunciation AND gave me an ugly look  Sorry if I can t say All my Spanish correctly  but I d never been so horrible as to warrant an ugly look for a real attempt at Spanish.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,119,This place was incredibly disappointing. Driving past last Friday night my hubby and I noticed it was pretty busy so we decided to stop in for a quick bit of dinner. We sat ourselves and were greeted promptly by the server. We perused the menu and couldn t really find anything that stood out so I decided to go with a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and the Pollo Rico  marinated chicken and a chicken enchilada with tomatillo sauce . The soup was definitely tasty but it came out luke warm at best. After finishing up the soup our plates were cleared and our main course had arrived. The chicken appeared to have been marinated in cilantro and lime  nothing special  and the shredded chicken in the enchilada was completely flavorless. The only decent thing about the plate was the tomatillo sauce which was pretty good. For how busy they were the servers that were on did a great job  too bad the food was no good. Doubt I ll be back.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,120,I ve visited this place before and forgot about it  mostly because it s tucked out of the way and there are so many places to eat.  My dad and sister were visiting and wanted some Mexican food.  And although I live right by Santa Rita Cantina  I have no problem driving a little extra for food that actually tasted good. It was Friday night and I knew Chuy s would be packed. SRC just doesn t cut it unless I m just totally desperate.  But enough about them  let s talk La Familia. It s tucked away and off the beaten path  it s quiet and you can sit right down.  That s 5 stars on a Friday night   I usually don t order beef enchiladas with chili con carne  but something told me to.  I did and my dad did.  I think we both almost licked our plates.  They were delicious and not a plateful of grease.  I don t recall what my sister had  but she and my dad are hard to please.  They both really loved what they ordered.  She lives in Vegas and finding good Tex-Mex out there is difficult.  La Familia got her lip smacking seal of approval.  Now I m hungry for some enchiladas 
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,121,Three breakfast tacos for  2.99 on Mondays... I m here every Monday...and maybe during the weekend to cure my hangover.  And I don t have to get up before 11 to get them  Breakfast is served all day and it s sooo good.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,122,I hate to do this  but after giving this place more than enough chances  it s time to scratch it off the list. My husband and I had high hopes for this restaurant since it is the closest spot for Tex Mex. To be fair  we have only ordered breakfast here so the lunch may be phenomenal--I don t know. I m not willing to find out  though. The first time we tried their breakfast tacos  3 for  1.99--good deal  I started gagging because the bacon was undercooked and tough. I mainly just ate the tortillas. I d also like to note that I asked for crispy bacon. On our second visit  I again requested crispy bacon  but ordered the two-egg plate instead. Half of my plate was refried beans  the other half was stale potatoes and again tough soggy bacon. I had to buy a lollipop at the cashier s stand to get the taste out of my mouththat s pretty bad. The waitress was nice  better than the first time we went  but she forgot my husband s milk and he had to get up and find her since she never came back to check on us. I don t recommend eating here  at least not for breakfast.
Taqueria La Familia Mexican Restaurant,123,Bad ass spot. There s not a better family owned Mexican food restaurant west of 35. The food is delicious  especially the La Familia taco   the service is great and the prices are dirt cheap. Get the enchilada plate with ranchera sauce and a fried egg on top and you can t go wrong.
Native Grocery,1,My fav convenient store in AUSTIN. I go to school nearby and always make it a point to drop in before class. I can count on native to provide me delicious healthy options on the go. Native also provides a variety of snacks catering to every dietary restriction that you can think of. There are also snacky snacks available too if you want to satisfy your sweet tooth as well  If you re in the area and don t feel like succumbing to the food swamps nearby def drop in  You won t be disappointed.
Native Grocery,2,It s been a while since I ve been to a kitchen within one of these market stores. They have a fairly sized menu all things considered but to keep it safe I tried a bowl with gyro as my meet. There were no vegetables as promised on the menu but the food still tasted good so I ll allow it 
Native Grocery,3,surprisingly delicious food prepared fresh at one of the most reasonable prices you ll find anywhere. this place is a gem. it seems they sell all kinds of rare condiments  beverages  wine  beer too. What s cool is that they have a lot of vegetarian options which make for a solid lunch. Mediterranean style  The staff and I had a laugh because someone forgot to open up the little dining area with picnic benches. I had created my own little table and chair with some milk crates outside the back door and was happily  enjoying my meal. It s always fun to have an authentic chuckle with people that are working somewhere. I will certainly be back when I m over this way.
Native Grocery,4,I work nearby and visit Native Grocery several times a week. They have a decent selection of food  snacks  drinks  etc. and the staff are generally helpful. Main downside is that their prices on grocery items seem a bit high but the location is very convenient.
Native Grocery,5,I love this place. It s super convenient and chill  everyone inside is friendly and helpful  and as mentioned in another review  - the baklava is not to be missed. I m so glad to have this place in the neighborhood 
Native Grocery,6,Great selection of basically anything you need or want  and always getting more variety. You can come here for an onion  seltzer  huge variety of beer wine hard seltzer cbd water  and now  just about any baking or canned good item. The tacos are also delish  and the lunch evening Mediterranean food is also really tasty. Excellent neighborhood spot.
Native Grocery,7,This grocery store  sandwich stop to was a good spot to grab a snack  grab some quick groceries. I lived in the Guthrie apartment complex next door. Native has a good selection of seltzer s and organic snacks  if that s your thing. I grabbed a sandwich one time from here. It was good warm and fresh. Nothing bad to say. Simple stop no frills.
Native Grocery,8,The food is absolutely AMAZING    amp  the owners are super nice. But there is a lady that works there that is rude asf  and Everytime I order she s just so not professional at all. I think she has to be working there because she is family w the owners cause there s no way they interviewed her for the position. She s just rude as hell  one time I saw her get into w this super nice lady that works where I live and I was in shock. She just very... not professional. Other then her being weird and rude this is a GO TO SPOT 
Native Grocery,9,I have three syllables. Bah-kla-vahh   They sell delicioso home made baklava.  I really like their falafel wrap too. and its super close.
Native Grocery,10,This has been my go to local grocer for items that I need quickly. I love the Mediterranean food options they have. One note  ordering through Grubhub has caused numerous errors in my order  so I have switched to calling or placing the order in person. Friendly staff  and great selection for a small community store.
Native Grocery,11,If I could give negative stars I would. First of all we ordered the night before ON their website for pick up at 7 10 as we were going on a road trip. I showed up on time  they said they hadn t started to come back in 20 min. I m annoyed but leave and come back 30 minutes later. They haven t even started our food...they have me wait while they make the tacos which takes 20 minutes. Truly horrible experience especially given we ordered on their website and not through a third party.
Native Grocery,12,Hallelujah my prayers have been answered. I ve wanted a convenience store less than a block away for years now  I almost moved to NYC for the sheer convenience  but Native Grocery swooped in and made my life better.   They have a bit of everything here and it s not overpriced like most small-stock shops. They have a huge beer selection  breakfast tacos in the morning  and all of those  I don t want to make a whole trip to H-E-B  essentials. Never again will I have to awkwardly ask a neighbor to borrow sugar. I m beaming.   I ve had the privilege of meeting a few of the employees  maybe an owner   and they were all so nice and happy to be in the neighborhood. They even offered us free breakfast tacos just because. That s some Texas hospitality.
Native Grocery,13,Great tacos. Great grocery  wine  beer  and ice cream selection. Friendly staff. What else can I say 
Native Grocery,14,Service is amazing and the people working the register are incredibly nice.   Been going here since it opened. Great place for hot food  breakfast tacos and mediterranean  as well as grocery options.
Native Grocery,15,I ordered from here once - the greek plate  I was craving some gyro  and it was just ok. Clearly the prepackaged gyro meat and rice. I can t speak to the tacos - but is reasonably priced just ok greek food.
Native Grocery,16,Best little convenience store in Austin. The staff is SO kind and welcoming. I can t say that I ve ever said that about convenience store staff before. The wine and beer selection is excellent. PLUS they have a great little kitchen serving Mediterranean food  It s delicious  I had the lentil soup and it was to die for
Native Grocery,17,I have the good fortune of living down the street from what some might consider a hidden gem of a convenience store in East Austin. The drink selection is varied  ranging from go-to sodas and teas  all hail  Big Red and Yerba Mate   to craft beer and wine. Native also stocks all sorts of snacks  I  personally  adore the chip selection here . You ll find the same goods you d grab at Royal Blue but more.  Also  the tacos  They are delicious  with homemade tortillas and fresh ingredients. But aside from the groceries offered  Native also rocks an amazing staff. I hope once the condos near there open  and the construction on Tillery stops  Native starts earning the recognition it deserves. In the meantime  stop by--and stop by often to support this delicious business.
Native Grocery,18,Anyone who doesn t like the tacos here are probably the same people who think Tacodeli is the best taco place in Austin. These tacos are delicious and authentic. And the tortillas are homemade which is surprisingly hard to find in Austin nowadays.  The staff is really nice and the store has a great selection of snacks and beer. They have an impressive wine selection to if you forgot some for wine night. They also have Halo Top  We love walking here since it s so close to our house. My only request is that they get some canned Big Red  But other than that I love coming here.
Native Grocery,19,Delicious tacos  We get our office breakfast tacos here every week and we re in love  The tortillas are so fresh and the avocado salsa is to die for  and no  it doesn t cost extra    Hands down some of the friendliest employees owners. Love supporting this awesome local business 
Native Grocery,20,So great having this in our neighborhood  I m there just about every day and I can t say enough about their level of customer service and the friendly environment they create.  Great food coming out of the kitchen and great selection on beer and wine. Hope to be visiting for many years to come.
Native Grocery,21,I don t want to get the secret out  so I m hesitant to leave this review...but here it is.   These breakfast tacos are insane. In my 8 year trek to find the best breakfast taco in Austin  it s my opinion that these are the winner.   The make them fresh in the back. Unforgettable homemade tortillas. Myriad of ingredients. The way everything is melded together is magical. Amazing salsas  can be spicy  . And they re inexpensive to boot.   The store is kinda randomly located over on Tillery St. on the Eastside. The store is clean  well organized  has friendly staff  and a great drink selection.   It s next to the most excellent East Austin Succulents  so you can grab tacos and then check out cool plants. Great way to nurse a hangover.   I hope this doesn t contribute to a line for my breakfast taco pursuits  but I think these tacos need to be enjoyed by the people of Austin more than anything. You re welcome.
Native Grocery,22,This place is a hidden gem. They offer tacos with homemade flour and corn tortillas.  6 types of salsas you can pour yourself. They just started offering Mediterranean food. I tried the gyro with hummus and their falafel. The prices are moderate too. Truly a great place
Native Grocery,23,This place is the reason I will never move out of this neighborhood. The nicest staff ever  I look forward to seeing them every time I come in. And they are so responsive  I mentioned that I wish they carried dog treats and the next week  they had a huge dog treat selection   Their wine selection is spectacular too. I never have to travel far to buy quality wine. Their tacos are great too since they make their tortillas in house.  Overall  just an awesome little bodega.
Native Grocery,24,Just had a gyro and fries. Fries were solid and had good seasoning. Gyro sandwich was really tasty  good meat and crispy lettuce and a good tomato and it stayed together in the pita even after bringing it home in a to go box. This place is legit they have good breakfast tacos as well and a real solid selection of snacks and good beer. Employees  especially Maria  are real nice as well
Native Grocery,25,We live just down the street and honestly i am struggling to find the words to describe the level of customer service that the entire staff provides. They always  without fail  greet you as you walk in and make sure to ask how your day is going. In addition to the spectacular service they have the best breakfast tacos in town and recently added a Mediterranean menu which is to die for. If you live in the area or are visiting the area make sure you stop in  you will not regret it 
Native Grocery,26,The best home made Tortilla ..made when you order your taco.   A choice of floor  corn  whole wheat floor  and another store secret fluffy floor Tortilla.   They have a vegetarian taco options as well.    Lunch tacos are great with different fresh cooked meat options -- the beef fajita was awesome   The Store has a great selection of wines and so many doors of craft and local beer.    Welcome to our neighbor hood ... such a great store to have by a walking disctance to our home
Native Grocery,27,What a cute  unique little gem. An incredible wine selection  but also an awesome selection of refrigerated hipster-esque cold brews - not only Stumptown and High Brew  but a bunch of other brands I d never even heard of before- can t wait to go back and stock up  This place also has a really hand-picked  high-quality  if not limited   locally-sourced selection of household products  snacks  candy  frozen meals  etc... It s like the 7-11 for hipster millennium oenophiles. But in the best way possible. I noticed they tote local brand  which was a cool way of discovering some new companies. And don t forget the real reason to come- the amazing breakfast tacos being made in the back.
Native Grocery,28,Im a regular here  I come in at least 2-4 times a week right after work to grab my usual munchies  my job is next to a convenient store but i stop here bc of the staff  if you listen to the people coming in  you can tell its the same story  they really need a raise bc i guarantee you not as many people would go in if it wasn t the same staff  they are always keeping up with it   cleaning ect.   breakfast is made with pride by the very nice ladys in the morning  lunch is not the  best  but is good  This place has also saved me some time from going to heb. Awesome people and environment.
Native Grocery,29,Awesome breakfast tacos made with homemade tortillas. Staff is super nice and helpful. Great neighborhood spot
Native Grocery,30,The nicest staff and selection of beer and wine  Also the most crave worthy tacos with green salsa ever    I visit this place daily.
Native Grocery,31,Hands down the best tortillas  tacos in town.   They re affordable  the tortillas are rolled out by hand the way your grandma used to do it  and they re made fresh to order by lovely women who take pride in the food they are making for you. There s also more than one salsa option  which seems to be a thing unheard of by some other options in the neighborhood  and the beans are vegetarian.   Bonus  it s also a convenience store and it s connected to tillery plant co 
Native Grocery,32,Good selection of beer but the tacos were disappointing. I went in several times to try their tacos  and each time it got worse. The meats are dry and have no flavor.
Native Grocery,33,Staff didn t want to be helpful when I asked about my food allergy  and the person that did answer just gave an excuse so she could hang up the phone. Food looks good but steer clear if you have  any food allergies.
Native Grocery,34,My favorite place to get breakfast and lunch tacos made on homemade flour wheat or corn tortillas. Got to try them
Native Grocery,35,Yum  I get tacos here every Friday. It s nice to have something near Tillery that isn t super expensive and very good. The owners are so nice and the quality never changes. The avocado salsa rivals any other salsa in Austin.
Native Grocery,36,Homemade tortillas and top notch food  a must looks like is just a store but the treasure awaits
Native Grocery,37,So excited to have such an awesome connivence store next door. Perfect addition to the neighborhood. Awesome selection of drinks and healthy snacks    employees are great 
Toyloco,1,Excellent tacos. I had al pastor  campesano  and vampiro. These are my favorite places to eat at. Price is right and service is top notch.
Toyloco,2,Ordered via doordash on a Friday night. A friend and I got the 6 pack of mini tacos  pastor style. We also ordered two vampiro tacos with steak.   The mini tacos were delicious. They gave us two sauces  a green  spicy   and a red. I loved the red sauce  Unfortunately  instead of giving us the two vampiro tacos  they have us two MORE orders of the mini tacos with steak. Bummed I didnt get to try that taco  but I cant be mad about 12 mini tacos lol. The steak version was just as good as the pastor    Everything was hot and packaged well  would definitely order again 
Toyloco,3,Taco trucks on the East side generally tend to be good and Toyloco is pretty decent. They got all the meats and the meats are very flavorful  regardless of which you pick. My personal favorites are probably the al pastor and the grilled fish. Both of them are moist and your prototypical renditions of the classics. Your tacos also come with red or green salsa and all of them pack a wallop of heat so be warned. The mini tacos also come with some cucumber and limes  which is a refreshing cooling tool. It s a good balance of fresh  acidity and flavorful fatty meat.   That said  what I can t get past is the corn tortillas they used. Mine tasted almost stale  like the really cheap ones from the supermarket that tend to give corn tortillas a bad rep. I like corn tortillas generally but like the case of sushi where the rice base is just as important  if not more important to the dish  tortillas need to be good to go with the meat. Maybe my order was an abberation  but at least for now that s what holds Toyloco back.
Toyloco,4,Consistently the absolute best tacos ever. My go to s are the al pastor and the steak  both of which taste as if the meats are marinated and served inside beautiful corn tortillas.  And best of all  they are super cheap compared to similar places.
Toyloco,5,Delicious little food truck in East Austin  Really enjoyed my first visit and definitely plan to visit to try a few more tacos or gorditas. They ve got several tables for seating and plenty of great options to choose from on a Thursday evening.  We ordered several of the tacos  asada  carnitas  al pastor  etc. each around  2- 3 . Highly recommend the salsa verde- it pairs well on all their options 
Toyloco,6,Eh... It gets the job done. If you re craving tacos as obsessively as I do  then they serve tacos. I m not sure if I got the last batch of meat for the day  but it was not fresh and I wasn t very satisfied. The price is right  but I don t know if I will return.
Toyloco,7,One of those late night discoveries after day drinking.  The tacos here are amazing   I got the steak  fish tacos and a gringa while my friend got 3 steak tacos.  We also got chips with salsa and guacamole.  The tacos are pretty small but it s only  3 and full of flavor.  I thought the fish tacos was amazing .  I ll definitely have to come back and get one of each flavor next time.
Toyloco,8,This place popped up on Uber Eats so I decided to give it a go. Ordered a shrimp burrito and a shrimp taco.  Shrimp Burrito - I know burritos are dead to Austin  but I ve had some delicious burritos in my time here  and this burrito is no exception. The shrimp was legit sized and well-grilled  and the burrito was packed with everything you want in a burrito  guac included  . Not as big as a burrito you d get from some of those fast places like Chipotle or Freebirds  but definitely better tasting.  Shrimp Taco - shrimp taco was also delicious  came on a doubled corn tortilla with pretty standard shrimp taco toppings  queso fresco  red cabbage  etc. . Overall quite tasty.  Salsas - word of warning  the roasted red salsa is HOTTER than the creamy green salsa verde. This goes against all Austin taco conventions  where the creamy green looking salsa is always the spiciest. However  the flavor of both salsas was amazing  as I found myself switching back and forth between them. The burrito and taco held up without the salsas  but I enjoyed the nice kick every couple of bites.  Next time I need to take some pics. Take my word for it and try them out 
Toyloco,9,Just ordered via DoorDash - phenomenal. Hard to find a good burrito in Austin  especially being from CA  but this hit the spot. Two shrimp tacos  chefs kiss  will definitely be coming back here... tomorrow
Toyloco,10,Move over  Veracruz. The people have spoken and there s a new mayor in Taco Town.  From the good ol  days of Torchy s and Tacodeli to crowd favorites Pueblo Viejo and Discada  there is a taco stand on virtually every corner of this city. Personally  I would never have the courage to open up a taco truck and brave the fierce competition. Lucky for us  Toyloco was up for the challenge.  Their tacos aren t quite your typical cebolla-cilantro street tacos or your over-the-top queso-on-fried-chicken gringo tacos  but a perfect middle ground. Did you know you could put a fried egg in a taco  I didn t. To me  Toyloco s tacos are authentic tacos  enhanced and perfected. Some pickled red onions here  some queso fresco there   an avocado or two  and BOOM  you have yourself heaven on a tortilla.  And did I mention that these are the best tortillas in town  Crispy but not crunchy. Light yet scrumptious. As round as they are delicious. A thing of beauty if you ask me.  And the PRICE IS RIGHT. Nothing on the menu over  4  most hover a little under  3. Now  it is important to note that these tacos are slightly smaller than what you may be used to  so I recommend getting three  four if you re starving . So you re still walking away with a meal in the  10 range. I ll take it.  Also  they re very quick on your order. I love me some Veracruz and Pueblo Viejo  but those 30-45 min wait times are killer. If you re hungry and can t deal with a wait  this place is a no-brainer.  In conclusion  did I just discover this place three weeks ago  Yes. Have I been five times since  No comment.  I recommend the taco favorito  the loco taco  fish  and shrimp.
Toyloco,11,Place can be absolutely fire  if they get the order right.  Would recommend ordering in person. They just can t seem to ever get our order right  and this is from over 20 different times ordering a DoorDash.  Again  some of the best street tacos in Austin  but can be a huge bummer when they just flat out don t read the order ticket correctly. To consistently forget things is either a bagger issue or a language barrier. If you ask for extra anything  I promise you aren t getting it.
Toyloco,12,Food was delicious and it hit the spot.  Reviews are not incorrect  food is fresh and tasty.  Orders taco combo took food to go.  As soon as we got in the car it smelled delicious.  Ordered mini taco combo it was delicious wished I would of ordered regular size tacos.  Will definitely go back and try other things.  Only thing I wished that this place offered was orchata water to go with the food.  Overall this place was yummy   Sorry no pictures tacos smelled so good that completely forgot.
Toyloco,13,Not impressed with their quesadilla. It was greasy and limp with hardly any cheese. The beef and bell peppers I requested to add were fine. The sour cream served on the side was nearly liquid. I ll trust the other reviews that they make good tacos  but quesadillas aren t their thing.
Toyloco,14,Awesome place  Love the whole menu at this place  but the California burrito is my favorite.
Toyloco,15,Ordered the Pastor tacos and they are said to come with pineapple and lime  instead I got them with cucumbers and lemon    Also got a steak burrito and pretty sure it was all lettuce and sour cream because I never got a bite of steak.
Toyloco,16,Amazing place   So delicious  I got the carnitas tacos and they hit the spot. The chips  guac  amp  salsa were amazing too 
Toyloco,17,AMAZIIIIIING TACOS  specially the shrimp ones  and great customer service... I one thousand recommend 
Toyloco,18,Tasty tacos. Portions were smaller than we are used to but food was very flavorful. We ordered al pastor and bistek tacos. Great ingredients. Love that tortilla was lightly fried.
Toyloco,19,Excellent street tacos and still affordable. I had the camaron and pastor tacos and they both had great flavor. The pastor also had pickled cucumber on the side to add and it was perf. Will be back to try breakfast tacos 
Toyloco,20,This place is delicious  I really enjoyed the mini tacos    The gentleman  amp  lady were really nice  they always make sure to add salsas or whatever you may need   I really recommend this place
Toyloco,21,Every time I have been to this place the experience has been magical. Incredibly well executed tacos  solid salsa  and a charming owner make this a severely underrated dining experience. Tacos are but an expression of our humanity  and this humble taco joint channels a sublime encapsulation of what makes human beings a positive part of the universe.   Recommended dishes  pastor tacos  shrimp tacos  the best in town   vampiro tacos.
Toyloco,22,New taco joint with legit  finger-licking Mexico City style tacos  I m from there  Chilanga from head to toe  so I can tell you . I had six mini pastor tacos for  7. The tortillas were clearly homemade  delicious  and didn t break at all. As tradition  the pastor was topped with fresh pineapple  cilantro and raw onion. The onions were toasted just slightly to reduce the bite. His homemade red salsa was the most perfect finishing touch. Make sure to ask for it    Not only is the food delicious  but it is served by the owner and chef. His name is Jose  and he is incredibly attentive and kind. Make sure to say hi.  I will definitely make this my new regular taco spot. Gracias Jose por traerme un cachito de casa a Austin.
Toyloco,23,Here for the 2nd time this week  I cannot stress enough how delicious the burrito is. Get it with steak fajita. It s not a giant Chipotle mess. This is El Paso border burrito wonderfulness. The shrimp taco is packed with flavor  Chips guacamole and salsa are order-worthy - perfect red restaurant salsa. The taco sauces  red and green  and HOT. Family inhaled the al pastor tacos. Don t forget an agua Fresca   
Toyloco,24,This place is pretty amazing  the guy makes fresh meat tacos. The Al Pastor have a very distinct and delicious flavor. I enjoy the way they serve your food in the basket with pickled onions  fresh radishes and cucumbers.
Toyloco,25,Not a very welcoming vibe. Kinda rude  like I was doing them a favor by eating there. And they were out of ingredients. Weird  considering there s an H E B next door. Too many tacos places in this city. Will not be back
Toyloco,26,I am so excited to discover this incredible stand that s open late too. When I arrived  Jose patiently listened as I explained my wheat allergy and then he made gluten-free beef tacos that rocked my world. No alergic reaction - and I m quite sensitive.  The red salsa he makes himself was the perfect spicy touch. I especially like his choice of sweet onions slightly grilled to bump the sweet up a bit. Of course  cilantro and all the fix ns too.  Go taco bout it 
Toyloco,27,Bomb little taco spot  Just went the other day got the 6 mini steak tacos  and a el pastor  Bomb we good will definitely come back 
Toyloco,28,My favorite spot for tacos in Austin. Definitely a hidden gem. The carnitas are the best  but you can t go wrong. Also the salsas are delicious. Toyloco has to be on your list of go to tacos
Toyloco,29,Great late night tacos if you re in the area. Bistec taco is awesome  only wish they were open Sundays and more regular daytime hours.
Toyloco,30,Really amazing. I had two of the al pastor tacos on corn tortillas. Best al pastor tacos I ve had  maybe ever 
Toyloco,31,Wow  was super surprised by this place  I got a shrimp taco with a side of chips and salsa. The food was super authentic. The pricing was also super reasonable cheap. Hands down the best shrimp tacos that I ve had state side. Definitely recommend going to support this local business.
Toyloco,32,This place is really good. It looks like a run of the mill Mexican food truck on the side of the road but don t be deceived by its plain looks. It s got a high level of attention to detail. Like a special spicy sauce for fish tacos and tasty green and red salsas. The owner is friendly and speaks English.
Toyloco,33,Delicious menu of authentic Mexican standards. Street tacos  tortas  sop s   amp  gorditas. I had tacos al pastor on corn tortillas and a steak vampiro. The tacos al pastor are quintessential tacos al pastor. The steak vampiro is two corn tortillas with griddled Oaxacan type cheese beneath a layer of streak and pico. So damn tasty. Check this spot out  it s super reasonable for the fresh  quality food. Plus ample parking in the back.
Taquero Mucho,1,Ended up scrambling for food near the Domain at prime dinner time. I know Taquero Mucho downtown is always packed  but the Burnett location was fast to seat us down. There were some other big tables  but not completely occupied.   We started with the choriqueso  which was delicious. It had different salsas in it and came with some red tortillas and chips. Along w the choriqueso  we had some margaritas and Negra Modelo on draft  tastes even better on draft.   Our main entrees were the shrimp tacos and the torta cubana. Shrimp tacos were fresh and yummy  and came w some beans and rice. The torta was so big  I ate one half for dinner and the other half for lunch the next day  served with French fries  that were also abundant.   Service is always great  downtown or Burnett  so even if it s packed  you could be seated pretty quickly.
Taquero Mucho,2,My husband and I came here for brunch a few weeks ago. I got the anti-bitch juice  amazing  highly recommend  and the birria tacos. My husband got some other tacos  can t remember the name  and he did not like them. He ended up eating most of my tacos and wished he had ordered that.   I deducted two stars because I  personally  don t believe there was a need for a DJ at 11 30 am on a Saturday. We were barely able to hear each other.   Overall  a super cute restaurant for pink-lovers and probably better for happy hour with the girls.
Taquero Mucho,3,You basically pay for the aesthetics your looking for in these restaurants food was way over priced for what they serve and not much I can say   Other than the food  place is super cute staff is sweet and very professional super clean environment 
Taquero Mucho,4,Loved this restaurant. We were celebrating a friends baby shower and it was simply the best location. It is right by the Domain and it has lots of seats. The decor is really cute and perfect for the pictures. I am gluten and dairy free and the server told me that they are mainly a gluten free restaurant  but they do have flour tortillas. It is something huge for me    I ordered the chicken tacos which were really good and it was a very big serving. The chicken was tender  but it had a good char. Perfect combination  IMHO. I didn t feel it was greasy or heavy at all. Delicious 
Taquero Mucho,5,Such a cute Instagram restaurant  They know what they are doing here. Not only is the whole place is cute. The food is actually really good too  the presentation was on point as well. Even the paper the tortilla chips came on were so cute. We enjoyed each part of our visit. We definitely recommend it as a must go to place 
Taquero Mucho,6,What a FUN lunch experience we had at this pink very pink restaurant now in a north Austin location   We had tried several times to get to the downtown one unsuccessfully so we re happy to find this one right off Burnet   New vibe   lots of pink  and GREAT FOOD what s not to love   We arrived for a late lunch so the place was very empty  wow  so we had a chance to really enjoy the vibe and the decor  all that pink    The music was very upbeat and when we looked at the food near us it all had fun interesting pink purple details incorporated in fun creative waysLoved it  Down to the drinks  I got the frozen rose known as the anti bitch juice  and the special fried taquitos  Tacos Dorados  that were oh soooo good   My daughter got the Adobada Sope that she said was delish . Portion size was delectable. We also shared a choco-flan desert that for me was too sweet but my daughter  who has a sweet tooth  said was just right. We then took all the pictures  There s a special swing with wings set inside the small alcove to the left  as you come in  so don t miss it  Enjoy your stay here and have fun with all the special details they have set up for their customers  
Taquero Mucho,7,Loved this place. Was in town for a bachelorette party and I m so happy we stopped. Great food  great alcohol  and great service  A little bit of a wait but that s to be expected on a Friday night with a big group. I loved the theme and how everything was pink. I wish I could come here all the time 
Taquero Mucho,8,This Taquero Mucho location is so much nicer and convenient that the downtown one. Even though I usually prefer outdoor seating  the fact that there s ample parking and that it s not as crowded made it a winner. Food was legit. I m a fan of sopes and their arrachera beef is super flavorful. Their beans are probably the best compared to any other Tex Mex place in Austin. The frozen mango margarita was quite strong and only  6 cause of happy hour. Overall  good meal and a nice option to finish off your week.
Taquero Mucho,9,An all pink restaurant  Count me in.  I haven t had a chance to visit the downtown location  but when this one opened I told myself it was time I went by. First  if you have to wait an absurd time to get a table  like my group who had to wait an hour and a half   there is a dive-y bar a door down. They weren t taking reservations ahead of time when I went.  So the inside is super cool. It truly is all pink with plenty of photo opps. Definitely fun for the vibes and drinks with a group of friends. What didn t work for me was the food. It s very similar in taste to their sister restaurant Gabriela s and maybe just not my type of Mexican food. I definitly want to go back and try more of the dishes cause alot of things look good. Maybe I ll go by the downtown location next and love it more 
Taquero Mucho,10,Cute decor for photo ops  and that s why I wanted to go. I expected to see more  but it wasn t too bad. Service was good and our waiter attentive and nice. The food was tasty. We had La Hamona Burger   it comes in a box   chicken quesadilla  my daughter s friend said she was going to pass out it was so good   Tacos Dorados  which is flautas   and pollo asado avocado  the veggies were so yummy . I had a pink margarita and I was hoping for sweet  but it wasn t. I should ve paid attention to the ingredients. The menu is a QR code at your table. The music was mostly Bad Bunny tonight lol oh we had totopos  chips  with guacamole and the guacamole was good. I was hoping for more seasoning also in the food  but it wasn t terrible. The food is overpriced I believe for what you are getting. The drink I had I didn t think was worth  10  as I ve had yummier margs for less  and not watered down . I paid  83 for all our dishes shown  4 soft drinks and my one marg.
Taquero Mucho,11,The overall experience is fun to do...just once. But I d rather do it without the food. The chicken and waffles were average  almost below . The best part of the plate was the fruit. The choriqueso was average overall. And the drink was eh.   Overall  the service was great and as a marketing nerd  I love how everything was on brand and appreciate the IG style ambiance. But I definitely won t recommend going here if someone is hungry.
Taquero Mucho,12,One of my favorite places to visit when in the domain area  They have a great happy hour with discounted drinks for about  6 and discounted appetizers. The vibe is awesome as well  love the day party feel any time if the week. Music is excellent  an awesome spot for Latin music. Lots of great places to take pictures as well. Very  Instagramable      Just wish it could be a good dancing place  Since moving to Austin  I ve been looking for a good place to dance latin music up north. But last time we went late on a Saturday  it s mostly a sit and drink kind of place. The food has been good  but the drinks definitely win in comparison.
Taquero Mucho,13,TLDR  GGGOOORRRGGGEEEOOOUUUSSS  A friend from Austin recommended Taquero Mucho and I m so glad she did  We didn t get to go to the original but accidentally went to the BRAND NEW ONE           Y all  It s like if all of your eight grade pink dreams became a restaurant  I was in HEAVEN       All pink EVERYTHING       The photo ops are amazing and the food is actually really good as well   If you re in ATX and want the photo ops AND good food go to Taquero Mucho  It s gorgeous  You ll be happy you did   Note for restaurant  I couldn t find hours of operation outside the restaurant. I wasn t sure if y all were open for business. So I swung by early to see and couldn t find them unless I didn t look in the right place.
Taquero Mucho,14,If you re in Austin you need to stop by Taquero Mucho the location on Burnet Road and Kramer Lane. This super cute restaurantsoffers many photo opportunities for a date or a brunch day with your friends. Make sure you get there early on the weekend because it will be busy. The drinks and food was delicious  The Mango Mami had tajin and chamoy and was really refreshing. The consom  and birria tacos were delicious and they came with rice and charro beans.  They also had a DJ on Sunday when I went and they were playing all the jams      Queso Birria Tacos    Mango Mami Margarita  not pictured 
Taquero Mucho,15,Taquero Mucho has been a hot spot in Austin  mostly because everything is pink  And I mean everything. The drinks  the walls  the chairs  the TORTILLAS... it s all pink. It s truly the cutest restaurant I ve been to with so much character. Plus there are plenty of photo spots around Taquero Mucho including a giant pink phone booth.  Aside from the color  the atmosphere is great. I went on a Saturday night and they hosted several birthday bachelorette groups. There was a DJ in the corner so everyone was yelling and dancing  not sure if it s like this during the week   but it was truly a weekend vibe.   Unfortunately  the food was not as great. I was not impressed with the pink margarita and the tacos weren t anything special. The bartender did give me a fros  in place of the margarita  but it wasn t much better. I did see several dishes come out of the kitchen that looked delicious  so I may come back to try one of those  There was also a 2  hour wait at 8pm on a Saturday so we had to sit at the bar which wasn t very comfortable. But super sweet bartenders   Overall  I d recommend anyone try Taquero Mucho at least once for the atmosphere  cmon  it s a pink restaurant . But I would try to come during the week when it s not as busy 
Taquero Mucho,16, Burnet Rd location - free parking in front of restaurant in parking lot   Taquero Mucho has two locations in Austin and everything is pink inside. I read mixed reviews on it where some people said it was cool to see  but the food wasn t great  so I am super glad we didn t listen to those and tried it. It was a great experience from the decor  atmosphere  service  and food. I wish we had one here in TN    If you re ever in Austin check them out 
Taquero Mucho,17,I absolutely LOVE this place  The food  drinks and ambiance was everything AND it was all pink There were a variety of creative drinks and shots. Great photo ops so you ll definitely wanna get cute for this place. I will definitely be coming back the next time I visit Austin. The avocado enchiladas were so flavorful as well as the variety of sauces 10 10 for me  
Taquero Mucho,18,This place is a girls dream  The inside is pink  pink  and more pink. The decor is super fun and lots of cool photo op areas. The drinks are fabulous and the food is good too. I will definitely return next time I am in Texas.
Taquero Mucho,19,Cute place to go. Send quite versatile--I can see women coming here for their Valentine s Date or a woman coming out with her girls when one is going through a breakup.  The place could be cleaner and the side dishes and appetizer tastes better than the entree itself.  Also this place reminds me of T-Mobile due to all of the being pink.  I do like the concept of it though.
Taquero Mucho,20,I was glad to see second location open up  Such a fun atmosphere  It s all things PINK  I went on a Saturday around 1pm and it was a hour wait.  The food wasn t great  very bland and cold    I was disappointed.  They had a live DJ  that was awesome  He was good   The drinks were delicious and strong  I think it s definitely a place you should go at least once    you ll get some good Instagram pictures  
Taquero Mucho,21,Alright y all. The awaited  NEW  Taquero Mucho location review.  A group of us went for brunch on Saturday. We decided to get there when they opened to beat the crowd. NOPE. Line at the door. To be expected. To be honest  we didn t wait long at all but that goes to show how in demand a table here is    We ordered the Choriqueso as an appetizer and it was bomb    THE TORTILLAS ARE PINK. Super filling though and I definitely ate too much of it. I have a bad habit of doing that.  For our main course - I ordered the Chilaquiles and the rest of the girls got the French Toast. Mine was okay. I wasn t crazy about it but I did finish it. I also did not ask for the steak to be added but got it anyway. The French Toast was a sold 9 10 and the portion size was super reasonable.  As for drinks... I ordered a Paloma  10 10 . The Frozen Pink Margarita looked so freaking cute and was told it was good and super strong.   Only things I didn t love  - Parking kind of sucks. All I can say is good luck. - Music is super loud. - No GF options  Otherwise  I will definitely be back and can t wait to explore more of the menu 
Taquero Mucho,22,Food was ok at best. I ordered the chilaquiles  they were good but I wouldn t order them again. Cheesecake Factory makes better chilaquiles which is disappointing to say. Beans were overly peppered. Potatoes lacked salt. There was a long hair in our queso. When we told the waiter they said no one in the back has hair LOL. They eventually took the queso off the bill but knowing we all shared that same hairy queso before finding the hair was unsettling.   Signature drinks were gimmicky and underwhelming.   The environment was strange. The music is so loud you feel like you re in a club. The entire time I had to scream at my friends to have a conversation. The music wasn t bad just way too loud. Whatever you do DO NOT let them seat you near one of there photo op areas. Unless of course you love people standing over you and bumping into you while you eat. If you re really lucky they ll stop you mid bite to ask if you can take their group picture for them. I don t blame the customers for this  the whole idea is to enjoy the various photo op areas. I blame the restaurant for not providing adequate space for guests to enjoy both the scenery and their underwhelming food.   My biggest complaint is the staff. They are obnoxiously rude. Very snappy when asked anything. Expect constant eye rolls and sighs while you order. There was also one point where a staff walked through our group and bumped our bride to be  that we were there celebrating. No excuse me or anything. The weirdest part was we weren t in her way she intentionally walked through our group and bumped us. She then proceeded to death glare at us for literally a min. Maybe it was her hair in the queso 
Taquero Mucho,23,Nothing like a good experience in pink   Thank you Taquero Mucho for an excellent experience and good food. You all where on point.
Taquero Mucho,24,After seeing this restaurant all over Instagram  I was expecting a pretty place. Yes  I was pink and girly and beautiful inside. What I wasn t expecting was to enjoy my food and drinks as much as I did. I m not even an enchilada person and I thought these were phenomenal. The atmosphere is lively and fun inside. It definitely puts you in a good mood. The service was really quick. I love that you can purchase merchandise in here. Some of the food and drinks come with the option to buy souvenirs  like a strawberry cup and heart sunglasses. Overall  it was a fun place we will definitely be revisiting.
Taquero Mucho,25,What a cute  def Instagram  spot to go grab a drink and a bite    Key takeaways  1- come prepared to spend about  50 each a person  if you order a drink . I split a main dish and ordered 2 drinks and spend around 53 with tip. For reference  I ordered the drink that came with sunglasses and it was  20 - ha  2- you come here for the drinks and the pics - nothing more. The food was not very good which i wasn t too disappointed about because typically spots like this don t focus too much on the food quality  3- the wait time for 12pm on a Saturday was 1.5 hours....be prepared to wait even on  off times . We ended up sitting at one of the bars and it was honestly fine since the bar stools were comfy 4- take all the pics your heart desires   That s what you came for anyways
Taquero Mucho,26,Visited this place for the first time while in Austin for lunch. This place was phenomenal    We were seated right away  I absolutely loved all the pink decor  We ordered the Chile con Queso with chorizo  as an appetizer with their chips  Gasp   Amazing   Lick the bowl that queso was so good  I ordered the Avocado Cream Enchiladas and let me tell you they were the best enchiladas I ve ever eaten. The rest of my family had ordered Arranchera Asada  Enchiladas Vegetarianas and Bistek Torta. We all ate as much as we could fit into our bellies. If you re in the area this is a must try 
Taquero Mucho,27,This place is an influencers paradise I swear. My girlfriend and I went here on a Friday after we both finished work. We looked around and I was surprised at the amount of girls that were all dolled up while eating and for good reason. Everyone had their phones out and was taking repeated selfies.   I like the environment and vibe of the restaurant  when we went in there was a DJ so it was nice to sit and listen while drinking in everything that Taquero Mucho had to offer.   We order some queso  chips  and got the salsa sampler. I ordered the avocado cream enchiladas.   Food  The salsa sampler was good  pretty much comes out on a flight board and you get to try the different salsa s.   The queso taste good but got cold and hardened really quickly we had to use the spoon instead of the chips to get anything.   I personally loved my enchilada that I got  I thought that it tasted really good. It came out with rice and beans  the charro came in a cute little heart shaped bowl hence the name of the restaurant.   I would come back on an off time when there isn t that much people around as the downside was my girlfriend really wanted to take a picture at the telephone booth but after waiting 10 minute for the group of girls to leave she gave up.
Taquero Mucho,28,If you want poppin pictures for Instagram  you SHOULD make a trip to Taquero mucho. It is truly lots of fun and full of vibes. My roomie and I came for Galentines day  which is by far the best time to go.   The food was great  however we both only got appetizers from happy hour. The waiter was really attentive and nice.   A really fun experience overall 
Taquero Mucho,29,4 5 for vibes  3 5 for food  3.5 for drinks. This is definitely one of those places meant for Instagram updates but I don t mind it. The pink decor and tortillas were adorable  It was a pretty fun energy but a bit loud. The food was only okay  not worth the price. I went here for my birthday and they give me a free shot which was nice  For drinks  I would definitely go with their anti-bitch juice- cute  sweet  and nice for buzz.
Taquero Mucho,30,I think this spot is more for the vibes Instagram photo ops  but the food was okay decent.   I came here with some friends after our boxing class. We got the chips and queso to start -- the queso was very..thin and tasted artificial. I wasn t too impressed by it at all.   I ordered the chipotle enchiladas -- while not authentically Mexican  I thought the flavor was good. There was exactly one slice of a chopped hot dog in my charro beans which I thought was a little strange..
Taquero Mucho,31,IG Esthetics for sure       Pink every where such a fun photo spot     Location easy to find but good luck with parking there is many other business   -Price  some what high  -Portion sizes fair -taste   rice was meh   beans were fun there was I believe ham n hot dogs in them  loved the HM pink tortillas   carne asada was soft a lot of flavor n so was the chicken really soft  the guacamole was ok nothing really wowed me as far as taste  -Drinks are really good    And fun  -Customer service we had a great experience till it started to get busy and then had to ask for the check a few times  - music was loud n if ur looking to talk it hard to do that once it becomes busier the noise bounces off each other.   In all a fun girls drink n chips Kinda place
Taquero Mucho,32,New location  IG worthy spot for sure  Monday 7pm  party of 4. Only a 15 minute wait  score  I ordered the High Maintenance drink and wowzer  it was good and strong  The salsa sampler was good  just wish the salsa portions were a bit bigger. The purple potato taquitos were meh. The asado tacos were good  but those rice and charro beans were delicioso   Overall  definitely recommend and will for sure be back again 
Taquero Mucho,33,This establishment is owned by the same people who own La Sirena  which is known for their fresh seafood dishes  strong cocktails  and fun music playing in the background. We went for lunch today  and were thoroughly impressed. My shrimp ceviche was fresh and full of flavor  and I brought home leftovers of the generous amount of Chile con queso. Edwyn had the carnitas and raved about them throughout the meal.  And if that wasn t enough  the watermelon margaritas with CBD  the music and staff were absolutely fantastic  which is clearly one of the reasons why there was such a big  diverse group of fellow diners. This is a true gem.
Taquero Mucho,34,Super cute and fun place to take a group of girls that are all about the cute instagram photos. Seriously this place was a VIBE. On top of that  the food was surprisingly delicious. The queso was phenomenal and the chicken and waffles really hit the spot. Added in a side of elote and I was a very happy individual. I was here with a group of teenagers and they loved the overall aesthetic.
Taquero Mucho,35,The drinks are bomb and the food is good  I really enjoyed the High maintenance drink. The packaging is picture perfect and the taste is great. The watermelon taste is just right. A tad sweet but not sickly sweet and just enough sourness. I ordered the carnitas and was impressed.  It had that fall apart texture and the accompanying rice was just as fluffy. Don t forget the beans - love mixing my beans and rice. Some think it s weird there are little hotdogs in the beans but I think it gives it that extra flavoring without being too salty. Service was friendly and the crowd got energetic even during lunch time.
Taquero Mucho,36,So many people and TikToks suggested for me to pay a visit to Taquero Mucho  so I did. As I entered I was warmly greeted and sat a little over 15 minutes later.      Prior to being sat  my friends and I went to the bar to try their drinks. I ordered the  Anti Bitch Juice  and was surprised to the say it was great    When we were sat in our table  we were attended a little over 28 minutes later.  Our server approached us because we flagged a couple of them down  until one of them told our server we were looking for them.    Our server had an attitude and finally took our order. Our food was served a little over 34 minutes later and our drinks were brought to us after the food was served. Mind me  we already had drinks from the bar  if not this review would have been completely different.  Karen Mode   The food was delicious and the drinks we ordered after were fantastic. I would definitely recommend the food and drinks from here  To go  of course .   The theme is all pink and beautiful. Very instagramable.   My suggestions to the business manager owner is to have assigned areas of the restaurant to servers because they seemed to be everywhere and forgetting things the consumer was ordering.   3 Stars guys. It s a shame because I really liked the food and drinks.
Taquero Mucho,37,This place was beyond cute  You know how you go somewhere because Instagram had totally cute photo opportunities then the food or drinks didn t live up to how cute it was. This was not the case  Drinks were 10 10. Food was 10 10. Ambiance 10 10. My favorite was the birria tacos and watermelon margarita  You won t be disappointed.
Taquero Mucho,38,This place is very pink lol it s like walking into a whole new  world. The drinks were good. Can t complain there at all. The chicken wings were bomb. We got lemon pepper and the hot one  Man they was bomb. Definitely got to order a 12 piece when you go there. The chips and dip was good too  Definitely need to grab some of those. The chicken enchiladas were bomb too. Go ahead and explore the menu look like you can t go too wrong there.
Taquero Mucho,39,I would like to say thanks to Instagram I m glad I was able to make it here. I did not know there was one North and thought the only one was downtown. We were able to walk in and even though it was crowded we were able to get a booth quick. We enjoyed margaritas and a virgin one also.  I got the Enchiladas Vegetarianas and it was good. The only downside I wasn t able to 86 the mushrooms. I was told that it is already premixed so I just picked them out. It was a good portion size and filled me up since I didn t have breakfast. My daughter got the La Hamona Burger and when I say it was big it was BIG. She was unable to finish it so she took it home. She has a love for bacon and ham and beef so what she was able to eat filled her up.   I love how everything is PINK. And the opportunity to take a picture on the swing and the phone booth was a bonus. I enjoyed it and can say that when we go north again I will stop by.
Taquero Mucho,40,I wish I could give them a 4.5 but I will give them a 5   Of course we all know it s super cute and pink  However when you walk in it was a little confusing bc there was no host stand just girls standing around at a table. But apparently they are getting a host stand just takes a few months bc of covid.   We were able to sit down pretty fast  we had a group of 4 of us and the table was a little too small we couldn t really fit all of our food. We had to play Tetris a few times to get it to all fit.   While the ambiance is great the music is pretty loud  You have to speak really loud to be able to talk. I get it  it s for the vibe but there are adults going that would really like to eat and chat    I see a lot of people complaining about the prices but honestly you are paying for the unique look of the food and drinks. The food and drinks are good  they are not great but I ve been to places with way worse food and not nearly as cute.  Overall it was a fun cool place would definitely come again.
Taquero Mucho,41,Taquero mucho is such a cute restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful and their pink drinks and fun LV chip paper is an Instagram dream. The food though was not up to par as the ambiance. We all got tacos and margaritas which were just okay. If you re looking for a fun Instagram worthy restaurant  highly recommend dining here but be prepared for mediocre food.
Taquero Mucho,42,Pink paradise with many instagrammable moments and delicious bites. A fun spot to pregame or postgame for the Domain or for Austin FC games. Additionally  this is a great place to bring your friends  order drinks and appetizers while dancing to dope DJs they host here.  I ordered the following  - Guacamole   8  - this was freshly smashed and served with totopos. Yum  - Shrimp Ceviche   16  - a decent-sized portion  tasted very fresh but could possibly use more chips. - Arranchera Asada   14  - of course  pink handmade corn tortilla  very on brand and delicious  I was pleased by the dish along with the rice and beans. - Tacos Dorados   12  - my fianc  ordered this and he said the tacos got a little soggy but since the place was super busy and in their soft opening phase  it was understandable. He was very pleased and was impressed by the price from such a hip spot. - High Maintenance   16  - this was a watermelon cbd margarita  love the idea of the pouch  especially since it came to fruition for to-go drinks but I didn t personally LOVE the flavors. - Actin  Kinda Shady   20  - y all  this drink came with ADORABLE pink heart sunglasses... and the drink  was DELISH.  This might not be a good spot for someone who doesn t enjoy loud music. But  we will be back and bring friends to have a really great time when we make it back up to north Austin  probably before an Austin FC game. Thanks Taquero Mucho 
Taquero Mucho,43,I ve read all the reviews on here before coming and it is really good. The chicken looks dry but it is full of meat because I was looking at other chicken and waffle review and I thought to myself. Why is it so small and dry but it is not. Service was good.
Taquero Mucho,44,Was excited for the refried black beans because I prefer them to pinto but unfortunately they had pork in them so I couldn t eat them. The fish ceviche was absolutely terrible and while the shrimp one was much better it still wasn t really good enough to get again. The queso was bomb but there s a huge dollop of guacamole which I think is unnecessary. My biggest issue with this restaurant is while it is cute and literally everything was pink  so 99  of the customers were women which is cool  we arrived at the end of brunch and the music was insanely loud. Not quite club level but much closer to it than it should ve been. If aesthetic is important for you then this place might be worth a visit but if you just want good food and a comfortable dining experience I d suggest getting elsewhere Edit  I went to heat up my leftover queso in the container they provided and it melted in the microwave. Was in there for a minute and completely disintegrated so the rating has been changed to reflect my disappointment.
Taquero Mucho,45,Went there for Happy Hour. The food came out fast and tasted amazing  Ordered the queso and tacos dorados  both of which I would order again. The service was great and the decor was cute  The music however was so loud that I felt like I was at the club and couldn t have a great conversation with my friend without yelling. My only recommendation is turn it down so people can talk.
Taquero Mucho,46,Meh... I see why people like it because it s very cutely decorated  but no coffee is served and 2 tacos cost  14. As for the guacamole  it didn t taste fresh and this is nearly day 1.  My wife and daughter like it  not me so far...
Taquero Mucho,47,Decided to try the new restaurant in the neighborhood and stopped in for lunch today. Bright pink. Everywhere. Ok  I get it  that s their theme  I can hang with it but the loud hip hop music really needs to go  or be turned down several notches.  We couldn t carry on a normal indoor conversation so we could have done without that. Service was prompt and courteous but when the wait person didn t write down our order I became somewhat suspicious.    I ordered the Arranchera Asada and Adobada tacos and asked for them them to be on flour instead of a corn tortilla.  As listed on the menu  they come with rice and beans. Unfortunately  when we got our order it was dropped off pretty quickly and I soon discovered I had corn tortillas. bleh. Oh well  he ll come back in a minute to ask how everything is and I can tell him. Or maybe not.  Didn t see him until we were done but I did mention I didn t get flour tortillas like I asked for. He apologized. I mean  what can he do   I m done now.  I didn t tell him that everything was lukewarm when it came out and if he d noticed that I didn t eat but a bite or two of my beans  he might have asked if I liked them but instead his only question was which taco was my favorite.  I played nice and told him the asada was my favorite  only because I ate it first and it had a some warmth in it.  OK  I m not trying to be mean. But  if I m going to pay  14 for what amounts to two street tacos and I m in a sit down restaurant  that isn t crowded  check up on me.  Ask me how everything was.  I should expect that my food should be hot especially when I m looking right at the kitchen where it came from. It s obvious they are getting settled in so I ll stop here and say that maybe in the future  when all the kinks are worked out  and they have their mojo goin   I can see about another try. But turn the music down guys 
Taquero Mucho,48,Really fun and cool place with everything being pink  including your corn tortillas . Guac was okay  Queso was really good and a huge bowl. Carna Asada Fajitas were amazing and a great portion  can definitely share. Chicken Quesadillas were really stuffed and good. Chicken Tinga and Carnitas Tacos were also also very good. Not sure why so many reviews say the food isnt great as our food beyond the guac was very tasty. We also didnt order chicken and waffles at a Mexican restaurant  The Pink Margs were also pretty good. I tried a rocks and a frozen and would say the rocks was stronger but frozen was smoother and overall better.   The only damper on the night was a DJ started playing music at around 5 45 and it was so loud we couldn t really enjoy the rest of the evening and got out of there shortly after  we were sitting really close to his stand but before 8pm seems way to early for a DJ    Might try take out next time or a weekday and hope the atmosphere is a little more chill.
Taquero Mucho,49,Taquero Mucho was created to be a place for women to go to feel celebrated and empowered. Dripping in pink feminine energy from pink tacos to pink margaritas  this cute little taqueria is one of Austin s newest staples for women.  For me  theming is a big plus - not just with food  but ambiance as well. Here they don t hold back with it s picturesque establishment with many opportunities for a mini photo shoot.  What did I get   To drink  - Anti-Bitch Juice  this strawberry frozen fros  is too good. It was refreshing and sweet - like having a boozy strawberry juice  Definitely get this   - High Maintenance  this house watermelon margarita with CBD was okay  felt it could have been a bit more sweet  but if you like your drinks a bit more balanced then you would like this.  To eat  - Queso Flameado  a decent choice for the table if you have cravings of chips and salsa  guac  and queso. However  I tried the Choriqueso at the first location and would actually suggest that one over this.  - Elote  a classic  This was surprisingly done very well   - Shrimp Ceviche  ceviche in town is either a hit or miss  and this was a hit. Good flavor   - Sopes de Arrachera  think of these almost as open faced tacos as it s a handmade corn masa base topped with refried beens  cabbage  tomatillo and avocado salsas  cream  queso fresco  pickled onions  and beer lime rubbed carne asada. These were my favorite dish here - highly suggest these   - Tacos Dorados  they take 3 chicken taquitos and top them off with cabbage  crema  queso fresco  green tomatillo sauce and sliced avocado  these were good  but nothing particularly exciting about them.  All in all  I had a good time here with friends. Some items were a hit  some were meh. The theme was great. The vibes were there. The service was good. The prices were fine. With that said  I give them a 3.5 5 for being a good spot to add to your list 
Taquero Mucho,50,This was a FUN vibe   Definitely a spot for social media captures. Well thought out design and everything was pinkilicious. There wasn t a nook that wasn t pink. I should have bought one of there pink souvenir shirts.   Had the mango drink with tamarind candy and the fish ceviche. Both were 5 5    Came here on a Friday evening and it was busy  but we were seated quickly after a short wait at the bar. If you are trying to have a conversation it can be on the loud side  There was a Dj spinning.   Would come back. I already recommended it to some visitors.
Taquero Mucho,51,Was killing time and a bad attitude when I saw this place was on the street I was on. Had seen posts on social media and decided to stop in. At first I was a bit turned off  that the music is so loud it seems like your in a club but I didn t want to be rude and walk out. They were very busy even for it being well after lunch time. So glad I decided to stay and order something. Sat down and had an anti bitch drink to go along with my shrimp tacos and street corn. Everything was good. The pink theme and decor is cute. It s a cool spot for good food and great social media pics.
Taquero Mucho,52,This place is for aesthetics and insta pics only.  Food is terrible and drinks aren t much better  and the service was pretty bad as well.  Be prepared to spend  50  a person. I ordered a drink  entree  and split an app with someone... was not worth the hype or the money imo but I did enjoy the atmosphere.  Would def come back during happy hour sometime but otherwise not worth it. Super disappointing    curious what the original location is like. Huge let down
Taquero Mucho,53,Food was delicious  Atmosphere was adorable and an IG dream  They have a lot of great menu options. Making a decision was tough so we will have to go back. As for the drinks  I found one of their specialty ones to be a bit sugary for my personal liking  but others may be ok with it.  Looking forward to to trying more menu items in the future 
Taquero Mucho,54,Beautiful place to take insta pics. Cute pink aesthetic. The food was decent and kinda on the expensive side. I was grossed out that the pinto beans were mixed with hotdog slices   I didn t see that mentioned anywhere on the menu and my partner doesn t eat pork. That was very disappointing.  -visiting guest from California
Taquero Mucho,55,Don t waste your time. Food  amp  drinks were awful. Unless your going to take some pictures for the gram stay away.
Taquero Mucho,56,Went there with high hopes but the food was average. Nice presentation of the food and service was great. I think this place is more for a one time experience to see all the pink . I had chicken and waffles. Chicken was dry. Waffle tasted ok thanks to the variety of berries it comes with.
Taquero Mucho,57,This place was Amazing definitely enjoyed the vibe everything here was Instagram and Snapchat worthy. I took pictures of almost everything and the food was very tasty and I like the theme and how they even have themed alcoholic beverages. I think they are very deserving of having for sure more than 4 stars on here and google. If people are complaining it s definitely for stupid crap haha.
Taquero Mucho,58,Super cute inside and a fun place to have girls night. Food is a little overhyped in my opinion. It s good but it could be better. The chicken tacos were good but the tortilla was a little soggy so it came apart easily. The beans were really good  and the rice needed a more flavor.   We also got the chips and guacamole and that was probably my favorite.
Taquero Mucho,59,I am so happy I tried this place out. Absolutely great atmosphere. The night I went there was a live DJ and the Vibez were lit. If in the domain area try it out.
Taquero Mucho,60,We went today and had food and drinks. Right as we are finishing our meal the electricity and internet goes out. The server keeps apologizing and we can t leave because they can t process our card due to the outage. This is unacceptable  I had to leave to check on our dog as it was getting late. As I m writing this my husband is still in that restaurant trying to close his tab. Never again   
Taquero Mucho,61,Cute place. Extremely loud music. I wasn t sure if it was a bar club or restaurant. Went w me bff and we had to yell at one another the whole time. Cool place for party goers and ppl that like to go out and be cute. Not quite the casual vibe I was looking for.
Taquero Mucho,62,We love patronizing the establishments in our neighborhood  The Domain  so we thought we d give this fun-looking place a try. We went in on a Saturday afternoon  and the music was so loud that literally it hurt my ears. We immediately bailed. We returned again a few weeks later  again on a Saturday. The music was still loud  but at least it wasn t rattling the fillings in my head. It is a very pink place. VERY pink. Between the pink  the music  and the diverse clientele  it almost felt like we were in Miami. The bartender was quick and efficient  and we ordered pink margaritas. The drinks were pretty good. This isn t a place I would hit every week  but I can see that it will be a fun place to visit from time to time. Welcome to the neighborhood  Taquero Mucho.
Taquero Mucho,63,I ve never been to the original location  so definitely wanted to try it out since it s close by. Absolutely love all the pink  Cool ambiance. Wait staff was friendly. Service was slow  even for a weekday  although I think the waiter was in training   Drinks were okay. Food was okay. The best thing is the pink homemade corn tortillas. I ordered the crispy shrimp tacos  which were delicious  The rice was meh  but in a cute heart shape  The beans looked like pork  amp  beans since it had a hotdog  in it. Take out the hotdog and it d be better. My friends said their food was so-so. The black beans looked like pudding. Remember that chorizo queso fundido is thick cheese and hard to eat with chips. I know this location is new and will have to work out some kinks  but definitely worth trying.
Taquero Mucho,64,First off   the place is super cute lol  A Man in pink is where it s at     Greeted as soon as we walked in and super friendly and sweet host. Sat at bar because it s full service. Place is also popin if you like loud music  if not  i do not recommend coming here. Anways  the poppers were sooooo good. Shrimp and jalape os  The crunch in them was perfect and jalape os were not too spicy. The birria tacos are yummy  The meat in the tacos braised so soft and flavorful  The rice is tatsy also. I am Hispanic and do not like beans  do not tell my mom this lol   but the beans here .... man they are gooood    My better half ordered the shrimp tacos and she inhaled them      Ashley was attentive and super nice at the bar. Angel is also super friendly and on top of everything. Over all .... yes definitely recommend this place  Also taquero mucho my fellow yelpers   Oh   And the cbd margarita was yummoooo    
Taquero Mucho,65,Atmosphere was great. Guest service was also great. Anti B     Juice was excellent. Food was magnificent.
Taquero Mucho,66,Food was DIVINE  I absolutely loved the Chorizo Queso  One of the best appetizers i ve had. Will definitely come back for more  Bonus  the entire resturaunt was pink  Perfect place to bring your sister  girlfriend  or wife. 10 10 
Taquero Mucho,67,best restaurant in north austin. Service was QUICK  Food arrived in 10 minutes after ordering. Even though it was busy we were sat quickly. food was AMAZING. give them ur coins.
Taquero Mucho,68,I m surprised this place only has a 3 star average review  I ve been to the downtown location a few times and I just visited the new north location last night. My friend and I made it in time to grab some drinks  a shot  and guac all from the happy hour menu. The pink classic margarita on the rocks was perfection. After a bit of catching up she ordered a steak quesadilla and I got the 2 taco plate. Each time I come to Taquero Mucho I m happy with the food. You d think that with the explosion of the IG picturesque decor and the cute creative drinks  the food would be meh  but every time I really like what I eat  Last night was no different. I got the crispy shrimp taco and the arranchera asada taco  and it comes with rice and beans. Both tacos were so fresh and delicious.  Service was great and luckily we had no wait on a Thursday night. The restaurant is big but does not have a patio. Since we scored some happy hour prices  my bill was only  36 
Taquero Mucho,69,Hype trap. Music too loud. You literally cannot hear the person sitting right next to you at your own table. It was too hot. I dont sweat much  and when I do  usually just my palms  however  it was so hot here I feel like my hard plastic seat was developing a puddle. Chaotic environment. People forming lines to take photos around the restaurant. And those people bumping into your tables backing up to get a better angle. Staff running around and don t even let patrons get by first  they act like we are in their way. They brought out everyone s food at varying times. So  unless you want to be rude to your friends  everything gets cold by the time everyone is served. . tortilla crisps totally should ve been served on the side... tortilla chips in my soup got very soggy while waiting for everyone else to be served at the table. I enjoyed my the fruit slush drinks. But  take it to go and save yourself the experience. Overall disorienting that it feels like daytime in here even at night. Maybe a one time experience.
Taquero Mucho,70,The owner Gabriella needs to come and check in on this place. Yes the food is alright. You will get your Instagram moment. There is no order here. Pretty sure there is no SOP for new hires. Every server is constantly on their cell phone. We counted minimum both bartenders were not behind the bar 3x. Meanwhile we see our drinks standing there for 10 min and no attempt to deliver.  That I blame the server    This place has been open barely a year and the floors are filthy. I know I may sound high strung  but the table next to us did not get cleaned for 20 min. Our waiter came to us only 3x.  This place was not busy  and I can see why.  10 o clock on a Saturday night    It s almost like the owner hired her family with no experience and wanted them to figure it out. Just get the food out and drinks out.  No matter how long it takes or how little you check on the client   The only identity this place has figured out is PINK. If you want to make your money being IG-Worthy  maybe save some money and skimp out on offering guests food and drink - clearly you care more about the  content  than the actual experience.  And I m just surprised on everyone who rates this 5 stars for their drinks. I question if their best drink was a cherry vodka sour from 6th street.   Let me end this with I rarely post on Yelp and my boyfriend wanted to go next door to dos salsas.  He was right this time.
Taquero Mucho,71,Went for my nieces birthday and we had such a great experience  I went in after reading all the negative reviews and we were pleasantly surprised that the food was good and it was such a cute eatery  The only downside was those adult beverages  They were so strong we couldn t really enjoy them. I know some people like them like that but I wasn t there to get drunk  so I couldn t even drink 1 3 of it and they weren t cheap  Other than that overall great experience for a girls day out 
Taquero Mucho,72,Well  I love pink so how could this place go wrong  Seriously though  they have amazing drinks and delicious food  They had a DJ when we were there in a Saturday afternoon which was super fun.
Taquero Mucho,73,Don t let the discrete exterior fool you  This place is so fabulously extra that I could cry sparkly pink tears of joy. Such incredible visual and auditory aesthetics immediately transform whatever mood you may have entered in into jovial and ready  The DJ s hip hop- tejano- Latin mashups are groovy  beb .   The service is attentive  timely  friendly  and unobtrusive. They re always so kind about how giddy I am about being in such a lovely space   The cocktails are unique  balanced  and delicious  I really love the Anti Bitch Juice for a multitude of reasons. The michelada is also a giant step for woman kind.  The food. You may think that because I ve raved about the other elements so much that they surpass the quality of the food but that s not the case. The food is consistently fantastic  High quality  delicious  and as expected  pretty     The owner of this fine establishment should be the mayor of Austin  Scratch that. Gabby for president 2024 
Taquero Mucho,74,I absolutely loooove the vibe here  I felt so empowered while eating brunch. CRAZY I KNOW lol  The ambiance is great  The staff is super kind  And the food and drinks were MIND BLOWING   I won t lie I was skeptical going in  thinking the only hype were the cute photo ops buttttttt I was proven wrong. I feel the food is great  main character energy  and the photo ops are the plus bonus. Ms. Ma am you re business is unique and ASTONISHING    Why there are only few stars rating is kinda off  so don t believe that. This place is . Ooooo I almost forgot and they had a DJ spinning and scratching  Taquero Mucho  you have raised my standards  Cheers
Taquero Mucho,75,Super disappointed in this place - sad to say. I mean  come on - who charges the same price for a mock tail as they do for the same drink with alcohol  They were out of vodka so we ordered it without alcohol and they charged us the alcohol price. When I inquired  they said  sorrry  it s the same price  - wtf  The server said   yeah   everybody complains about that  ....... So  Could you not at least warn us    The food was edible but nothing special  it s definitely only popular for it s pink-ness.  I don t leave reviews often but this place is a definite miss
Taquero Mucho,76,I love this place     The food  drinks  and atmosphere never disappoints. Good place for a girls evening out.
Taquero Mucho,77,Service was decent  food came out super fast and hot. Miguel was great. Sucks the food hurt his image.  If your a Mexican food critic  don t come here. Tex-mex is more promising. I got the avocado cream enchiladas and it was drowning in the sauce. I couldn t eat it cause it was like eating straight up sauce. The rice was bland. The beans were bland  potential but lacked seasoning. My partner got the tacos dorados and they were just flautas. They were dry and needed some serious kick. The salsa requested to help the flavor had less flavor than water. The queso was so liquified  I don t understand how cheese can have no consistency. The drinks were fine. The atmosphere was expected. Don t come here for food. 2 stars was due to the service. Food alone would ve been -2 stars.
Taquero Mucho,78,Sadly  I was expecting more from this place. From the food  drinks to the service I can t say I ll be going to this location any more. I order some tinga tacos. The tortillas was hard and cold. I ended up eating only one and leaving the rest. My bf had ordered a paloma and his was way to weak even for me. Our waitress was rude and even brought our table ticket without us asking for it. The only recusable thing about this place was the decor. It is pretty on the inside but the service and the food drinks are not worth it. We will try the other location though. Wish us luck 
Taquero Mucho,79,Was not good at all.  Had no flavor    Left and went to Burger King for better food   Run
Taquero Mucho,80,I been to this place before and we loved it. Hence  we decided to come back to enjoy the food and drinks. However this past weekend  not sure what happened. At first it was a good start  they got our drinks out really quickly. Then  our food got here and we noticed that we ended up getting corn Tortillas instead of flour ones that we ordered. We waited for the waitress to come back. Never did. I even asked another waitress. She said she will be back  but never did either. We decided to leave it be. However  we were waiting for more water or to order more drinks plus napkins. The waitress never came back since the beginning of our stay. I had to go to the front to ask for water and even then they still didn t serve us our drinks. Until still waiting for service. We decided to leave. Not a good experience.   I give it two stars  because the food was good.
Taquero Mucho,81,We tried out this new location during their grand opening weekend and got seats at the bar. The place is pink inside out and wonderful for a date spot or to take visiting friends and family for the experience.  The chips and queso were good. There were enough queso for a table of 4  to share. The tacos were about average  nothing to ride home about. If you re hungry  the 2 tacos and the sides may not be filling.  The pink margarita was good  though for the price  it is on the smaller side. For dessert  the tres leches was excellent.
Taquero Mucho,82,Good food  Great refreshing drinks  Love the Instagram environment. Definitely check this place out.
Taquero Mucho,83,Overall average food but amazing atmosphere and drinks. To me the food wasn t worth this restaurant s hype but the atmosphere was very interesting and Instagram-able. The queso was yummy and the drinks were tasty. I m not a local but I prob wouldn t go back either way. Our waiter also wasn t very attentive and seemed to have an attitude   . Don t waist your money on the food but go for a quick drink and cute pic 
Taquero Mucho,84,Great ambiance  great drinks  great music. We came for a Galentines brunch and the place was PACKED. The kitchen was clearly slammed and the food was overall just okay. I got the queso birria tacos and they were really good  The rice that accompanied them was pretty bland though. We also got the queso  which was good  and the elote appetizer  which was just meh. I think if you go in with the right mindset and expectations  you ll have a great time.
Taquero Mucho,85,In celebration for a close friend s birthday  we chose Taquero Mucho for our post- happy hour dinner. Our party of 8 walked in with no reservation  and was seated quickly.   The atmosphere was lively and I found it unique to have the self-serve salsa at our disposal  while we were served chips. Everything tasted great    The pricing is a little high for the quality  amp  size of the dishes  but as it s in the middle of the city  that is to be expected.   My only complaint would be the weird handling of their POS system being down. While it was creative  it did not serve the whole table well. Our server offered us to Venmo him  all under one payment  and then he would cover the cost once the system was up. Within  a few minutes  it was running  amp  we were updated. However  upon my asking for the check  he brought the recipes saying the bills absolutely must be split 4-ways and people couldn t pay for their meals individually. As I had to leave early  I covered the meal of a friend  but wish that information was disclosed as the beginning of our meal.
Taquero Mucho,86,Starting out  the waitress seemed to be in a rush. We had just sat down and right away   are you ready to order  ...we just sat. She seemed like she was ready to get us in and out  not very pleasant. It s a pretty place but... just that. We ordered our entr es and well... let s just say none of us finished our meal due to the taste  such an odd taste. We came to realization that this place is only for looks and social media. Try the down town location  maybe you ll have better luck with the food  atmosphere and won t feel rushed to leave. Good luck Tequero Mucho.
Taquero Mucho,87,Okay where do I start  I reached out and let them know I would have a large group of people with me   1 month in advance . I run a brunch business and after reviewing their website  I loved that they were focused on Women Empowerment as the owner is an amazing business owner. I had to follow up multiple times across multiple platforms  only to find out they did not do reservations at all for any reason. I was transferred to so many different people and than received an email back saying they didn t need any professional photos from my business as they have their own marketing team.  I asked for a reservation in exchange for brand photos from a professional photographer  Now  personally  I think it is ridiculous to have to wait HOURS to eat at a restaurant especially in heels where it was cold outside and there is no sitting waiting area  However the members of my club requested this place many times so we drove all the way from San Antonio to enjoy this place... waiting 1.5 hours to be seated.  not terrible but it was cold  Our table was pushed so far back that EVERY SINGLE SERVER that walked behind me had food DIRECTLY ABOVE MY HEAD... i was literally ducking the entire time I sat down trying not to get hit.... the server was relatively good. I asked for a bottle of Ros  for mimosas and was told they didn t have anymore. Asked for another idea that could be served to the table as a group and was pitched the  12 EACH SPECIAL DRINK  When I said no thanks... suddenly there might be bottles in the back. The constant trying to upsell was disappointing. I ordered 2 bottles and they were brought to the table. No juice was provided and by the time it was brought the bottles were already mostly gone. Fast forward to the food..... it was mediocre at best. My food did not come with everyone else s food and it was cold when I got it. It was also so loud you couldn t even talk to the person sitting directly next to you let alone across the table. Overall  I was very disappointed. The pretty decor was about the only highlight of the day in terms of the restaurant. I was hoping it would be better.... but at least I can say I did it. Likely won t ever again. As for my brunch group... they had a fun time so guess I did my best to cover up all the things that were actually going wrong.
Taquero Mucho,88,The cutest place  i ve always wanted to go check it out. Our server was super nice and the food drinks came within 10 minutes. The queso was average but I enjoyed the guacamole a lot. My tacos were also very good and the pink tortillas were a great addition. I got a ranch water and a watermelon shot and they were both good and strong. The beans with hotdogs were interesting but all in all I would definitely go back.
Taquero Mucho,89,Amazing service thank you so much Diana for the service and remembering us  So sweet and make me come back bc service is great 
Taquero Mucho,90,Stopped in at the Domain location for National Margarita day and it was a great experience. The margs are strong and the menu offers many delicious sounding options for food and drink. Everything is pink in many shades and hues. Music was great  definitely set the vibe for the place. We started with chips and queso  I love when chips are seasoned w more than just salt. My friend got the enchiladas plate and I got the Baja shrimp tacos  one w flour and one w corn because it says they make the corn tortillas in house. Indeed it was a great corn tortilla and so rare to find ones that claim to be homemade and delicious. I cannot rave enough about the rice    Perfectly fluffy  very well cooked  I only wished it was more seasoned but still no complaints on it  I could ve ate just that and been happy. Let s get to the reason for one star being docked...the beans...if you long for the nostalgia of beanie weenies without bbq sauce or franks and beans without bbq sauce it s exactly that flavor. The hotdogs are off putting texturally and it doesn t taste like much of anything but salt and hotdog water. Hard pass on the beans next time and need a different option as a substitute. Otherwise interior is an Instagram pics dream with lots of great photo ops.
Taquero Mucho,91,Great food and they even added some new menu items for both locations   Love my pink glasses which came with the Shady drink. Ishmael was an outstanding server 
Taquero Mucho,92,The best drinks and food ever    The tacos are so good and margaritas are great  Must go to taquero mucho if you are in town
Taquero Mucho,93,We came here for brunch and was amazed at the beautiful pink decor. Very cute for selfies and videos. They had a DJ and the DJ was jamming out and everybody was singing along to the jams. One Table even got up and started dancing. The food was good and we enjoyed our drinks. Our waiter Miguel gave us good recommendations and was very attentive. We enjoyed our visit and will come back again.
Taquero Mucho,94,So  I went on the grand opening night which was cute but needed more time. The food was okay was not as tasteful as I thought it would be. Service was a little horrible which was a bit expected just because it was their grand opening. The rice was too bland and vegetables tasted like hot boiling water. I like it for pictures and chill vibes but the food i would not recommend.
Taquero Mucho,95,It s SOOOOOOO LOUD. I don t understand why. I get that  it s a vibe   but it s nearly impossible to hold a conversation. A tall  white booth houses the live DJ and he stands out like a boxed Barbie. The amped Reggaeton beats set expectations before you even step inside and they don t ever stop or lower. My server got my order wrong because  understandably  she COULDN T HEAR ME. That being said  the food is good  like really  good. Cocktails are fun  especially the CBD-infused High Maintenance  that s packaged to-go. Oh yeah  and I died and went to pink heaven and got the all the pics to prove it in front of the adorable Insta-worthy installations.  I went 3 times over the course of seven days because the cuteness overload makes it a unique spot to take visitors and I just happened to have a lot of in-towners that week. Just make sure you re all caught up BEFORE you go  because you won t be able to hear them.
Taquero Mucho,96,The music is LOUD  you cannot have a decent conversation loud. The waitstaff was a little behind and it took about 15 minutes from the time we were sat until we received water to drink  no alcohol was ordered. The food came fast and it was really good. We ordered the carnitas plate and the shrimp tacos. The shrimp was under seasoned by itself but when eaten with the taco as intended it was good. They have a lot of cute photo ops set up. Overall good experience but if you have someone in your party triggered by loud music I would avoid.
Taquero Mucho,97,Good vibes  Great happy hour and food is delicious    playlist is amazing  whoever is on dj needs a raise
Taquero Mucho,98,If you are looking for good vibes  insta-worthy photo ops  strong drinks  and great happy hours  Taquero Mucho is the place for you. If you are looking for good food  I wouldn t recommend it.
Taquero Mucho,99,Staff and ambiance was great  Drinks and food were mediocre   Drinks looked amazing but had way to much liquor. We couldn t taste the flavors mango  strawberry  just liquor.
Taquero Mucho,100,Saw this taco spot on tik tok and immediately was drawn to the pink aesthetic. We decided to try it out on our day trip to Austin and I am so glad we did. I was a bit reluctant about the food tasting good  mainly because I assumed they are only an insta worth photo op spot. But  man was i wrong  the food was really delicious. Definitely try the elote and queso to start off the meal  The chips are amazing  I had their tacos carne asada and they were seasoned very good. The rice and beans were very special as well. Overall  food was a 9 10. The only reason I am giving this place 4 out of 5 stars is because of the extremely loud  almost club-like  music. It was difficult to order our food because the server couldn t here us and we couldn t here him. And I wasn t really expecting to have lunch with such loud music... mind you we went on a Sunday at 2pm... so no reason to have such loud music. Other than that the ambiance of the restaurant was unique and provided several photo op spots.
Taquero Mucho,101,The food was good  however  two of our party decided to sit at the bar and were denied drinks because he believed that their IDs were a fake even though they already served us at the table. The restaurant needs to serve their servers across the board rather than be wishy washy about it. Disappointed beyond all means.
Taquero Mucho,102,I was surprised by this place  and in a good way actually. Initially  I came in thinking this Insta-worthy place was all for the aesthetics and vibes BUT I ended up really liking their tacos de carne asada  the meat was not dry  which is a huge plus of course  and their chips  came out so warm and crunchy which I absolutely love    guac  just missing some lime flavoring  but that s a personal taste thing . The only thing I was not super impressed with is that our waitress did not seem to be too familiar with the menu and did not really  sell  it to us. My 2 friends and I were asking a few questions since it was our first time and she was a little too honest saying she had never tried this or that dish. We all ended up getting the same thing aka their most popular  Arranchera Asada  but were not expecting the side of rice and beans. Overall though  a yummy food experience. The music got progressively loud  so maybe the DJ could take a chill pill on that lol  it was around 6pm when we went . Lastly  there was one instance where a lot of the waiters were huddled around  and I get it  homiesquadvibes but we literally waved at them for a solid 15 seconds until we finally caught their attention . Parking is sufficient  so that should not be a problem. Overall  4 stars for me.
Taquero Mucho,103,I ve gave this place a shot twice and I m just not feeling it. The owners are the same as Gabriela s but I prefer Gabriela s. I m not sure what it is but the drinks here aren t the same. The food isn t the same. Maybe the employees idk but I ll stick to Gabriela s from here on out.
Taquero Mucho,104,So it was my Daughter s 18th birthday her Favorite Color is Pink so what Perfect Place to have a Family Dinner that would include her 84 year old Great Grandmother whom since the Pandemic Doesn t go many places anymore but wouldn t have missed this moment for nothing...Anyway from the start I knew it was going to be problems starting with their rule of Not separating the bill  ok we ll figure it out  then as my very classy family of Color poured in Accommodations became a problem. Because the Music was SO loud  I had no idea the Manager was having words with my husband meanwhile I m telling the waitresses to bring out Chips  Queso Salsa for our guests she much obliged without informing me of the situation going on between her boss and my husband. By the time I am aware  168 worth of Chips Queso Salsa and 2 cocktails were being consumed. In short my Daughter s much anticipated moment didn t go as planned as we ended up having to move our party to a Restaurant more accepting of a Classy COLORFUL Family...and Grandma well she made her appearance took several pictures ate a few chips sipped a little water and called it a night  Thanks you very much Taquero Mucho i assure you we will NEVER bring our unwanted presence in your establishment again oh and i hope the Tip was included in that overly priced bill 
Taquero Mucho,105,This place is adorable but the brunch menu is so bland wouldn t come again on a Sunday. Also our waiter was not attentive because we only ordered guacamole and taquitos papas appetizer. The food was good but thought it was weird even though we ordered guacamole we have to order salsa too. So basically if you want guacamole and chips and salsa it s  14.  Lastly  the water cups are so small. We had to get up twice to ask for more water. We will try again on regular menu in future but not anytime soon.
Taquero Mucho,106,Have you ever wanted to eat in the middle of a crowded nightclub at 2 pm on a Saturday  If so  this is the spot for you. What is a cute concept has been so inefficiently implemented that it is plainly unenjoyable. Although our server was very kind  quick  and professional  only she and one other employee were attentive while the other six stood around clueless. After overcoming the extremely loud music to be able to order  we were forced to forgo conversation as we could not hear each other. We were served quickly  but the food was utterly unappetizing due to the cheap cuts of meat contributing to overly greasy presentation and taste. While this would be a great place for evening drinks before going out  I would avoid for mealtimes.
Taquero Mucho,107,Why go here  It s a New Austin hip vibe  young  Instagram crowd   food is decent.  Why avoid  New Austin hip vibe  everybody is Instagramming  couple even had camera recording their entire meal . PARKING IS EXTORTION.  16 per hour on early Friday afternoon.  Didn t love it  but seems to do well with a certain crowd. Parking rates need to be posted so that people don t get trapped into exorbitant fees when they re already out of their cars and party is being seated. That left an incredibly bad taste.
Taquero Mucho,108,I was hoping for the best with this one  The place is adorable and my 15 year old niece loved it due to the instagramability of the interior  but the food and service missed the mark.  It took our server a while to show up to the table and take our drink order  which is fine.  They seemed busy  and I don t usually factor service into the review.   I can deal with bad service but not bad food.   I ordered the elote and fish ceviche for my meal and my niece got the avocado cream enchiladas.  She loved them  I took a little dip of the cream sauce and it was delicious.  The rice was also delicious.  Sometimes the rice isn t done well at a lot of tex mex places  but this was good   Also  the elote was delicious.  A bit oily  but I ate it all.  The server ended up bringing me the shrimp ceviche   2 more   but it was fine being that I also like shrimp.  But the were very few pieces of shrimp.  I d say maybe 2-3 shrimps total.  Mostly pico and a thicker sauce.  And  the tostada served with it was stale.  I had to ask for chips  I expect way more from a  16 ceviche.  I also had a Paloma that was pretty mediocre.  I probably won t be back unless I have another out of town guest that really wants to go.
Taquero Mucho,109,I had never been here before and it s been on my list so when the north location opened  we came with family visiting from out of town. The high maintenance drink was good and strong but that s about the only positive comment I have. Multiple people in my party received their food but it was incorrect in some way. I told the server that my sopas didn t have anything but lettuce and meat when it s supposed to have avocado creams and cream along with other things. When he took it back to correct  they added the missing cheese and pickled onions but not the two things I specifically mentioned. I was tired of waiting for my food so I ate it. It was pretty good but not worth the hype. Two other people at my table got the same tacos with different toppings when they made no changes. It seems like they don t know their own menu. It s nice decor but the music is so loud it s like you re in the club. You can barely hear the server. We had a large group so there is an automatic 20  gratuity which is fine but it seems like the server maybe didn t care since he s getting 20  regardless. I m happy to pay it but I wish we had service that came even close to 20  value. On top of everything  we waited 45min to be seated and another hour to get food just to get it all wrong. Overall  I think the hype has killed what probably was a great restaurant at one time.
Taquero Mucho,110,Love this place  Food and drinks have always been amazing. The vibe is super fun  Yes it s always crowded  but the staff has always been quick  accommodating  and friendly  Also love that it s locally owned 
Taquero Mucho,111,Place was smaller than I thought but beautiful    food 10 10 delicious but workers kind of rude
Taquero Mucho,112,Nice place to go to start your evening in the ATX.  Good food selection and the drinks were great.  There was even a DJ spinning to maintain the energy which SHE did.  I will come here again and also the menu prices are on target
Taquero Mucho,113,You walk in and see workers on their phone and not really paying attention and kinda off. The music is blasting so you can barely hear what the person is saying to you. The owner who is Latina and prides herself over it should really focus on her cultural food instead of vomiting the color pink every inch of the place. In both locations the food is freezing cold and no flavor. The service is horrible as well    
Taquero Mucho,114,Not only does this place look good  the food taste good too  I got the Arrachera asada tacos and friends and I shared the queso and guac. This is the best queso and guac I have ever had so I definitely recommend getting it  We also got the anti bitch juice and that is a must have when you come here.
Taquero Mucho,115,I love this place so much   It s super nice  cute and pink  I absolutely enjoyed the ambiance  the service and the food. Everything tasted amazing and the service was great. I highly recommend  10 10  Can t wait to go back 
Taquero Mucho,116,I was there a couple of days ago with a friend and got a margarita  horrible margarita btw  and then they asked for IDs which is normal  so we gave them the IDs and the bartenders checked them. After we got our drinks the manager came up to us asking for IDS again which we did  and asked why  Then he proceeded to tell us he didn t want our business and asked us to leave we asked why again  and he said we have an attitude and took our drinks away.  Never going back to this place.
Taquero Mucho,117,Very disappointed. This restaurant is mainly for  hype  photo attraction only. Servers walk with little purpose  server was very friendly but customer service was lacking. Requested water refill three times before bringing a dispenser to the table. The Chiroqueso menu item was either over cooked or product of government cheese that does not melt. Once receiving my entree  I immediately notice the food was room temperature warm. The meal wasn t even hot  so I presume not fresh. I don t recommend the food  nice atmosphere  compliments to the interior designer.
Taquero Mucho,118,Pros  ambiance. This place was beautifully renovated in pink decor. It used to be black Walnut Cafe but has been turned into a clean  hip  posh  restaurant with photo backgrounds throughout . It has a fun  romantic feel. Located next to a bar and across from Top Golf and the Domain. Nice hostess. Live DJ during weekend brunch. Cons  parking is sparse. music was way too loud  we had to tell our conversations. Food was nothing special. Drinks were a bit overpriced but good  I had the El Chapo margarita . It s very busy and hectic so don t expect a chill environment.The waiter forgot my wife s meal. When we asked where her food was  he said he didn t know she wanted that. Maybe if they turn down the music  the waiters could concentrate on orders. Overall  it s a cute place to dine at least once but don t expect to have great service or food.
Taquero Mucho,119,I just want to let y all know that your location on Burnet road was awful. The servers did not understand how to serve in a timely manner or how to act around customers. We had to wait a good 30 minutes to even get water  Moreover  the bar staff did not know how to make any of the drinks on your menu which meant that each drink took 15 minutes to 30 minutes to come out. The manager was also a complete mess and no help at all. Lastly  the margaritas that are supposed to be strawberry  pink marg  literally tasted like straight tequila so maybe put that on the menu. I think the concept of the restaurant is amazing  but the service is absolutely awful. I would not recommend to anyone this location or the restaurant because the service is awful.
Taquero Mucho,120,Not only is the food delicious the whole vibe here is Aesthetically pleasing  They had a DJ playing bangers on a Tuesday  Love this place. DONT Get discouraged by the parking situation  Its so worth it 
Taquero Mucho,121,I would have scored higher but I wasn t blown away by anything the restaurant had to offer. The drink was ok but really syrupy and my friend had way too much chamoy in hers. I did watch my tables bar drinks sit at the bar pick up for a good 10 minutes so by the time they reached our party they were really watered down and small for the price. The food was ok but I expected more of a variety of food and was kind of hoping to try the birra tacos which were only offered for brunch. Music was good but it could ve not been played so loudly. Felt like we were shouting to have a conversation the whole time. I wouldn t recommend taking a first date their unless you want to yell the entire time. Finally our waitress was not very attentive to our table. Took about 10 minutes to get water after we were sat at our table another 10 or so to get our drinks order and like I said previously they sat at the bar for another good 10. Didn t check up on us and didn t ask our table if we were paying separately or together. All and all I get your wanting to appeal to the IG crowd mainly but if actual people actually want a meal and good drink they may want to rethink eating here.
Taquero Mucho,122,The service was so bad  do not go here.  We had a party of 8 and when the waitress came to take our order  she was annoyed that everyone was not ready to order.  She was rude and told us when she comes back in 2 minutes  and  everyone better be ready.   She had an attitude and said she was busy yet the patio was wide open.  We unfortunately ended up leaving.   We ve been dying to try this place  and it looks like we never will
Taquero Mucho,123,The ambiance here is hip and trendy  but don t be fooled    if you re looking for an incredibly delicious  thoughtful and satisfying menu -- this place isn t it. The food was very disappointing. The quality was poor and the drinks are outrageously overpriced. I was really bummed out about the experience overall.
Taquero Mucho,124,Food wasn t that great didn t have flavor. It s only nice for a quick Instagram picture. The service was horrible  poor management. A customer got into it with a  waitress and they didn t even kick anyone out after that. It s such a joke waited 2.5 hours for nasty food and service wouldn t recommend. Not worth going at all. They had a DJ that played music so loud it s like you re in a club  you can t even talk to the people you re with you have to yell. It s a super tight space  they tried to give us only 2 tables for 13 people they added another table cause we complained about it. Overall the first location was 100  better and the food actually had flavor. The owner really should pay attention to the 2nd location for sure.
Taquero Mucho,125,probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Terrible service  Would give a 0 if I could
Taquero Mucho,126,Very over hyped  wait was long to get in and wait was long to receive food. Food was average. Music was unnecessarily loud.
Taquero Mucho,127,Drinks are good. Had to order three different times since they were out of this or that. Waitress and kitchen need to communicate to not allow this to happen. Queso dip appetizer was burnt  it smelled burnt as it was placed on table but waitress still served it. Ordered tacos and there was hair in the food. Unacceptable and quite disgusting with the entire experience. Wouldn t say I would be coming back anytime soon.
Taquero Mucho,128,So good   Go during happy hour for great drink deals. They don t take reservations but if you can go earlier towards the beginning of their happy hour  you ll get a table really easily 
Taquero Mucho,129,It was our first time there we were celebrating a friends birthday.  We were all excited about trying out this place . The service was terrible  Our server Junior took forever to bring our food  drinks   screwed up the check in a insanely way    brought out our food before a appetizer which he never brought out. Very disappointed we will not be going back . The birthday celebration was a bust  
Taquero Mucho,130,I went the week after opening with a girlfriend  there was no one at the host stand upon walking in. No one came to the host stand  luckily we found two spots at the bar top. It took a while to be greeted after sitting down  there s MAYBE 10 seats at the bar top  so not too much to keep from greeting new guests. The bartender was just very s l o w. I could tell she was new to the industry  later she told us she s never bartended before  WOW   because she kept only making one item at a time. Take my drink order  walk away to make it  then came back and asked my friend for her drink order.... Just highly inefficient. For mostly batch drinks and frozen margaritas  they should be pumping drinks out  But hey  that s her tips... Food runner was so awkward  he didn t announce what food he had and our guacamole was just in a ramekin. No plate or anything  just a ramekin... I ordered the cubano sandwich and y all  they put a hot dog on this sandwich. A HOT DOG. the bread was too hard  it was a terrible take on the easiest sandwich ever. The drinks were good and the food was meh. Maybe I ll go back in a few months when things are more ironed out but just think of this as a cute place to grab a drink before having dinner somewhere else. Also  yes the music is too loud.
Taquero Mucho,131,Clean. Food was edible. Nothing was better than okay. Music was way too loud  weeknight at 7pm . It appears like the purpose is a photo opp more than a good restaurant. Now I know.
Taquero Mucho,132,Visited this restaurant as a first stop into Austin after driving 2.5 hours with friends. My friend and I both ordered the crispy shrimp tacos which came with rice and beans. We had some questions about the beans and the server told us the beans were cooked in bacon and neither my friend nor I eat bacon so we asked for a substitute. When we got our food and started eating  both of us tasted bacon in the shrimp tacos and called the server over who was adamant that there was no bacon and then immediately walked away. We tried again to eat the food and STILL were finding pieces of bacon or some sort of meat in the food. We finally talked to the manager  who was even more apathetic about the situation than our server and again said there s no meat in the tacos. Neither employee even tried to look at the food and just totally invalidated that we were eating bacon meat. We had to ask for a different menu item since neither of us felt comfortable eating the food. I only eat fish and have not had any other meat in 5 years so I was highly disappointed in my experience at Taquero Mucho.
Ensenada ATX,1,probably my favorite food right now is these fish tacos  they r splendid. worth every penny. i find it hard to find a good fish taco. the fish can be dry  or there s too much cole slaw  or it s bland  or it s too greasy.   this fish taco is perfeeeeeccctttt  delicious  crispy outside flakey and moist inside  perfect amount of toppings and flavorful without being too salty or heavy. they re satisfying and also light. i don t know how that s possible but there you have it. i just talked myself into going to get some this weekend.
Ensenada ATX,2,I have tried food from one end of the Country to around the world  the food here is FANTASTIC. Being that I ve tasted real authentic Mexican food  I m here to say this is by far is one of the best Fish Tacos and Shrimp cocktails in the city of Austin.   My husband found this place after watching me try countless places to be disappointed. I m loving he found this place   The owner of this truck was named Liz  a lovely lady. They only have a shrimp cocktail on Saturday and Sunday  and once it sells out  it s gone. Order it with avocados. You ll be glad you did  
Ensenada ATX,3,Really good  I was the first customer of the day at 11am and the owner was very welcoming. A steady stream of people immediately followed.   The fish taco  shrimp taco and ceviche tostada plus shrimp  weekend special  were all tasty. Even with the fried filling  the tacos were light and didn t feel greasy. To me  the shrimp taco has a slight edge over the fish. The tacos have a small drizzling of hot sauce on top in addition to the pico de gallo and it was enough to get my nose running. I d suggest ordering it on the side if you re sensitive to heat.   There are a few picnic tables with umbrellas to dine at and some fans to keep things cool. I ll be back 
Ensenada ATX,4,Far too many of my dining partners here in ATX are pescatarians  so I was glad to learn about Ensenada. Owned by a mother-daughter team from Ensenada in Baja California  they operate out of a truck on MLK that opend last month.   The combination is simple  lightly battered fish and shrimp topped with cabbage  tomatoes  sour cream  some kind of a  habanero   salsa  and layered on top of a white corn tortilla. Light  filling  and satisfying in the 103-degree Austin heat.   Shrimp cocktails and ceviche tostadas are also available on the weekends. Prices   6  are a bit higher than I d like  but these tacos absolutely hit the spot in a town where fish and shrimp tacos  much less Baja-style ones  are rarely part of the menu.
Ensenada ATX,5,So glad I stopped in on the weekend to this place   I d heard about it on Eater and it s so close to my house. My partner and I ordered the fish tacos  shrimp tacos  and the weekend special tostada.  I also snagged some salsa macha  it s a seca salsa  like a Mexican chili oil  that they had on hand to use in cooking later.  The fish and shrimp were crisp and light with great flavor. The tostada was very balanced  add extra shrimp on top   and paired great with the salsa verde and salsa macha.  It s BYOB and they have FULLY decked out michaldas to go with your beers that are no joke.  Fantastic  light seafood faire and a very welcome addition to eats on the East Side.
Ensenada ATX,6,Finally    These Ensenada seafood style tacos have been grossly underrepresented here in Austin. I have always referred to them as Baja style so if that s what is familiar to you  then you must come out and try them. Your will not be disappointed.     I m all about women minority owned establishments too so when I saw their fish tacos in my IG feed  I literally put it on my calendar to visit the same week. So glad I did    Nom nom. Looking forward to eating here with some friends.
Ensenada ATX,7,Delicious food all around. We tried a shrimp and fish taco each  We all agreed that the shrimp was a bit more flavorful but both were absolutely scrumptious. On the weekends  come early for the ceviche. It was bomb. To be honest  I was a bit hungry still after  but these are deeply satisfying baja style tacos  and I lived in San Diego for 4 years    There seem to be a few things that they re working out with their system - they had forgotten some tacos and got a few orders wrong  and I noticed with some other parties too . I expect these will be fixed soon though and won t stop me from coming back.
Ensenada ATX,8,I ve been craving a really good crispy fish or shrimp taco all summer and Ensenada delivered  Tried one of each and the batter is absolute perfection  so crispy. Everything tastes super fresh and the salsa was just right. Loved the limonada as well  I may have to make this a weekly thing because I know I m not going to be able to stop thinking about those tacos. Service was excellent too 
Ensenada ATX,9,Are you kidding me       Lawd this is some good food   This is my second time in a week... just dropped my kiddo off at the airport and it took two seconds to get here   So they basically have two things during the week... shrimp or fish tacos  and believe me  that s all ya need   They have this magical light crisp fried coating that s just perfect for the delicate seafood  and they fix it up just right. There s plenty of bottled sauces if you wanna get xtra spicy but I recommend springing for the  6 homemade salsa macha and you ll have some to take home and eat with eggs or on plain yogurt with chips. On the weekends they have shrimp cocktail and ceviche tostadas. The tostada was incredible but I wish they sold tiny containers of the macha for a buck cause I missed it on my shrimp taco   But the Perrona Negra was perfect and I m buying some of that on Amazon   Yay   Oh  little side note... grab some soul food at Watt s That next door   Mr. Watts cooks the best pork chops  Turkey legs and red beans EVER   So yeah... get here   It s in E. MLK just east of Chestnut and Chicon
Ensenada ATX,10,No line yet an insanely long wait for the tacos. Overpriced and bad presentation. Will not return.
Ensenada ATX,11,Finally after 25 years in Austin  there s a great Ensenada style fish and shrimp taco truck   We tried both and they were delicious as well as the tortillas.  Not to be missed for dessert is the chocolate brownies made with fruit inside. We tried the pineapple as the other 2 flavors were already sold out   This is a mother  amp  daughter business with the best customer service. The daughter is only 9 and is already a tock star saleswoman that many could learn from. Can t wait to return 
Ensenada ATX,12,Truly the best Baja style tacos in Austin  hands down. Don t sleep on the salsa macha either. The three generations of women running the food truck are tremendous  New favorite neighborhood spot.
Ensenada ATX,13,Best baja style fish taco that I have ever tasted. These ladies have something legit  So glad Austin has this now.
Ensenada ATX,14,These are the best fish tacos outside of Mexico   I would highly recommend everyone in the Austin area and visiting Austin to take the time to eat at Ensenada ATX.
Ensenada ATX,15,Amazing the best fish tacos I ve every outside of socal or Mexico holy smokes these things are addictive I will be living here for my lunch breaks     Amaaaaazing
Ensenada ATX,16,Stephanie and her mom Liz and family were the absolute nicest. Only thing better was that the tacos were amazing   Been looking for a Baja style fish taco in town since RosaritoATX disappeared and this is definitely it. Cannot see this spot not blowing up and wishing them the best of luck. Also the brownies were great too.
Always Hungry,1,This place is amazing  Such a thoughtful menu and so many really great flavors put together in each dish. You have to get at least one sweet and at least one savory taquito. I had 3. Black bean  Bison  and Almond Butter. I wish I had 6   My main was the pulled jackfruit bowl. First time I ve eaten jackfruit. Whatever sauce it was in. Next level.   This truck can cater to every diet you could think of. Vegan  keto  pescatarian  omnivore. All of it. If you go to or even near Spider House. Eat at Always Hungry
Always Hungry,2,Always Hungry stopped in after work  so I decided to give them a try since they were one of the newer food trucks that I haven t had a chance to eat at yet. I ordered the bison power bowl. The wait time was a bit longer than I had expected. My bowl was a bit on the lighter side and I would have liked to get more seasoning on the protein. Overall it was an average experience
Always Hungry,3,Love good food   Tried this place it was in our neighborhood Blanco Vista  it really hit the spot  Chicken sliders delicious chicken tacos excellent tuna sliders and taco excellent   high quality well done food   at first I thought the tacos looked small  got them to go  but they were very filling and very delicious. One of the best tacos i ve had in some time. Santa B rbara style
Always Hungry,4,What a treat  Had the bison tacos at Always Hungry today. Those come with almond flour tortillas and they also let me try the beet  and the green machine tortillas. Delicious food  great service and some really fantastic guys running the whole thing. Check them out at Spiderhouse Ballroom   keepaustineatin  austin360eats  austinfoodstagram  atxeats  austinfoodblogger
Always Hungry,5,I tried everything vegan on the menu and it was all very cool.  Gluten free almond tortillas and plant based tamales and chili.  There are no bad meals here.
Always Hungry,6,The food was so good  and equally as important  the people working were so nice. I do wish they offered more taco bundle type of deals as they aren t the cheapest  but I would definitely go again. I had the mushroom and jackfruit tacos and they both were great veg options.
Always Hungry,7,I had the Bison Tacos which were excellent  My sister has the Jackfruit Tacos all the time and loves them. The service was excellent. Wonderful experience and highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a light  healthy  and adventurous meal  I ate them to fast to take a picture as I was driving home from Austin 
Always Hungry,8,Interesting and original menu. I got the ahi tuna tacos made with almond flour. I had 3 small tacos made but really filling and so fresh and healthy   I liked the area  it is right next to Spider House so you get the nice ambiance but at the same time some quiet. The staff is also awesome   Can t wait to come back there    
Always Hungry,9,I just had the most amazing  gluten-free awesome tasting pizza pie ever  It is called the  planet pie  and if you haven t tried it  you simply must  These guys strive to create healthy  inspiring dishes that will not only cure your hungry appetite  but will leave you with a  zest for life that you never before knew that you had.
Always Hungry,10,This food truck is my favorite guilt-free pleasure  Every dish is Insta-worthy  not to mention healthy AND delicious. I m allowed to say that because I ve tried them all    Jason and Shelby have crafted every ingredient that goes into these dishes with your health in mind. I highly recommend the salmon tacos and burger. They offer vegan  vegetarian  pescatarian  amp  gluten-free options so there s something for everyone. The meal leaves you energized and satisfied  not sluggish and slow. Finally  a  fast  food that is healthy and nourishes my body 
Always Hungry,11,I was in doubt as to how great vegan food would be but the food was stellar. The service was great and the owner came out and talked with me for 10 minutes. Loved the place and will be back 
Always Hungry,12,Delightfully fresh and very tasty GF and vegan veg optional food. Love the mushroom bowl and garbanzo ceviche. I lll be back 
Always Hungry,13,I m Celiac And it s very hard to find good restaurants that s all gluten and dairy free. My husband and I just had lunch here and it was really good food and really good staff and the owner is very nice. I totally recommend this place
Always Hungry,14,I just ate a suspiciously delicious creation from Always Hungry and am left wondering what kind of deal with the devil Shelby had to make to be able to produce such a masterpiece.  I had the plant pizza. Being a voracious carnivore  I was skeptical that lunch could be enjoyable without something having to die but after lunch at Always Hungry  I find myself immensely satisfied and surprisingly void of a desire for a nap. This wasn t my first attempt at a glutenless  vegan meal however it was the first time I ve had such a meal that didn t taste like the stationary aisle at Office Depot. On top of the killer meal  Shelby epitomized what it means to be a southern gentleman  bringing our lunch directly to us and removing his hat when greeting my mother. Cherry on top  But of course. Our lunch came out with a personalized note of appreciation authored by the same hands that made it. I don t always eat vegan  but when I do  I demand Always Hungry. Thanks Shelby  color me impressed.
Always Hungry,15,Shelby is a great guy and he coooks up some great food  I had the Bison tacos and I d 100  recommend them to anyone who enjoys light  fresh  and flavorful bundles of love in their mouths. Will be back asap 
Always Hungry,16,I m obsessed    I usually am a plane Jane and I hate like all sauces...  But theirs..  I can t get enough and the tortillas are probably my favorite tortillas in the world. The whole thing is just amazing and so pretty
Always Hungry,17,Nice place tucked away in the corner of the Spiderhouse back patio. The Bison was probably the best gluten free tacos I ve had  had consistency and flavor. I ll be back for sure
Always Hungry,18,My friend Jason shared this vision with me a long time ago. Today I got to see it in person. I waited far too long because as soon as I took that first bite  i realized the mistake. Atmosphere is amazing and Shelby and Jason bring a delicious spin to quality  healthy food that doesn t weigh you down or give you a food coma  but rather fills you up in a very clean healthy way Highly recommend almond butter berry but also had the ahi tuna. Both were ridiculously good. If you re reading this stop wasting you re time and go now 
Always Hungry,19,Best vegan tacos I ve ever had  you can taste the love it s prepared with  They make everything from scratch and incorporate so many flavots  leaving you feeling not only full  but nourished. Support this business 
Always Hungry,20,This food truck is a game changer  Everything is made fresh from scratch  like their almond flour tortillas and pizza crust  There is something for everyone whether their vegan or not. They are also located at Spider House  so the vibe is so laid back and relaxing. Definitely check them out 
Always Hungry,21,So good  Over the course of 3 days  my husband and I ate here twice. We even brought a friend of ours here. I made my own bowl between the 2 vegetable ones. My husband had one of their meat bowls. Everything tasted very fresh. The first night we ate there  we heard a great musician  which made for a really nice atmosphere . The guys who run the truck are really friendly and nice. The food is delicious.
Veracruz All Natural,1,4 5 Love the breakfast tacos here   I love the Migas Poblanas  breakfast taco with avocado  egg and poblano peppers   and micas originales. Each taco was about  5 dollars and for 4 tacos about  24 total.  The lunch tacos  the grilled chicken and grilled steak were disappointing  The meat is dry and tacos lack flavor.   Best part about the tacos  is the orange sauce salsa which is this dry heat sauce that has chipotle flavor. The ordering process was pretty fast  you walk up to the window and self order on an iPad. You can put in your phone number and they will text you when the order is ready. For me on a busy weekend took about 10 minutes to get my order. I love the truck area as well because there are a lot of places to sit aaround the park to enjoy a sunny Sunday morning 
Veracruz All Natural,2,Been to Cesar Chavez location several times and to the now-closed brick and mortar cafe off 183 once. I was never disappointed. I was pleased again with the Mueller truck today.   Their quest continues to be excellent  rich  gooey and spicy enough and addictive. I had the El Tradicional breakfast taco  a straight-down-the-middle taco with egg  bacon  cheese on a flour tortilla. Extremely well executed. All the ingredients are top shelf. Not very spicey but a dollop of their red sauce cures that. All in our party were well-pleased. The food came out more quickly  probably because they weren t very busy mid morning on a Thursday.   There is also a good coffee truck right next door  so it made for an excellent brunch experience
Veracruz All Natural,3,It pains me to say this  but Veracruz has been on a downward trend in the recent past and today s experience was the final straw.  I recommended Veracruz to my out-of-town friend and he picked up a few tacos for our lunch. There were three issues.   1  There was no one on line when he arrived  yet when he picked up his order  it did not come with any salsa and no one form the trailer told him where he could get any--even though they had no other customers to worry about.  2  he ordered migas and I El Differente  but the trailer had wrapped the El Differente with a  Migas Originales  wrapper. Since this was my friend s first time at Veracruz  polished off half of the El Differente before I pointed out that they had mixed up the wrappers. Again  there were no other customers to worry about  so mixing up the wrappers made no sense.  3  After we swapped tacos  he bit into the migas and hit a massive vein of salt  it not have bene blended in properly during cooking. It made the rest of the taco inedible. Again  there were no other customers to worry about  so why the inattentive cooking   These miscues were bad and my friend has questioned why people are so hyped about Veracruz. But it s part a downward trend in my past several visits at Veracruz  where even after a  1 hike on every taco earlier this year because of inflation  the quality has not been what it used to be. Add to it the decline in service and Veracruz is now looking like a pretty bad value proposition.  It s nothing like the Veracruz I first remembered from many years ago  when I first had it at Radio during my first trip to Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,4,Longest wait ever for tacos...  My gf and I waited for an hour and a half for these tacos. We weren t waiting in line that long  it just takes them FOREVER to complete orders. They have a sign that says 30-40min wait  but that was extremely underestimated.  We had a booked activity after breakfast and were over 30mins late because we wanted to wait for our food. Kept thinking we were so close to the allotted wait time but then kept waiting way past it. We tried asking them about how many orders away were we  and they said 5mins which turned into 20.  There were times that people went to the truck asking for an order  and they were like  oh yeah  here  and it was ready  but just inside the truck still in their bags.  I love the diversity of ingredients in their menu  but it s clear they have a terrible workflow to deliver on it while in a food truck. It s ridiculous how bad their service is.  With all that said  their tacos are freaking delicious. It s filled with so many ingredients  it s basically a burrito. I got the Al Pastor and Migas Originales tacos. I liked both a lot but I wish the Al Pastor had more pineapple in it. Migas taco was my favorite.  I would go to one of their other locations instead. Hopefully the ones with a kitchen or a different staff works quicker...  I didn t even have time to take pics of our food because I hd to eat while driving and rushing to our scheduled event 
Veracruz All Natural,5,We arrived early in the morning   9 am  and ordered via the touch screen outside of the food truck. We were informed that there will be a 30 minute wait  which was pretty odd because there weren t a lot of people waiting or a long line at all .   Anyway  the tacos were pretty pricey   4  per taco . Best Fish Taco I ve had in quite some time  Grilled tilapia  cabbage  mango pico  Monterey Jack cheese  avocado  chipotle mayo salsa. Choose in-house homemade corn tortillas or locally made flour tortillas   but for   6 per tacos after tax  it is on the steep side. The Steak Taco was okay  but nothing to rave about  Beef  cilantro  onion  Queso fresco  and avocado. Choose in-house homemade corn tortillas or locally made flour tortillas . For  5.25  I ve had better steak tacos for less.  The food truck shares outdoor seating with other establishments around the area  there was an ice cream truck  cupcakes truck  a salad truck  and coffee truck .  Lots of random austin birds flying around looking for food as you re eating 
Veracruz All Natural,6,Woah buddy.  These are some serious tacos.  One thing that Austin does very well is tacos. And in 6 months here these might be my favorite.  The Migas taco is NEXT LEVEL delicious. I m no a vegetarian but that poblano situation is on point  I came here several time and each time was consistently delicious.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND
Veracruz All Natural,7,Not to sound too annoyingly  old Austin   but I ve been going to Veracruz All Natural for WELL over a decade  since it was one tiny  hidden little gem of a taco trailer on Caesar Chavez.  This place used to be untouchable. Just the best damn tacos in town  and probably the state if we re being honest.   Which is why my experience on Tuesday was so profoundly disappointing.   I m visiting my hometown from overseas  chasing the dragon of a memory of amazing tacos...so we head here for lunch.   My husband ordered and his foreign card didn t work. He offered cash with exact change. They didn t give him an order number or take his name.   Then we wait. Hell  I don t mind waiting for the best  really. But we wait a LONG time. After 30 minutes he checks on our order. They say  we re working on it.    45 minutes. We watch people who came 15  20 minutes after us get their food. Eat Their food. Leave.   He checks again.  We re working on it   they say. After almost an hour  they put out our 4 tacos  complete with a hand written order ticket  then promptly close up.   Our tacos are all on flour tortillas. I fucking hate flour tortillas. One of the things I used to love about Veracruz were the incredible corn tortillas they used.   We are literally the very last people left. The sun has completely changed positions. Our tacos are mediocre at best.   Listen  if your employees want to pocket  20 in cash at the end of a shift  fine. That s their business. They could at least have the decency to serve their half added tacos in a reasonable amount of time.   Photo of my handwritten ticket attached for proof and posterity.   Heartbreaking to see one of the best turn into a just so-so place to get an overhyped taco in a town whose middle name is Taco. Sad 
Veracruz All Natural,8,Veracruz is my favorite breakfast taco and barbacoa spot in Austin  They have a food truck on Webberville next to Doughminican and cute pop-up events weekly. We were turned onto this spot when they opened up at the Line hotel downtown by a friend with multiple food allergies  soy  gluten and dairy . Veracruz has been one of the best spots who have been able to accommodate her eating restrictions without sacrificing taste and quality.   I usually get barbacoa  el traditional  grilled fish or the chorizo breakfast taco. We also love their green salsa and molcajete 
Veracruz All Natural,9,A marvel and a jewel. They make their own corn tortillas and chips. The best shrimp tacos I ve ever had... amp  I m not a shrimp guy. The vegan queso is a revelation. My only suggestion  they use canola oil  which is neither Mexican  only from Canada  nor natural  rapeseed oil is only edible via chemical treatment . But I love these folks  amp  their places 
Veracruz All Natural,10,Food was good  But couldn t give five stars because they forgot one of my tacos and I made double sure that I didn t just leave it in the bag or give it to one of my family members by accident. I went back up to let them know and the first thing they said was no I definitely remember putting it in your bag.   Feeling dumb  I went back to triple check and of course we counted the tacos again and we were still missing one so I had to go back up and one of the employees said that she accidentally put it in the wrong bag.   Glad that we eventually got it sorted out but thinking that I was the one who made a mistake even though I made double sure first made me lose my appetite. Would still recommend the place but please be more careful next time Veracruz 
Veracruz All Natural,11,I don t understand why my notes on order online were completely ignored. I specifically asked to have salsa on the side with my tacos. But my to-go tacos were completely without salsa in the bag.  I didn t get to check the bag before going home unfortunately.  Tacos without salsa are just utter disappointment. This was the second time they did this. I thought the first was just a mistake  but now that I know they re consistently amiss  gonna be checking the bags.
Veracruz All Natural,12,I ve been to the original and it was awesome. This location is similarly awesome. These are superior breakfast tacos. I think right now you have to order online  which is not such a bad thing because they re not the fastest. So the play is to order online before you leave your house and by the time you get there it ll probably be ready.
Veracruz All Natural,13,I ve loved this spot in the past  but we were left waiting well over an hour for an order of 4 tacos on a slow day  as you can see in the picture  there is no line . There were four people  working  in the truck  so I can t imagine what could justify a wait like this and I won t be back again until they ve resolved the issue.
Veracruz All Natural,14,These are the best tacos from a food truck you will find  Insanely flavorful and bountiful in portion size. Salsas are excellent and service is great. Can t beat this amazing place. Wish there was one closer to where I live  This place is worth the trek 
Veracruz All Natural,15,First time back since 3 weeks ago  and I tried to preorder online but they closed online ordering and only accepting orders in-person. I got 4 tacos and it took about 15 minutes.   I changed up my order this time - got the Shrimp Macha   my fave Migas Originales. Shrimp was SO GOOD but also SO SPICY  from the macha salsa    but at the same time  I love me a good spice. I think this will be my new fave combo to order.   My dad ordered a fish taco and loved how fresh the salsa was. Still doesn t fail to impress me 
Veracruz All Natural,16,Best tacos in Austin. Get migas on corn and snag the green sauce. Sometimes there s a wait and that s just life 
Veracruz All Natural,17,WOW  These tacos are amazing     I had heard so many amazing things about this place  I m so glad I finally got a chance to try it out.   I got the potato and egg taco - each bite was so delicious and the red and green sauces pair perfectly  The corn tortilla was soft and enveloped the filling.  I also got the La Reyna vegetarian taco - not as good as the potato and egg but still super yummy   The chips were also a nice and crunchy- paired with the taco really balanced the textures    Overall  The food truck is super great value and really covid friendly. I would highly recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,18,Love their quesadillas   I ve been to several of their locations and they are always consistently delicious. Don t forget to get the sand a aguas frescas too 
Veracruz All Natural,19,I waited a solid hour for a single taco. No one advised me or any of the other customers that orders were running an hour behind  so everyone there got burned. When my taco  barbacoa  finally did arrive  the meat looked and smelled like it came straight out of a room-temperature can of dog food. I don t know which was worse  their disgusting food or their dysfunctional system. Awful 
Veracruz All Natural,20,I am actually drooling a little bit just thinking back to these tacos. They were just so good.  Picked up two tacos for a quick lunch and they really hit the spot. I ordered the al pastor and the steak taco. So much flavor.  The al pastor was a little greasy  dripped a bit  but all is forgiven with the flavors it brought to my mouth. The pork was tender  juicy  and melted with each bite. A little bit of cilantro and onion were the perfect toppings along with a slightly spicy chipotle sauce. It had just the right amount of kick.  After eating the al pastor  I looked at the steak taco with some hesitation. It looked a little plain at this point. But like many times before  I was wrong. The steak was flavorful and juicy. A little bit of cilantro  a little bit of onion  throw in a slice of avocado and you have a winner.
Veracruz All Natural,21,Veracruz tacos are the always great. My favorites are the Migas. This location also has nice smoothies  I ordered spinach and peanut butter one  tasted really good.
Veracruz All Natural,22,Never particularly excited about eggs as a taco filling but the migas poblanas are exceptional.
Veracruz All Natural,23,Top 2 taco spots in Austin. Quality tacos in a little food truck park. Good vibes after a long day after being in the sun. Can t come to Austin without stopping by to have these 
Veracruz All Natural,24,Very poor customer service don t waste your time.  Not friendly at all if you have questions.  They need to have someone who cares at the register.  Lady was very unpleasant.  Very unsatisfied customer.  Will never stop by. Not worth it.
Veracruz All Natural,25,did not live tot he hype at all and they automatically add a 19  gratuity without consent   got the barbacoa which was pretty flavorless 2 5
Veracruz All Natural,26,I am now a big fan and this currently my  1 favorite taco place. I came by today for a couple of lunch tacos. I had the barbacoa and fish taco  but I think I might have had one of family member s migas instead. The tacos were not marked. Whatever it was I had  either fish taco or migas  it was soooo yum.   Their red salsa is to die for. It s hot  spicy  smokey  and very flavorful. I had to stop myself from just downing all of the red salsa with chips 
Veracruz All Natural,27,This was THE place I was most excited to try in Austin  and it lived ip to the hype. There s a wait most days  but well worth it. My Migas taco was the star of the show  with fresh avocado  crushed tortilla chips  eggs  and cheesy goodness  The red salsa was like fire in the best way  but I loved the green guaca-salsa on everything with its slight spice and creaminess. The tortillas gave a good crunch to the taco  which made it all the better. Try it while you re here 
Veracruz All Natural,28,I have heard so many great things about this place so I really wanted to like it. I had a migas poblanos and El Sancho breakfast tacos on flour tortillas. Flour tortillas are amazing  good size taco with the right amount of filling. The migas poblanos were bland  crispy tortilla chips  cheese wasn t delivering but it wasn t bad. The sancho was possibly the worst chorizo taco I ve ever had. The chorizo was spongy and didn t have any spice flavors  not fatty or greasy or flavorful. Taco was sooo bland  eggs were way over cooked and cheese lacked flavor but smelled like wet dog. Salsa verde lacked salt and flavor but it was okay. Red salsa tasted like sesame oil  lacked in flavor and was spicy but not in a good way. It was the type of spicy that didn t have any flavor  just coated your tongue in an uncomfortable feeling while not improving the food. When they say 40-50 minute wait  they mean it. Don t think it will be faster because your order is small or it seems slow. I don t hold that against them  because my food was ready when they said it would be  but just a warning that the wait is long. Service was okay  nothing special. Overall disappointing
Veracruz All Natural,29,Stopped by after my trip to the farmers market on Mueller. These are definitely one of the best tacos in Austin.   Each taco order comes with one taco. BUT  these tacos are super delicious and filling. I got the pastor taco and my sister the el tradicional. The pastor taco was flavorful  moist  tender  but when you add that green salsa  trust me when I say you re going to crave that taco the very next day.   It s a bit of a wait  but definitely worth it 
Veracruz All Natural,30,Stuffed tacos with some very tasty fillings  The fish and pastor were pretty tasty. The breakfast taco was standard but very sizable. All in all  solid taco food truck.
Veracruz All Natural,31,Overview  Solid taco place in Austin  I got the Migas original and Tradicional tacos-- both were excellent and full of all the good stuff. Veracruz was situated in an area with some other food trucks  so you had options-- I paired my tacos with some coffee at a nearby coffee truck.   Service  Nothing out of the ordinary  nothing terrible about it. I waited about 5-10 minutes for my tacos  and the sauces are self service  so you can have as much as you want   Atmosphere  Came here on a cold  windy drizzly day  so my friends and I decided to eat underneath a covered area nearby.   Food  Good tacos  and I will definitely come back  Only reason why I m giving Veracruz 4 stars is because I ve had better tacos elsewhere. Solid all around.
Veracruz All Natural,32,Waited twice as long than stated. My wife and I and six month baby came here based on reviews. We asked how long the wait was and they said 30min. I m currently standing here waiting and it has been over an hour. The folks there said sorry they are working as fast as they can but honestly if you look at their pace  they are not rushing to get the orders done. Next time give a more realistic wait time rather than trick customers into waiting much much longer. Honestly matters.
Veracruz All Natural,33,These were the best breakfast tacos I ve had. They are hearty portions with great flavors and fresh ingredients. My husband had a quesadilla that came with lots of sides and was crispy and delicious. We did wait 40 minutes on a slow Friday morning  so I would suggest ordering ahead via online or phone if you can. But it was absolutely worth the wait. Best flavors we had during our time in Austin.
Veracruz All Natural,34,I first found out about Veracruz by a friend that raves about it to me. I was going to wait for her to visit before I tried it but I just couldn t resist. I ordered two breakfast tacos  Egg and potato and El Tradicional  and they definitely lived up to expectations . They are currently taking all orders online with pickup right outside their food truck. The only issue that I had was the over hour long wait time for my food. To be fair I came on a Saturday at 11 AM which is prime brunch time  but I still feel like the wait time was a little long. Luckily I got a smoothie from one of the food trucks nearby and went on a walk until my food was ready.
Veracruz All Natural,35,Can t believe we hadn t been here before  way better than I expected. There are tons of breakfast tacos in austin and these held their own  I like their green salsa more then taco delis. The online ordering was easy  I think it defaults to you having to wait 30 minutes because we ordered at a random time on a weekday and we re hoping it would be more like 10-15 minutes  But worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,36,Maybe don t let people set literally any time for pickup on their order so they don t all select the same time and have to wait an hour after their requested time to be able to eat  At any other restaurant you can get your food within 5 minutes of ordering.   Ordering here is not worth it until they fix this issue. Eat elsewhere during these Covid unless you have plenty of free time.  The food comes out super hot. This may be a con for some but I think it was fine. The food otherwise is good  but diminished because of the frustration of having wait longer than expected.
Veracruz All Natural,37,Tacos a little small  but these are the best in town. Really top notch tortillas and vegetarian options. Breakfast tacos galore. Must get is migas  but also gotta get anything with cheese since it s baked on and makes each bite worth it. About  3.50 for a taco so make it a full meal and get 3 and come out satisfied. Sauces spicy but not too spicy. Red sauce your typical and green sauce had a spiced avocado taste.
Veracruz All Natural,38,Tacos are delicious    Saturday mornings can be a bit busy but if you re willing to wait  you ll be rewarded    Al pastor  migas  and the fish we re the best 
Veracruz All Natural,39,At Veracruz All Natural  it is all about the corn tortilla. Don t get me wrong  the taco fillings are delicious too  But my favorite part is the taste of the tortilla. Also  I love that this location is easily accessible for those in the Mueller area  amp  has an adjacent free parking lot. They have several locations across Austin  but ever since this food truck opened by the hangar  it s hard for me to consider going elsewhere.  Although I haven t had a chance to sample every taco yet  a few are in my regular rotation  Al Pastor  Fish   amp  El Sancho. It really just depends on your mood though - everything I ve tried so far is good. Top it off with your favorite salsa  I m all about the green   and you are set.
Veracruz All Natural,40,Veracruz has the best migas in town  Their tacos are absolutely huge and packed with flavor. Minus one star because they got rid of their self serve salsas and the two remaining salsa s are too spicy for me. If they bring back the milder  chunky salsa  it s definitely a  review from me 
Veracruz All Natural,41,Simply incredible. You know they re doing something right when they are able to make a chorizo  egg  and cheese taco  El Sancho  stand out. This is one of my favorite types of taco and I order it everywhere and pretty much everyone has an equally delicious version of it and yet just when you think you ve experienced the full range of a dish  Veracruz somehow creates and even better version.  Not to mention they have not one but two versions of migas  And  to top it all off  they have dank salsa with avocado chunks in it.  I ve been a half-dozen times and still haven t managed to order anything other than chorizo or migas because they are so good that I m afraid nothing else could surpass them. Perhaps one day I ll be brave enough to try the rest of the menu.
Veracruz All Natural,42,What s not to like  The latest installment of the Veracruz All Natural food truck is in Mueller next to the Browning Hanger. They re serving up delicious tacos for  3-4 including the spicy  El Sancho  chorizo taco and their hearty migas breakfast taco. Be sure to get some of the spicy green sauce.   This location does not have the juice bar offerings of the other food trucks.
Veracruz All Natural,43,Just waited 40 minutes to get our order...get home and its wrong     The tacos are good but not that good. DO BETTER  This system is horrible. To wait so long for 4 tacos is crazy and then on top of that  for the order to be wrong is just unacceptable. Sad bc we really want to support this place. Especially now.
Veracruz All Natural,44,I first had Veracruz when they had a location on East Cesar Chavez. It was the first place I ever ate in Austin and I liked it quite a bit. Fast forward to the present day and the food is pretty good but the ordering system is a pretty big let down. I  was out running errands and in an effort to get something fresh and fast  Veracruz jumped to the front of my mind. I located this location rather easily and headed right over. It was a bit out of my way  but I didn t mind  remembering how quick they had been in the past. I parked  hopped out the car and walked over to the truck. The signs were a plenty and somewhat confusing  but I figured out that I was required to order online  even if I was standing directly in front of the truck. If that s not accurate  refer back to my previous statement regarding the signage. I was hungry and at the location  so I ordered the original migas and the vegetarian option. I ended up preferring the veggie option with poblano peppers. The tacos were good  but not spectacular. I guess I might not be that big of a fan of migas. Both hot sauces were fine  as well. The orange option was quite a bit spicier  but also thicker than the green option. I dropped the review to three stars based largely on the ordering system and the fact that I would need to go online to get extra salsa  even after receiving my food. I understand the issues of COVID and serving food better than most  but having zero interaction doesn t make for a great business model.  Perhaps try and communicate the ordering situation more effectively online.  LONG STORY SHORT  Food is good  no service to review. Be prepared to wait 20 mins if you haven t ordered before arriving. I can t speak for the other locations.
Veracruz All Natural,45,Orders regularly take 2  hours  short staffed and will run out of things  pick another location
Veracruz All Natural,46,Don t go here. At least not when I m about to get in line. It s long enough already. Seriously though  this taco truck is bomb as fuck.  Yo this dude Andrew actually knocked this place because of BIRDS  Dude  it s outside. Birds live there.  I hope he gets pooed on.
Veracruz All Natural,47,Ordered the Migas  chicken  and Pastor tacos. All were great  but the Pastor was amazing.  Convenient place for breakfast. Location was clean.
Veracruz All Natural,48,Seriously  I ve been getting Veracruz tacos for 5  years. First time at this location. Ordered 5 tacos in total  4 of them were messed up  missing toppings . Come on. Receipt had it listed correctly  not an ordering issue.
Veracruz All Natural,49,I am so bummed I ve lived in Austin for 2 years now and kept hearing to try this place and I m just now doing it  Honestly the best breakfast tacos I ve had around here  and their salsa is so good too  I personally like salsa verde better but the red was still good. Having a truck where I run every morning is going to be dangerous for me.
Veracruz All Natural,50,Always incredible  amp  they deserve much success. Don t sleep on the fish taco 
Veracruz All Natural,51,These are some of my favorite tacos in town. They make their own corn tortillas and it shows. This would be a 5 star rating if food were the only consideration. However at the food truck park in Mueller  there are two major problems that are enough to keep me away from coming here a lot more.    1  disgusting tables. I realize it s a community table situation similar to most food truck parks. But these tables are coated in dirt and bird poop. The salt in the wound is that Veracruz sets up their payment terminal with preset tip amounts. The least option is 15   so I would suggest that if they are going to sell  3- 5 counter service tacos  maybe they should wander out of the trailer from time to time and wipe the tables down to give their clientele a place to enjoy them.    2  the next thing is the birds. Maybe nothing can be done  but it seems like somebody should be trying to do something. They are a real nuisance. You literally have to guard your food. I have only seen some seagulls on a beach once that were this aggressive with humans.   Anyway  love the tacos and salsa. At least wipe the tables down.
Veracruz All Natural,52,Coming in from Seattle we were craving perfect breakfast tacos. We found them  We had the traditional and the pablano migas tacos and they were both excellent. Follow it up with a cortado from Compas Coffee in the same food truck corral.
Veracruz All Natural,53,Okay I last minute stopped  in because I needed food and those were some of the best tacos I have ever had. The menu is small and almost completely vegan. I waS very impressed by the food  service  and the food truck area this was located in  I will most definitely be coming back  
Veracruz All Natural,54,Love this taco truck  It s my favorite along with the vegan nom. I love the el diferente  They have a couple other veggie options at the mueller location. Definitely stop for a taco if you re around 
Veracruz All Natural,55,I used to love getting Veracruz tacos when I lived down South. I am so happy that they have a truck in my neighborhood now. Their tacos taste very fresh and are delicious    I love the combo of classic and unique flavors. Also  not a vegetarian  but they make a super tasty veggie taco  you don t even miss the meat 
Veracruz All Natural,56,I love Veracruz. This muller location has been closed twice when yelp says it s open. Sad face. Change your hours Ms Vera  so I can stop crying and tantruming against your shuttered window.
Veracruz All Natural,57,This place is sooo good. Highly recommend the pastor tacos. There s soft bits and crunchy bits of pastor which makes this taco so enjoyable to eat. Lengua was another huge win with large pieces so you can taste the texture of this protein. Lastly  the carnitas  taco has a lot of meat. They give you a lot in that taco.
Veracruz All Natural,58,Great tacos  I got the Migas and Traditional. The Migas was fantastic  plus you can walk over to the adjacent food truck and get a coffee too  I would say  this would have been five stars had the truck not gotten my order wrong. I don t eat beans  and asked for my traditional with no beans  however  they messed it up and still included beans. Overall  it s a pretty good place with average pricing.
Veracruz All Natural,59,Since Veracruz has moved into mueller we have to try not to go there more than three times a week. Do they put msg and crack in their food  It s ridiculously tasty  my mouth is salivating as I type this thinking about their breakfast tacos. My fav is the poblanas because I don t like cheese but my kid is all about the migas originales. Sure sometimes there s a wait but I know it s because they re making everything from scratch. Worth the wait for good and fresh food. The people at the register are super friendly and they remember us  a nice touch .
Veracruz All Natural,60,I love this food truck. Thank you for being in Mueller. Breakfast and lunch - it is always fresh  great  and tasty 
Veracruz All Natural,61,I had the fish taco today for lunch and loved it  The homemade corn tortilla is so delicious  loads of fish and avocados. The only negative was no one gave me my water that I did ask for and did not realize I was charged a dollar for it until I got home to see the receipt online. Service is very iffy
Veracruz All Natural,62,Their breakfast tacos are amazing - some of my favorite in town. Very fresh ingredients  very tasty. Never a bad experience at this food truck. Their latest brick and mortar location is also equally great  maybe even better because of the tasty drinks and smoothies you can get there .
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,1,Love their yucca frita with chicharr n plate as well as their pupusas. Usually call ahead and just pick up my order  they always have it ready when I show up and check out is fast and easy.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,2,I met a girl from El Salvador. I told her she was El salvAdorable...  But she said she s heard that a Brazilian times.  You wanted to find out about pupusas that taste like they re from El Salvador  this is the place. I was shocked when I got home on how to see they were. This is the third place that I ve tried in town and my wife and I think that it is the best tasting one to this point. Customer service was good and as soon as I walked in they started to help me. The only reason that I didn t give them five stars is because the parking lot is very busy and there are people whipping in and out like crash derby drivers. It is hard to hold this against this business but it is a concern when you are coming to pick up some food.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,3,Mal servicio  Las mesera se Porto muy mal con mucha actitud able para ordenar y con mala gana me dieron las cosas la verdad es la ultimaves Que voy pesimo servicio al cliente.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,4,I love a good pork and cheese pupusa  and this spot can offer me what I need. We always call in our orders and enjoy pupusas at home. We ve only been here once but can guarantee we d come back. They were tasty on the first day and were great for a reheat the next.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,5,We came from Houston and was recommended to try there food . Food was okay but very expensive. Not only that the staff is very RUDE     the lady at the front was kicking out people once checking out . Not to mention the can sodas are 4      
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,6,If you re looking for authentic food   This place is where it s at. Love their Salvadorian dishes and Mexican dishes. We always order pupasas with any of our entrees  The cole slaw is bomb too  I just wished they had watermelon aqua fresas.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,7,Love Salvadoran comfort food  the tamales  frijoles fritos  crema  etc. This is a good GO to spot  I give 4 stars because pupusas could be better but still far away from home  it reminds me of my  domingdepupusas
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,8,Omg I m not a fish person but it was delicious so recommend  I have a really hard time with flavor but it was very delicious
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,9,I just love this place   Very friendly   not fancy at all. Prices are very affordable and staff is always smiling and explaining the best they can about their menu.  Pupusas  tamales and my favorite   sopa de mondongo   is made to perfection   I travel a lot and always looking for my Salvadorean fix and Yes   This is the place
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,10,Wow     At last  I found a legitimate Honduran Tex Mex spot   Holy cow. I was afraid that moving to Austin would be the end of my taqueria days  but I am wrong    I ordered a to-go order. I got 2 pupusas de frijol y queso  bean and cheese . The best part is that the cheese is a great quality white cheese that just tastes like home. It really tastes as though I m eating my grandmas cooking.   Omg and the salsa  Shoooot. It s so authentic and definitely homemade. This brown girl smiled until the last bite.   I definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for AUTHENTIC Honduran food.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,11,Very authentic.  Everything made to order so hope you re not in a hurry. Staff very pleasant. Area it s located in is kind of scary. Salsa is the BEST. However food is like eating a brick of salt. I could not eat the rice or beans.   2 stars for the salsa and staff.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,12,It s always a treat to eat here after being picked up from the airport.  The best pupusas in Austin  TX.  Being half Salvadoran  I know what I m talking about.  I got the revuelta  mixed  one with a side of beans and scrambled eggs. Make sure to put the sauces on top of the pupusa. It s tradition  My family also ordered a side of platanos. Get the cream 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,13,I have been looking for a closer to North Austin  location for pupusas  and fried plantains.  usually hit up El Sunzal  We had two breakfast dishes  4 pupusas  and shared a mexican coke. Was about 23 and some change.   I love the hole in the wall Mom  amp  Pop places. Because damn these Loroco and Cheese Pupusas are delicious AF. The cabage comes with tongs  and the tomato sauce is SO YUMMY.  The migas were covered in cheese and chopped jalepenos  with a side of beans and crisp edged potatoes. The chips had a good bite and slightly soggy from the cheese. They were great. I would highly recommend this place. It s small  but the food is what you come for. Waitress was real nice  and took our order and only asked us once about the food  Which had no complaints  and appreciated being able to eat without questions   p    I definitely can t wait to go back 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,14,These pupusas are among the best in town   I m Salvadoran and I m happy with these.   I got them with three ingredients -- chicharr n  beans  and cheese. Next time I ll get a couple with just beans and cheese because the cheese is so good.   You can order in English or Spanish.   My only trouble is that with to go orders  it can get a little messy. Make sure not to tip over your curtido bag  and that it s always zipped shut.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,15,Not acceptable  Walked in and waited without being at least greeted for five minutes. Two ladies behind the counter standing around and one server chatting away two tables down. Your loss folks  My business  never again coming your way.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,16,Really good place  Pupusas are amazing  grate place to eat but it will take time to get attended and get the food on the table. The workers should show a little more of a smile but the food really makes up for it.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,17,This place is hit and miss. Fortunately  it s pretty much hit for the Salvadoran part of the menu. The pupusas are outstanding. I especially like the ones with cheese and loroco. So we should keep returning for those. I hope they stay around.  When we stray towards the Mexican side of the menu  things soften. Literally. Their tamales were quite....mushy. I guess that s the word. I ordered Chicken tamales and what I got was this mess of masa and potato. Almost no chicken. When I complained about the lack of chicken  the waitress had the nerve to pick up my fork and poke at the tiny shreds of chicken in there. Good grief. Well  that s just one bad tale to tell.  On another occasion  I had ordered about 20 tacos to-go for a bunch of volunteers. They came out in a styrofoam box  NOT individually wrapped. When I explained to the waitress that I can t take and serve them like this  she proceeded to hand me a bunch of wax paper. I think someone in the kitchen thought better of it and took the box back to wrap them for me. The carnitas was amazingly tasty  all said and done. And I got what I needed. Clash of expectations.  So  what does this tell me  I don t know. Draw your own conclusions. It s a mixed bag experience. The service is slow  and sometimes rude  but possibly because everything is made fresh. So stick to the Salvadoran portion of the menu  drop your sense of entitlement  and you ll eat very well  you damn snowflakes.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,18,The pupusas are soooo good  Coming from Miami I have not been able to find decent ones in Austin until now. Definitely worth a try  and so is the fried yucca plate that comes with fried pork.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,19,Great food right around the corner  Mariscada  shellfish stew   bean and cheese papusas  plantains and fried yuca. So much flavor for so little price  Perfect for 2 people. Fish stew also had large pieces of white fish. Get with tortillas and add fermented cabbage relish  Yum 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,20,NOT LBGTQ  FRIENDLY  a friend went with their partner and the establishment was overtly not welcoming. They purposely took forever to help them and then eventually the cashier actually asked the other employee to switch with her so as not to interact with them. My friend and her partner were both very uncomfortable and it completely ruined their experience. Personal beliefs aside  everyone deserves to be treated like a human being. And why make an effort to turn away business. Money is money. Also  this is 2018 in Austin  TX. Get caught up with what s going on here or set up business somewhere else. There are other Salvadoran spots in Austin. Go to them.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,21,Straightforward  no nonsense Salvadoran fare.  Bring a friend and split the  combinated Salvadoran plate  to avoid full-on pupusa-induced coma.    Pupusas are delicious - tasty corn pockets filled with chicharr n y queso and loroco  a savory green herb  y queso.  They serve curtido  fermented cabbage slaw  in a huge plastic jug for you to scoop out yourself -- use liberally a top your pupusas as it helps cut the grease and makes you feel like you re eating some super health food since it s fermented after all.  Don t forget the pl tanos with black beans and crema.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,22,Hole in the wall type of place with authentic delicious food. I don t believe they have ac.. Part of the Salvador Mexico feel  Their Salvadorian combo plate was delicious. If you order an horchata and are used to the white horchata you may be surprised to get a dark murky looking horchata  but still tastes good. Overall  it s a good little spot with authentic food   amp  good price.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,23,LOVE the pupusas at this place  I love eating here every single time I come here. I don t really know of many other restaurants in the area that serve delicious pupusas like this place. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to eat some awesome pupusas  I ve never had anything else here .
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,24,This rating is strictly in regards to their Salvadorian food. Me and my family drive from Killeen to Austin twice sometimes three times a month just to eat the Pupusas  Pl tanos  and fried Yuca con chicharrones is authentic as you can get  without flying to El Salvador.  I  would recommend to anyone looking for this type of food.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,25,Such good pupusas i come here often and its really great food. The otole de elote is so good a must  
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,26,I really wanted to love this place. I am all about family owned businesses and little mom and pop restaurants that really are authentic to their heritage and culture  but this place didn t do it for me. It is really really small inside and no matter where you sit you feel crammed in. There are cheap posters and decor and no free refills  which always sucks .   I ordered the enchiladas with rice and beans. I really liked the rice and the beans. My enchiladas weren t good. Even my boyfriend  who is normally a garbage disposal and eats everything  didn t like it.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,27,Love the pupusas and pl tanos here and would recommend trying pupusas with the curtido salad and salsa to get the authentic experience...  Yummy  yummy.   I also tried the tamales and would not recommend that.  The service is good and be warned this is a hole in the wall type of place so bring your appetite and don t expect a view.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,28,This place rules.  I spent a good portion of my adult life thus far in Langley Park  MD  right on the outskirts of DC. This place is known to be overwhelmingly populated by Salvadorenos   so I am no stranger to  and a HUGE fan of  pupusas. Seriously  what s not to like   Get the pupusas de loroco  an herb native to El Salvador  and at least one revuelta. The cortido  repollo  which I don t know how to spell lol  whatever you want to call it  is  authentic.  It doesn t have any extra spices in it like Michoacana  this is exactly the flavor you want on your pupusas. The pupusas are the perfect consistency  which I know may seem weird to write  but I hate when they come out soggy. The yuca frita was perfect and a great  though unhealthy  but hey  we re eating pupusas  here  sidedish.  To top it off  the customer service was great. I love when a restaurant understands that they need to build rapport with their customers. They are welcoming and appear genuinely grateful that you have chosen to eat at their establishment.  This place is wonderful  and I m probably going there today.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,29,Costa del Sol will do you right. The chips come out hot  which is a nice touch. The pupusas are the stuff pupusa dreams are made of. The tamales are everything Salvadoran tamales should be  with chickpeas in the chicken  potatoes in the pork  and so moist you can hardly wrangle the pieces onto your fork. If you get the combinated plate  they toss in a handful of meaty chicharrones  making me wish I d had them put in my pupusa as well. And a good selection of Central American beer at rock bottom prices to boot.  Most of the servers hablan un poquito ingl s  so bring a bilingual friend or accept that your menu modifications will likely be limited to what you can say. Not that you d need to modify anything on the menu anyway.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,30,Lil gem of a find   Cheap authentic South American food that makes me wanna sing like those mariachi bands... oh wait that s Mexican.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,31,Bean and cheese pupusas are deffinetly a delight  Platano maduro plate was sweeten to perfection just went along right with the sour cream and beans. The restaurant s appearance is not the greatest service is not the best.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,32,Just had the worst flautas in the world. The only thing I was told by the waitress is  that is how they make them here  I don t like them either  . No apology and no offer to change the food. I will not be going back.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,33,This is my favorite place to go eat some comida Salvadore a. They have a delicious variety of amazing foods and I just love the vibe and everything  Very delicious pupusas
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,34,I just started a job at one of the office buildings at 7901 Cameron  so naturally I was eager to check out the nearby restaurants. Costa del Sol seems to be about it in terms of walking distance  practically next door   so it was first on my list. I d read the reviews and was definitely curious  although I decided to play it safe my first time and go with some lunch tacos  chicken fajita and marinated pork  or  pastor  . At 2 bucks a pop  the price can t be beat  I m writing this review after having just scarfed them down  and I have to say  pretty delish    However  the service left a little something to be desired. I m going to give it a few more tries before I revise my review  since I got the feeling the girl at the register was new. That would explain why there was a big pile-up of customers at the register waiting to pay during the lunch rush. They also have this bizarre system where the credit card machine is not conveniently next to the register where any reasonable person would put it  but instead at the other end of the counter  so any transaction takes extra time for the employees to go dashing off to run the card.  Also  none of the tables had been bused when I walked in  which is always a bit of a turn-off  but again  I ll chalk that up to lunch-time rush. The food s good  and cheap  so that kinda trumps mediocre service. And like I said  I ll give it a few more tries and maybe revise my review if my first impression wasn t quite as positive as it could have been.   Next time  I m trying the pupusa  which so many reviewers seem to be raving about 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,35,Something s really gone wrong here.  We ve moved closer and so we ve gone three times in the past 6 weeks.  Each time it just wasn t good at all.  Nothing like before.  I don t know what s gone wrong  but just about everything we liked about this place has gone way downhill.  I don t think we ll be back.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,36,First  I was the only non native Spanish speaker in the place  which usually indicates  pretty authentic food. Unfortunately  I expected a little more from a four star yelp recommendation.   I had the pick three plate to try a number of things. The cheese and beans pupusa was decent and the highlight of the food although the plantains were also sweet and somewhat caramelized making them pretty good. I didn t like the tamale  it was filled with too much potato and chick pea and not enough pork.   Maybe I m used to getting really quick service at most Mexican restaurants  and salvadoran good is slower   but the service here was really slow. I waited for a good five minutes at the table for a menu and it was nearly a half hour before I had my food.   Waitress didn t seem comfortable speaking English  but we got by on a mix of Spanish and English.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,37,this hole in the wall is an el salvadorian delight   not too much room inside  small tables  but great food.    the service was a leeeetle slow to get the food  but I m sure it s because they are making it hot and fresh       the roasted bananas with beans and sour cream was savory and sweet.  I could eat the bananas without anything else  they were dessert like and my toddler loved them  as well. Next time  I will probably get a side of roasted bananas for a couple bucks less and skip the accompanying sides.   The pupusas are so sinfully delicious.  At  2 a pop  it s a tasty deal.  This home made tortilla pocket can be stuffed with pork skins  cheese  beans and cheese or loroco and cheese.  My favorite one was the loroco and cheese.  I had never had loroco  they are unique and tasty little vegetables that look like flower buds that haven t opened  they taste like artichoke hearts.  I want more of them  i could see them being a very versatile ingredient to cook with at home.  Enjoy  bring an appetite and eat a loroco pupusa.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,38,This hole-in-the-wall restaurant is one of my family s absolutely favorites  mainly because it s the most authentic and delicious Salvadoran food in town  My husband  and kids  are Salvadore os so we know. It is NOT fancy at all but the pupusas  platanos  frijoles  tamales  yuca frita  chicharr n  empanadas  the Salvadoran kind   and the Cola Champ n make up for it  They do offer some Mexican or Tex-Mex food but I wouldn t get that here. If you come  get the food from where they re from. There s plenty of other  more authentic spots for enchiladas and the like. We ve taken non-Spanish speaking family there awhile ago and translated for them to the waitstaff so be prepared for them to speak limited English. They ll be happy you re there regardless 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,39,My rating is solely based on the food  not the staff   nor the building itself.   I always order Pupusas Revueltas with a side of Sour Cream and Curtido. To top it off  the delicious Horchata drink  This is as good as it gets here in Austin when it comes to Pupusas. The flavor is just right.  I knocked off 1 star just due to the recent times I visited and ordered something different. The Chicharr n with Yuca to me was a little bland  and overcooked.  But other than that  I will continue to come eat here without a doubt 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,40,More Salvadorian than Mexican style. Wish the pupusas had more filling. The chicken enchilada plate is a great value. The sauce is red. no verde option. Love the Salvadorian tamales. Don t think there s a wine option.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,41,Great service. Ordered a breakfast burrito and it was awesome. Great taste  nice portion.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,42,This is a great little spot that serves up great Salvadoran foods. I recommend the pupusas de loroco. They don t always have loroco available but definitely worth trying 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,43,Being pregnant and all I craved Pupusas. So I called at 4 04 pm to place a order and arrived at 4 40 and after being told my order would be ready in 20 to 25 min so I figured that with my far  drive by the time i arrived  they would be ready . Well when I arrived the owner was at the register with her daughter and they both ignored me I stood there for 10 min until finally I ask the daughter hey I ordered 40 min ago she looks very rude  and replies  ten more min after I see her hand my order to some one else just boiled my blood walked out of there just glad I didn t pay will never be going back there again .
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,44,This is one of those hole-in-the-wall places that  if it was on Congress  would be HUGE fricken HUGE.  The food is awesome  the waitress was super nice and helpful... and she even spoke a few words of english.  I ate what she recommended the Salvadorian Combinated Platter  I think that s what it was called .  No  that s not a typo... it had the word  Cominated  in the title.  You could choose three of four things and I let the waitress choose for me.    It came with long plantains  or something similar   refried beans  some sort of sour cream  something that had a name similar to a  tamale  but was in actuality a Barry Bonds all-roided-up-but-noplace-to-go-but-in-my-mouth huge chicken tamale  and a pork-n-cheese pupusa.    It was awesome.... I highly recommend it all.  The combination of  a little plantain  a little sour cream  and a little refried bean all in one bite was sweet-sour-take-some-gettin -used-to good.  Pupusa was awesome.  Roid tamale  when I added their really fresh salsa  was great.  All of that for  7.  That s cheap enough to make a salsa-stuffed Beaumont boy grin.  I tasted Cory W s bacon -n- egg breakfast taco   1  and it was awesome... one of the best I ve had.   breakfast til 11 00   Cheap  awesome  hole-in-the-wall  Salvadorian food... I highly recommend checking it out.  And like others have said  it s not the easiest place in the world to hit.  If you are heading East on 290  exit Cameron  take a left on Cameron  and turn right into the gas station strip mall that is on the NE corner of Cameron and 290.  Worth it... I m stuffed and still craving it... and it s been 2 hours.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,45,Oh.  My.  God.  I may die from how tasty this meal is.  Back in San Francisco  a friend of mine lived down the street from this Salvadorian restaurant where we d go after a hard night of drinking and we ate these things called pupusas that were pretty much the best food ever.  My life is now compete.  Forget finding that perfect woman  forget finishing my remodel  forget grad school.  I found pupusas in Austin.  If you have not shared in the amazing experience that is a pupusa  then you have not lived.  That is all I feel I can say rationally  or not rationally  since I m about to die here .   6 for three pupusas  which is way too much food for one person.     yelpdeath 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,46,After reading recommendations on Yelp about this place  I decided to check it out for myself. Lucky me  It happens to be a 2 minute drive from where I work  so I conned a few co-workers into going with me  one of whom speaks fluent Spanish  and off we went.  Pro tip  the place is next to the Shamrock gas station at the corner of 183 and Cameron  just past an auto dealer. The address listed here  7901 Cameron  is probably correct  but that puts you next to some office buildings behind the actual place. Took us a few minutes to find it.  I will echo what more or less everyone has said here  have the pupusas. Have them. You will not regret it. Go there now  and eat pupusas. I tried the combo platter   7 for three out of four courses  with plantains  cheese pupusa and a tamale. The only complaint I had was that the tamale had too much breading  but the filling was awesome  went for the chicken one  they also contain potatoes . The refried beans were good. I was amazed  I thought I didn t like refried beans because every place I get them  they re either cold and stale or just...horrible. These were more than just eatable  they were actually really good.  There s a lot of food on this platter and some people I was there with had enchiladas - even more food  Next time I ll go for two pupusas and the plantains and I ll enjoy it even more.  Oh  and Mexican coke. I love it when places have this  and this is the only one other than Rudy s where I ve found it. Gotta love living close to the border. Whatever it is they serve in Coke cans in the US  it s not Coca Cola. Corn Syrup  What the hell. Spell it with me  s-u-g-a-r. Excuse my derail.  Either way  I paid just over ten bucks for food  drink and tips and I left the place highly satisfied. Yes  it s a hole in the wall. Yes  you may need to understand some basic Spanish to eat there  our waitress was actually pretty good at English . Yes  it s next to a gas station. No  those things do not matter  I ll be back  again and again and you should be to.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,47,Costa Del Sol s pupusas are five star.  Their pupusas are fried and stuffed corn tortillas.  I prefer the chicharron pupusa.  They are  2 each and I could eat several each day if I could convince myself that they are a health food.    Costa Del Sol also has very good tacos.  They can be a bit greasy  but are always full of flavor.    Salvadoran tamales are huge and Costa Del Sol s are no exception.  Honestly I would skip the tamales because you can find better tamales in town  but I don t know where you would get a better pupusa.  Despite its looks  this is not fast food.  Speaking of its looks...this is not the easiest place on the eyes and it would be easy to miss  but that would be your loss.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,48,Enjoyed the pupusas and will be back to try more of the menu. Order it to go if  Hole in the Wall  is not your thing. Really  with the right company and delicious food  how can you go wrong  I have only tried the pupusas.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,49,I tried Costa del Sol a few weeks ago after reading some of the reviews here and WOW  I was not disappointed  I had been craving pupusas  which I hadn t had since I left San Francisco two years ago  and theirs were exactly what I was hoping for. I had one of their bean and cheese pupusas and one of their chicharr n. I ordered a side of guacamole and crema  I m Mexican  I NEED to put avocado on everything   and they were even more fantastic. I m planning on going back today after work. YUM   Also  don t let its appearence deter you  it is not at all fancy  it s a simple hole-in-the-wall but has incredible food that you shouldn t miss out on.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,50,I have been eyeing this restaurant for  a while. I work close to this place and I always keep telling myself I need to go and have lunch there. so I went and got a order to go. Reading some of yelpers review  I went in and follow their direction regarding the pupusas. I got a combo plate  cheese and bean puposas  included fry yuca  fry pork  cole slaw. Wow  what a treat. The lady there was very friendly and I was reading the spanish local newspaper while I waited.  First all   I love yuca and pork. After eating all this  I just wanted to drink some coffee which I did and take Siesta. I couldn t take a siesta because I was work.  It brought back memories to when I was a teen in the land where I was born. Where people take the afternoon off to have lunch and have nap. Than head back to work after napping.   Don t let location scare you but remember it is hard to miss if you are not looking for.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,51,I just ate there. I m so damn full  but I m already wondering how soon my stomach will make room for more fried yuca so I can go right back to Costa del Sol.  I have never heard of these things -- fried yuca  pupusa  But I needed an  ethnic  experience as extra credit for a class  and after googling  pupusa  I knew I had to go to Costa del Sol.  I was not disappointed  The pupusa tasted great. I recommend the bean amp cheese one if you re into refried beans at all -- oh gosh  my mouth is watering. Cabbage is not my thing  but I definitely recommend at least trying the topping out because the crunchy texture is A  .  The fried yuca is a MUST. I made the mistake of not ordering this and had to restrain myself from eating my boyfriend s entire portion. Try it out with a squeeze of lime -- oh gosh  mouth watering again. I didn t expect it to be so good by any means.  I tried their chicken tamal as well. Great flavor but the soft  thick texture wasn t doing it for me. Next time I will try out the plantains instead.  I should mention that all of this food is incredibly filling. I don t know if it was the yuca or the pupusa but I had plenty of food left over to take home. For  7 per Combinated Plate  that s not bad at all.  All in all  I think even the pickiest eaters will like one of the above mentioned dishes. Service was a bit spotty but the food came out very quickly. Complimtenary chips fresh salsa and a cool selection of imported drinks. If you like trying out new food  I highly recommend Costa del Sol.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,52,Nestled in a corner of East Austin consisting of a closed gas station  a Honduran restaurant  a large concrete wall  and Republican headquarters  is a non-descript Central American cafe that never ceases to amaze.  Costa Del Sol may be staffed by some humble people in a re-purposed fast food joint  but they serve some mean cuisine  If you re not familiar with Salvadorian food  think Mexican but with a tropical twist. Instead of just rice and beans on the side  you also get a fried plantain. Instead of shredded lettuce as a garnish  you might also receive a sampling of mango and cole slaw. And there are regional favorites such as pupusas  ignore the name -- just try it   that you can t find just anywhere.  The place knows its Mexican favorites  as well. A friend of mine goes there with me on Fridays and he always orders the quesadillas. He swears they are they best he s ever had.  Confession  He s from Ohio. But that doesn t mean he s wrong.     The atmosphere may not be that great  the turnaround takes some patience  and there may be a slight language barrier depending on who helps you. But don t be fooled by the location or the appearance. Costa knows what it s doing here in Austin. While I m sure they re simple cooks sharing their culinary tradition in order to eke out a living  the flavor is nothing short of subversive 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,53,Still eating and eating and eating...  I heard that one of the ladies in the workshop I attended ate at a Salvadorean restaurant last night. So we looked on Yelp and decided to try Costa Del Sol.  I agree with W.D. - this is an easy place to miss  but I m glad that we found it. The serving sizes were very generous and we barely made a dent in all the food that we ordered. The grilled steak with onions and tomatoes was very flavorful. We also ordered the combination plate that included cubed fried pork  YUM    plantains and yucca. We also had to try one of their pupusas - the melding of cheese and meat melted in our mouths. I felt my coronary arteries starting to clog - but oh so good    We ve only a few more days left in Austin...so much to eat and so little time 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,54,I saw the child of the waitstaff play in the ice bin -- as in  sticking her hands in the ice bin over and over again. Not the only health code violation I saw during our lunch  but certainly the most memorable.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,55,I  heart  these pupusas   I have been driving past this place for years and hadn t dared to enter.  After living in Los Angeles for over 20 years  I figured how good could a Salvadorean restaurant really be in Austin.  Well I was wrong...so very wrong.  I have found pupusa heaven.  My taste buds keep saying  more please   but then my ass reminds me to keep it down to one a week.    I ordered the Combinated Salvadorean platter.  For  7 you can pick 3.  I chose the pork pupusa  chicken tamal and plantanos.  Forget all that other stuff...bring more pupusas     The plantanos and tamals were perfectly fine  but after the pupusa...i would have rather had more pupusas   It was perfectly crispy  fried  on the outside.  That s usually the problem...must have a slight  teeny crunch on the outside.  Hard to explain  but once you wrap your lips around their pupusas you will understand.  For those of you who didn t care for the tamal  please understand that they are not the same as the Mexican tamale.  These have potatoes and less  if any  cornmeal.  And they are huge      If you ever go to a Nicaraguan restaurant  you will see the nacatamal.  Again  different...it has raisins    So it s not really a direct comparison...more oranges to tangerines.  From now on  I ll just take a trough full of pupusas.  For  2 each  I am a happy woman      And the fact that this is in my hood...all the better 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,56,Hmmmm..... this is one of the few times I m gonna have to disagree with the majority of Yelpers. This place isn t that great.....  I wanted it to be good.... I am a big fan of  hole in the wall  type places... but this restaurant did not live up to the Yelp reviews. The food was decent  but far from excellent.... my chicken had all sorts of little  hard chunks  that I had to spit out. Gross. The location isn t convenient unless you live over by Cameron road. There are much better restaurants that are a lot closer to you.   I didn t get sick from the food and ate every bite... so I have to give it at least three stars  really almost gave it two . But I don t ever see myself visiting here again. I wouldn t come here looking to find your new  go to  restaurant.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,57,Great El Salvadoran food and great prices. Slow service and don t expect the servers english to be great  but that s part of the authentic vibe 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,58,Always call your order in. I have never had a good experience dining in at this place. The Loroco and the Bean and Cheese Pupusa s are to die for  If you haven t had a Pupusa  this is the place to try one. Don t skimp on the sauce and the slaw.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,59,I tried this place today to see what Salvadoran food is like at a realistic place  I tried a similar cuisine at the Domain and wasn t nearly as impressed .  The Combo Salvadoran Plate was very good with plantains  pupusa  and a couple of tamales.  The only drawback was slow service  but nothing unpleasant.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,60,AWESOME   I have driven past this place for years to and from the Airport and always wanted to try it but the timing was never right. I am so glad the stars finally aligned and I got to try it. I stopped by one day for lunch after dropping my wife off at the airport. I had the fried yucca and pork. The dish was fantastic. My wife is Puerto Rican so I am familiar with fried yucca and Costa Del Sol s was very much like fried yucca that I have enjoyed in Puerto Rico. The only thing lacking is the mojo dipping sauce that fried yucca is typically served with in Caribbean Cuisine.. The fried pork was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Just perfect.  The serving was more than ample.  In fact I think this dish can easily be shared by two people.   On another trip back from the airport we picked up take out for the whole family to enjoy. We shared Pupusas and fried yucca and pork. The wife agrees with my assessment of the fried yucca. We all enjoyed bean and cheese pupusas and pork and cheese pupusas. Basically the pupusas are stuffed corn masa. They served with a Salvadoran version of cole slaw which includes onions and lots of vinegar. I m not huge fan of cole slaw but I really liked this stuff.   The restaurant and menu are quite simple.  The prices are inexpensive. You won t find much ambiance here but you will find fantastic food  I have been wowed on two straight visits. I don t get by this part of town often but it will be very hard to pass by this place without stopping in the future.  I think this is going to turn into a favorite dive of mine.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,61,Awesome pupusas  They also have really great plantains. Some things get lost in translation since most people speak primarily spanish  but absolutely delicious 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,62,Tamales are not good at all   i had went there with my family and they mest up are whole order but is ok the food is alright  seems they just reheat the food when is order
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,63,They take for ever to serve your food I ve waited 1hour and 30 minutes for a simple plate and the attitude of their waitress it s poor I don t recommend to anyone to come here
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,64,Like the other reviewers  I tried this place after reading reviews.  I was not disappointed at all with the food     Its not an upscale restaurant  but its homely in its own way.  The interior is decorated with many Salvadorian items and it adds to the atmosphere.    It was my first time trying pupusas and they were very good   I had one that had pork and cheese and it was so delicious.   I also had the fried bananas and they were very good as well.    The prices were very reasonable  and cheap  and I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food  but wants to try something out of the box.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,65,Absolutely delicious food  I had the fried yucca with curtido and pupusas  the pupusa revuelta was my favorite   The food was very affordable as well. It is definitely a dive restaurant  which are usually my favorites. I will be back 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,66,First time having Salvadorian food and it was awesome  I had the Pupusas Revueltas con queso y loroco  cheese and loroco inside  and it was amaaaazing. I also tried their grilled shrimp  camarones a la plancha  and it was delicious. I really wish they were walking distance to campus because I would be there so often.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,67,I love there food they give me what I want  plus Mari. And Sara. Give me the best service. the only reason for the 4 stars is because the ac never work.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,68,Pupusas were delicious  best I ve tasted so far. Restaurant itself is old and outdated but the food and friendly staff make up for it.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,69,Probably the best pupusas in Austin which seems to be a town where authentic food is hard to find. SERVICE SUCKS DO NOT EAT THERE I RECOMMEND AN ORDER TO GO    but the pupusas are delicious the meat is good...
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,70,Really awful service. over 5 minutes for a first greet after sitting down.  the girl who took our order could hardly speak english or understand.  Didn t understand the concept of ordering an appetizer first then meal.  Did I mention super slow service   oh yeah  the food was really crappy and bland and basic.  the only decent thing was the plaintains.  I ordered two tacos as my meal after ordering the less than mediocre  salvadorian combinated plate   their spelling  not mine .  Whether it was chicken or pork or beef   all the meat seemed stale and dried out.throughout both app and main course.  The pupusa was good though.  That and the plaintains.  Every other aspect of that place was below standards.  And the  3 imported beer was a silver lining.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,71,Gooooood  . Pupusas..good.  .plantins and very goovery goooooooood .gooooooodgoogolplex
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,72,Overcooked and dry meats.  Papusas were not bad and the service was friendly.  The food across the board was a bunch of low quality ingredients thrown together.  You do get a lot of gruel for  10 but there was an underlying  residual base flavor throughout the food that I do not believe was intentional.  The beans  the meats  the slops and whatnot all had a very subtle taste and smell that one would associate with old cooking oil and freezer burn.  We were so bummed.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,73,I don t think I can type a cogent review  because saliva is pooling in my mouth as I think about the pupusas at Costa Del Sol. And that purple-cabbage-slaw stuff you put on top of the pupusa  so there s this interplay among tangy  crunchy  mild  greasy  cheesy  corn-y.... Ohhhh god  gotta go to Costa del Sol asap...
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,74,I am from El Salvador and unfortunately this is the place where you can find the best pupusas in Austin. I say  unfortunately  because the customer service is horrible. The restaurant itself is not nice  is kind of a cheap cafeteria. I went today with my wife and after waiting for about half an hour  one of the owners came to say to us to move to a different table as he needed to accomodate another numerous family. Not to mention the way he dressed not the appropiate to be the owner.  I have been here before several times but this has been the last time that I will visit this place. Food is good but I am not willing to be supporting such kind of people who dont show interest in having a better atmosphere....ah   not to mention if you need to use the bathroom.....good luck with that.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,75,me and some friends went when it wasn t full expecting it to be fast service  Iv heard that this place had amazing food especially the popusas  I cant complain the popusas were really good  but service sucked  first the waitress gave us ugly ass faces and we Hispanics so I don t know what her deal was  she only served us one basket of chips and it was a large party.  second the food took ONE hour to get to us and not all at once little by little ten min in between each food that came out so really more then one hour  then she gets 2 orders wrong  and it turns out to be the simplest one  cheese quesadillas and she brought my 3 and 1 yr old a big ol plate of enchiladas with rice and beans  how do you confuse that     as we were eating she never came back to take the plates away or to even refill our drinks       bad service didn t like being there at all  wont go again..
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,76,Very nice experience.  I ordered the pupusas  pork and cheese and squash and cheese  and as everyone has said they were fantastic for  2 bucks a pop.  Also  I added a fried fish dish and they kindly substituted the beans and rice for bananas. .The fish was good  but the bananas were the best I have ever had.. I liked the bananas better than the pupusas. The waitress was from El Salvador and she was extremely pleasant.. Overall  it was a great change of pace..
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,77,The pupusas are fantastic.  Be sure to try the cabbage topping.  Everything else I ve had here has been good as well  and the services is very friendly  although their English is a little spotty .
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,78,So glad that I ve discovered this little gem. Don t be run off by its shady strip mall existence  this is fantastic salvadorian food that won t put much of a dent in the wallet. The plantains were delicious as were both pork and cheese and loroco and cheese pupusas. Awesome chips  dips and salsa. I ll definitely be back 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,79,Let me start off by saying that I left Costa Del Sol in a food induced coma  the good kind...if that makes any sense. The portions were massive and our food was brought out to us in a timely manner  not to mention everything was FRESH    I washed down my delicious meal  the Yucca Frita plate  with an Agua de Sandia... TASTE BUDS HEAVEN    Prices were reasonable  and the two ladies working were very nice. I will most definitely be returning.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,80,Pupusas there are awesome. Flatbread stuffed with pork  beans  cheese.. I usually get a couple of those and a tamale with a mexican coke...
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,81,I m a fan because honestly their are not many options in ATX for pupusas. Service leaves allot to be desired. I ve had all the Salvadoran dishes. Pupusas are always excelent along with the curtido and salsa. The tamales are pretty good as well. Mariscada is freakin awesome. Yuca frita con chicharron is to die for. Salvadoran beer selection is really good. Would recommend Pilsner or Suprema. Viva El Salvador 
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,82,Las popusas are good  specially the chicharon with queso.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,83,The place is in the same strip as a honduran restaurant that does not accept credit cards and a gas station. The prices are moderate for the mexican plates. The food not the most original nor flavorful. Stale chips with some very mediocre salsa. Tried the tamal...small and overpriced. The combination plate of two meats...carnitas and pastor with flour tortillas  not most memorable dish. Pupusas with cheese and beans were the only thing I ve enjoyed. But came with some sort of cole slaw that I could have done without.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,84,I have been driving by this place for years  and would never have thought about eating here. I am a huge fan of hole-in-the-wall restaurants  especially mexican and latin american places. Today I read the reviews for this place and got totally stoked on papusas  and especially yucca  which is one of my favorite foods. I opted for the Combinated Platter with tamal   fried  yucca  and laroco papusa. I ll have to say it was pretty damn good  but not quite what I was expecting after reading the reviews. It s not the best I ve ever had  but I definitely eat there again. I think next time I go I will order off the mexican dishes menu.  The waitstaff was incredibly nice and helpful  and the atmosphere was about what you would expect.  I did really enjoy fried yucca  which I have not had before  but I much prefer a cuban style yucca  such as what you would get at Habana  which is phenominal  .  The laroco  which is basically a squash flower  papusa was pretty awesome  but once again  not the best papusa ever. Tamal was really good  maybe a little bit dry  but some of the sour cream and salsa took care of that. The fried pork that came with the fried yucca was interesting  but really pretty good. My wife got the same dish but with plantanes instead of the tamal  which were very delicous. I would recommend that if you re reading this  you should go eat there.  And for anyone trying to find the place from the picture  they have moved. It is located in the same parking lot strip center  but in a building up next to the road which is much easier to spot.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,85,Really big fan of the pupusas and plantains here. Came in on the weekend and the place was packed with people. Only one server appeared to know English fluently  they all stared at us and called her over to wait on us .   If you re looking for fast service -- this probably isn t your place. The waitress was pretty slow in taking our orders and giving us the check  but I think it s because they don t want to rush anyone and maybe even halfway expect you to grab their attention  which I saw many tables do  just wave to grab a waitress . It s a very casual  no frills place.  The prices are excellent  the serving portions are large  and the Salvadorean food is pretty satisfying. It isn t in the nicest part of town  and the place is divey  but I think the food makes it worth a visit alone.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,86,YESS   Good pupusas are hard to find but Costa del Sol solves this problem. Authentic Salvadorian food totally love it.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,87,Costa del Sol has authentic food. Since moving to Austin from the Dallas area  I was looking for a restaurant with some real Salvadorian food. There s a lot of Salvadorian restaurants in the DFW area  but not many in Austin  so I m glad this place exists. Prices are good. The pupusas aren t that great  but the tamales are. It s also pretty cheap.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,88,Good pupusas but my favorite food here is Yuca Frita I recommend this place
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,89,1 for Service and Atmosphere  3-4 for food quality and taste.  I would give 2  if possible.  I ordered a Salvadoran combination plate with yucca  plantains  and of course  a pupusa.  I also ordered an extra pupusa so I could have two varieties  chicarron for one  bean and cheese for the other .  Neither of the servers that came by spoke English which I generally don t have a problem with  especially in a place like this  but I had a hard time even getting my simple order across.  Just as others have said  the food took quite a while to be ready.  My meal arrived without any curtido  slaw   so I figured this was just their own way of serving the pupusas and went ahead eating them.  At least 10 minutes later  out comes a bowl of curtido   It was really good but no one even mentioned the delay when they brought out the order.  It was more like  throw it down and rush away as fast as possible .  Every time someone came by the table and I asked for something  I would get one word out and they would rush away.  At one point  I needed another soda  ketchup  and water.  No one ever came by to ask how everything was or to see if we needed anything.  It was more like me calling them back to tell them what we needed.  I m not demanding but when it s 90 degrees in there due to failing or non-existent A C  a refill on drinks is even more important than usual.  The atmosphere was cheap and stifling.  The service pretty horrible.  The puposas and slaw were delicious but the plaintains  with beans and sour cream  were nothing remarkable.  Oh  and the yucca never came out even though I asked three times.    My daughter has a chicken fingers kids meal.  I don t expect this to be a speciality by any means  but the thin chicken was dry and salty.  We were there around 3 in the afternoon  so it s not like there was a huge rush.    We may or may not be back.  I think we ll try Gloria s next time and pay a little more for better service and atmosphere.  This is where I tried pupusas for the first time  with my El Salvadoran boss  and so it s worth going back.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,90,Found this place through the Yelp app and I have to concur with the other reviews. This place is awesome.   The food was amazing and cheap. I spent around  4 on two fajita tacos and felt really full when I was done. The complimentary chips and salsa were on par as well.   The place was clean and service was fast. Would definitely visit again and recommend to friends.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,91,This place is authentic and DELICIOUS  Its what most call a  hole in the wall  but if youre looking for good Salvadoran  this is it. Broken english is spoken and enough to understand. If youve never had the food  try Pupusas made with  chicharon  which is pork and try cheese  queso .  The tamales are worth tasting   de puerco  is pork and  pollo  are delicious. DONT EXPECT your average mexican tamales...but a packaged delight.  I personally LOVE the  empanadas  de platano  for dessert  a fried plantain filled with a banana custard.  ENJOY    
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,92,I first experienced papusas in Beliz and later in Honduras.  I went searching for that same basic street food flavor after someone recommended Costa Del Sol.  It was great.  Very authentic based on my limited experience.  The overall restaurant was very nice but simple.  The chips and salsa was good and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive  I will definitely go back and try some other dishes but for now  the papusas were great.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,93,Good food   Specially  pupusas is the best    ... But bad service... I liked to go on Friday but is always the same white girl .. really bad service from her    They need to learn how to be a good server  
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,94,Food was great from what was available. They were out of a few of the items we wanted  which were the only reasons we went to try the restaurant in the first place. The 3 pupusas available and platanos were delicious. The service was horrible though. We were definitely treated differently poorly because we were not Latin looking  even though we speak perfect Spanish. The place is a hole in the wall. Very small. Prices were fine. If we go back  we will definitely get it to-go.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,95,Pupusas are what this Salvadorean restaurant are all about.  My faves are the beans and cheese  the chicharrones  and just cheese.  The maduros  fried sweet plantains  with beans and sour cream are the best.  Thus is NOT fast food so expect a wait cuz it s worth it.  The interior is not too fancy and gets hot in the summer - you ve been advised.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,96,First of all...this place is LEGIT. It s in this strip mall with a gas station that has long since closed  and a hair place called Knappy or Knot. Like others have said  it s kind of a hole-in-the-wall place. When I walked in with my amazonian roommate  we got freaking eye raped by 75  of the male patrons. Also we didn t know that you re supposed to seat yourself so we just stood there for a while in uncomfortableness. The waitress didn t really speak English  but good thing my roommate spoke Spanish  She got 5 pupusas  queso solo  and some platanos  which was a meal in itself...  and I got the plato combinato with pastor and carnitas. Those pupusas are really filling  and I like the kimchi-like vegetable slaw stuff that comes with it. The carnitas and pastor were a little on the dry side but really flavorful. Our food took FOREVER to come out...but man  it was so good. I had half of a pupusa and about 20  of my food and I was full. Next time I go back I m going to try some of their seafood items.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,97,The flavor was awesome   My co-worker and I went for lunch and we were in and out in 45 minutes.   The prices are unbeatable.  The pupusas and tamales are very good.
Costa Del Sol Restaurant,98,If you re looking for a place with mediocre food and staff that doesn t pay as much attention to it s white customers as it does to it s hispanic customers then go right away   Okay enough snideremarks... honestly the food isn t that good. I previously ordered a salvador taco plate and it was actually pretty bad tasting and not at all what I thought it was going to be. I have also had a bean and cheese papussa  not sure if I am spelling it correctly  and it was actually pretty good. Their chips and salsa if they remember to bring them to your table  are good enough. Today I had a potato  egg  and cheese breakfast taco. Ugh. The tortilla tasted like it was straight from the cheap bag of HEB tortillas  I don t mind those but if I m eating out I want to enjoy something of a bit higher quality than I can throw together at home for less money.  The service was slow and not polite. I asked for an extra tortilla as their breakfast tacos are stuffed  still not tastey though  and her response was a loud  HUH   I was not greeted when I entered or told  have a nice day  or  thank you  when I left. The server didn t come to check to see how my food was  and it took a while for one breakfast taco to come otu of the kitchen. I would not recommend this place to anyone but if you do happen to go their the papusa is the only thing I would recommend.
Taqueria Guadalajara,1,Major food coma  I could eat till my stomach bursted this place is soooo good   Lived in Austin for 5 years and this is the best Mexican restaurant I ve been to  Plus it s super cute and the staff is fast  I can see why finding a parking spot was hard here  yummy food. Definitely coming back and telling everyone about it 
Taqueria Guadalajara,2,Well it s been 8 long years since we have come here...but I had to return on the recommendation from a friend as it s been totally revamped....service was good  a little slow but the place was jumping. Chips   salsaS and Queso hit the table. I feel all 3 Salsas have a bit of a bite to them...Green being my favorite. Wife went with the Enchilada Texanas and double rice. Ground beef was excellent and went well with the sauce...along with a few dashes  of the bottled red sauce. She really enjoyed them  I had the Enchiladas Bandera which was delicious ...and we will say they Chiladas were fat and Loaded with cheese   We both loved the rice and the beans were spot on ...Definitely will be back to try the vast menu.
Taqueria Guadalajara,3,Ordered a michelada and spouse ordered a 6 pack of dressed up beer. Waitress cokes back saying she couldn t put that much beer on the table for 2 people so we canceled that and just ordered food. 25 minutes later  here comes the food. Tacos cold as hell like if they had them in the fridge. Horrible service
Taqueria Guadalajara,4,Best tortilla soup in town  Fajitas are the bomb too and they give you all the fixings for a great sized meal.
Taqueria Guadalajara,5,Can t go wrong with anything on the menu. Had it all  love it all. Torta Cubana I highly recommend. Order the molcajete...you will not be disappointed   
Taqueria Guadalajara,6,When in North Austin  eat at Taqueria Guadalajara because it got 5 stars by me and my partner and we re from Corpus Christi  First of all get the chil  con queso compuesto appetizer dip  This was the best chil  con queso we ever ate  The picadillo meat in the dip was so flavorful and delish. It did not make it greasy at all  We also had a quesadilla app  I chose chicken fajita but it was more like shredded chicken  so get beef fajita quesadilla instead   I ordered the bacon burger w cheese and it was extremely delicious. My partner had the enchiladas supremas and that is what I am gonna order next time with picadillo meat. He had them w beef fajita and were scrumptious  The refied beans were the best I ever tasted. I like refried beans made like Taqueria Guadalajara made them.  creamy The Spanish rice also got my A  approval. The chips and salsa were to die for. The salsa is seasoned to perfection  We did not drink liquor but the bar was packed. The whole restaurant was packed at 11pm on a Tuesday  The service was excellent. And the price was right  chil  con queso app  quesadilla app  bacon cheese burger w fries  enchilada suprema plate  2 teas for  46 not including tip. Run to this restaurant before all of Austin finds out about it.  A    and we know Mexican food. 
Taqueria Guadalajara,7,Being from Houston I miss having a taqueria on every corner. So imagine my excitement when I found this place  It is perfect   The pastor torta is my go to. Love all their salsas. The only downside is their margarita is terrible.   Service is great. The restaurant is insanely ornate. I love sitting surrounded by all the colors. We drive from Georgetown to go about once a month  it s that good 
Taqueria Guadalajara,8,Always friendly  fresh and delicious. My family has been coming here for over 15 years and it s still one of our favorite places to go. Always order the queso  they have the best flavor and consistency 
Taqueria Guadalajara,9,The food is amazing  but the service is so bad  my sister she went to buy some candies  and the men who was there just ignored her  and she was literally talking to him so loud  he just ignored her
Taqueria Guadalajara,10,My brother and I ordered the chicken quesadillas tonight. The prices were reasonable. Also  the food was really good  but I would have preferred for them to be slightly more cooked  the tortilla . Also  more toppings  jalepenos  pico  would have been great. I will likely visit again in the future.
Taqueria Guadalajara,11,The pandemic has certainly slowed things down at Guadalajara  but the food is still very good and service is outstanding. The tables are spread out for safety and employees are wearing masks. Hand sanitizer is right in the front door so you can use it on your way in and out.   Please stop by for some tasty Mexican food to help them keep the doors open.
Taqueria Guadalajara,12,The Door Dash my family got last night was awful. It would be exhaustive to relate which of the food items were passable or odd vs awful -- none of it was good -- so here s the showstopper. When the food arrived I was hungry so as my wife set the table I picked up one of the two containers of Charro beans. Without opening it I noticed the contents seemed watery  broth had no body at all. I proceed to open and taste and the dominant  flavor  is vinegar. I say to my wife  these beans aren t right   she asks  what do you mean  and I say  just taste and see . She says  it tastes like they used pickled jalapeno juice  and I say  but it s not spicey   to which she says  ... but it s vinegar . The containers of Charro beans we paid for went straight to the trash. The rest of the food varied from odd to maybe passable if one is being charitable. Like my crispy taco  just set in the container with the enchiladas and a soggy mess when delivered. It may be if you know what they do that s okay and what to avoid maybe you can get decent food  but I m not dropping  50 again and again to figure it out. The food I got was just awful. I don t even know how you work vinegar in any form into any pinto bean recipe.
Taqueria Guadalajara,13,This place was OK.   Interior was pretty. Hand drawn and paintings were displayed all throughout the walls. Even the ceiling had paintings  Pretty cool.   I ordered the Enchiladas Bandera. They were not what I expected. One was TexMex with orange cheese  maybe American cheese    the middle one was a green enchilada  and the last one was a white tortilla with nacho sauce on top. Or at least it tasted like that. I only ate the first two enchiladas and sides. I didn t like that the cheese tasted like American Kraft cheese. At least use Cheddar    My partner ordered the chimichanga. The filling was ground beef and peas. Not sure why  He thought it was okay as we were just hungry. Sides were better.   My partner  who is a non Spanish speaker  did not feel comfortable eating here. Our waitress wouldn t talk to him even though she knew some Spanish    Overall  it was okay  like I said. We got free chips and lots of salsa. But still. Food and service could be better.
Taqueria Guadalajara,14,I haven t yelped much lately but I m making a point for Guadalajara.... an awesome place to go.     The decor   ambiance is over the top awesome.   Beautiful furniture and woodwork... and even a disco light bar.   The staff was super friendly as they delivered my heaping sizzle of delicious juicy beef fajitas.    CHIPS y SALSA RANKING  7 out of 10.    decent red and a tomatillo.   But they also have that super killer hot creamy green salsa similar to Taco Deli.   The 3 together make a killer combo.   Chips weren t memorable but did their job as an undistracting funnel for the salsa.
Taqueria Guadalajara,15,While the food can be good  the customer service is awful and mixed with the long wait  mess up of our orders and terrible customer service it makes the food not even worth it. We waited forty minutes to have our order messed up  no worries I thought. Took them multiple times to get simple instructions right and 30 minutes later we got to eat. The employees are very rude too. Won t be eating here again
Taqueria Guadalajara,16,Resturant personal is rude. I have had two orders messed up now and they refuse to take responsibility. I gave them a second chance and again messed it up and didn t make it right. When I told them I would Wright a review they said they didn t care and for me to go for it. Trust me there is way better food then this place.
Taqueria Guadalajara,17,Placed an order through doordash and the original delivery driver stole and canceled the order. Door dash automatically replaced my order and when the second dasher showed up for the food  they refused to remake the order. Don t eat here  the staff is rude and it s waste of time and money.
Taqueria Guadalajara,18,Service and food were very good. I had the Carnitas with corn tortillas it was perfect.  Would recommend.
Taqueria Guadalajara,19,We loved this  place the renovations and absolutely love the ambience and flavor now.  The Rita s are delicious along with the four salsas 
Taqueria Guadalajara,20,One of my coworkers recommended me to try this restaurant and since then  we come here every week. The chips and green salsa are the booms    The prices are reasonable and the food are delicious. Highly recommended 
Taqueria Guadalajara,21,The restaurant is very pretty and you can tell they put a lot of money in the renovation. The biggest issue is the wait is ridiculous  it took almost an hour after we ordered before we received our food. No one came in to check on us either as it seems our original waitress left. When we finally did get our food it was mediocre at best
Taqueria Guadalajara,22,I had the chicken fajitas and they were very good- a delicious combination of thin chicken strips  jalapeno and onions. I asked for extra avocado salsa to put on the tacos I made with corn tortillas. It wasn t a real big portion but authentic homemade food.
Taqueria Guadalajara,23,This happened at their other location on 620  but it s the same local restaurant chain.  It makes sense to expect it at the other location too.  Especially with CoronaVirus  this local restaurant chain is putting all of Austin at risk.  I found significant larva and large flying bugs in my drinks there.  Larva only means the bugs have been reproducing.  I can only imagine the amount of germs that would be found in their kitchen   This experience also has horrible optics.  My girlfriend and I each ordered a drink.  Her drink was sickening sweet  and I asked for a remake  I even took a sip to verify .  They didn t want to make a new one without charging me for the old one plus the new.  It s not like she finished her drink before asking for a new one.  After a big altercation  they finally agreed to remake it to go.  I guarantee a lot of people would assume it was intentional  because the remade drink was the one with the bugs in it.  Perception is just as important.
Taqueria Guadalajara,24,la comida muy rica el servicio excelente no les recomiendo los jueves  est  una persona anim ndo pero tienen la musica muy recio ay ni os y grita en el micr fono muy recio eso queda para las cantinas  la verdad solo eso  de ah  todo excelente mi pareja y yo optamos por irnos de lo fastidioso que estaba
Taqueria Guadalajara,25,The food was cold and the quesadilla had no cheese in it  my boyfriends meal was served in a broken plate. Drinks were good but the cup was really stained with broken top part. The service was bad  oh and so many flies inside the restaurant.
Taqueria Guadalajara,26,Worst restaurant ive ever been to. Came in waited 1hour for order of fajita that ended ip being burnt. Waitress was very rude. Better off going to food truck than this place
Taqueria Guadalajara,27,Actually it was really yummy. I wish I had more stomach. Its kinda small in there but smells good. You can definitely tell the ac units are new  I did find myself get cold. Thats normals in austin tho. All in all it was a great experience 
Taqueria Guadalajara,28,I went to eat today and a order some shrimp parrillada  And is not any flavor on it I m very disappointed and my sister order some mix parrillada too
Taqueria Guadalajara,29,We ordered a late night takeout and arrived 30 minutes before the restaurant closed to pick it up. The door was locked and we had to stand out in the rain and bang on the window while the bartender and a server ignored us. Finally a manager saw us and came to the door and begrudgingly asked what we needed. Terrible service
Taqueria Guadalajara,30,Newly rebuilt and reopened Guadalajara is a beautifully decorated space  worth a visit  and has very reasonable prices. Plus we had great service from our waitress  gracIas Hermis . I came for breakfast and had a bacon and mushroom omelet that was served with refried beans and potatoes. Although not a traditional Mexican dish  it was well made and I enjoyed it. Whenever I want great Mexican fare this will be  1 on my list. I m looking forward to many more visits in the future.
Taqueria Guadalajara,31,I got the carne asada tacos  the meat was tough and no flavor.  I came with avocado slices  grilled peppers and onions.  No worth  12 for 3 tacos.  No going back.
Taqueria Guadalajara,32,usually love this place. however last night changed that for me. roaches were everywhere and the service was below average. we usually sit at the bar not at a table. i guess that s why we never see the roaches.
Taqueria Guadalajara,33,Very simply  the food here was authentic and cooked perfectly  The atmosphere was very fitting and the portion sizes were more than enough  Not too pricey  and definitely will recommend to everyone 
Taqueria Guadalajara,34,Masks just covering their mouths . All of the servers. Server we had got all the orders wrong. Checked on us twice. Place started off great when it opened now it s going down hill.
Taqueria Guadalajara,35,Delicious. The cheese enchiladas are excellent. The delivery packaging keeps things delicious.
Taqueria Guadalajara,36,Great place .Great food service is quick do not go through the drive through the wait inside is better at least when i go in the morning better place in the morning
Taqueria Guadalajara,37,This place is the worst. So overrated with the nice building and all. The food is not that great at all. I waited 20 min almost at the drive thru for one taco. I got out of the car and knocked on the window  even drove back through the drive thru twice because there was no line. The sad part was when I asked about the long wait  she rolled her eyes  and offered no apoplogies what so ever   This had actually happened once before that s why Im writing the review now.
Taqueria Guadalajara,38,Bleh.... This place is packed  oddly enough. Service was below average  Clearly irritating for her to speak  American . I asked her if any of the dishes could be made extra spicy  I love and crave spicy food   and she said  No . OK  we re off to a good start here... When the dish came  I asked for a side of  hot  sauce. The sauce she brought was ridiculously mild. Finally  it took ridiculously long time to get the check  pay  and get out of there... Food was good  but not  that  good. Sooooo many other  hopefully  better options  walking distance.
Taqueria Guadalajara,39,One of the more authentic and traditional Mexican restaurants in Austin. The staff are all fantastic and provide great service. Since discovering this places a couple months ago  it s my go to Mexican restaurant. The pricing is very affordable and they give a huge portion of delicious food. There is nothing on their menu that I have not like.
Taqueria Guadalajara,40,According to Yelp  I ve been here 28 times. I think that speaks for itself. I live in the neighborhood and therefore have many options. The food and service are excellent. I look forward to at least 28 more visits    And I m the Duke. Just so you know.
Taqueria Guadalajara,41,Love the asada tacos but I m consistently waiting for more than 15 minutes EVERY time we order these plates through the drive thru. If the wait wasn t so long  they d have more of my business.   The asada taco plate comes with 5 asada tacos with onions and cilantro  beans  and a side of freshly sliced radish and a bacon wrapped jalape o 
Taqueria Guadalajara,42,Apparently prices have gone up over the last few years.   No longer the best burrito deal in town.   Burrito is now  4.99  2016 pricing 
Taqueria Guadalajara,43,I have never had a problem with their other location. We decided to try this location last week  everything was great. So we came today for a late lunch. We got there around 3 30 and there was a 20 min wait   no problem . We didn t wait so long to be seated or get our order taken. About 10mins later we see our server walk out. No one came to say anything to us about the shift change. Half an hour later I decide to go ask what is going on with our order. I see other tables that have been a fraction of the time that we have been there get there food. They tell me because of the shift change it is taken a bit longer. I told them that doesn t explain how other tables that have been there for 15mins have gotten their food. Why didn t anyone tell us about the shift change  We had no drinks or chips and no one had been there to check on us. After 40 mins of waiting my parents food comes out. They keep telling me my food will be right out. It took another 10 mins. Once it did come out it was wrong. At this point I had lost my appetite. My parents asked for a Togo box and for my food to be removed since I never got it. It honestly was the most ridiculous thing to hear over and over again about the shift change cause our food to be taking so long. The management need to get there team on the same Paige like there other location. Would rather drive further than to revisit
Taqueria Guadalajara,44,Great   The ambiance is excellent. Much more authentic than a lot of local restaurants. The food was delicious   We ordered Fajitas for two and hAd plenty leftovers   The meat was succulent and hadd a marinated grilled flavor. The staff were friendly and seated us right away. We will be regulars. My favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin. The prices are very reasonable. A .
Taqueria Guadalajara,45,Real mexican food served  The best in North Austin.
Taqueria Guadalajara,46,Definitely a hole in the wall  parking and traffic on 620 are a pain  but the food makes up for it. More than decent portions and pick ups are ready when promised. Just really good food at reasonable prices.
Taqueria Guadalajara,47,This is for the chicken tortilla soup  which I ve had only twice  sadly. The broth is full of flavor and the chicken is moist with a little bit of texture from grilling. It s seriously phenomenal    Micheladas are also on point
Taqueria Guadalajara,48,I like that these guys open a 0600.  They used to be one of my regular stops for breakfast tacos on the way to work.  They have some pretty good breakfast deals on the tacos and they are tasty.  They use white cheese on their breakfast tacos  and  it works.  I like their sausage  egg  amp  cheese  SEX  and their equivalent with ham  HEX .  You can get a breakfast taco and a coffee for under three bucks   That s a pretty good deal.  Sometimes they over cook the eggs which can be a bad offset on the flavor.  The tostada s are pretty tasty  no complaints there.  The tamales are some pitiful shit that makes you wanna slap the poor fool sitting at the table next to you.  Seriously.  Three tamales with rice and beans for roughly  5 sounds like a pretty good deal.  Right   Well  in theory it is.  The tamales that I got were dreadful.  They were so dry  maybe been in the freezer too long   and had no fucking filling.  What I got was 99.9  masa.  They should be ashamed of themselves for serving such disappointment.  Especially in Austin.  Service here can be a bit of a disappointment.  The staff are friendly and all  but  just can t seem to grasp the concept.  Take today for example.  We went in and ordered our food.  Sidekicks tostada came out a good 10 minutes before my shameful tamales.  Good stop for breakfast tacos for sure.  Haven t really danced on the rest of the menu.  I like their late hours.  Open until 0100 on Fridays and Saturdays 
Taqueria Guadalajara,49,I love this place. It s been a while since I ve been  but it hasn t changed. The quality of the food is beyond good  and just dang tasty.  The interior is pretty big  and the atmosphere appropriate for a Mexican restaurant. Spanish music playing on the jukebox with families eating Sunday dinner.  I had the burrito plat  which comes with rice and beans  and you have a choice of filling out of like 10 meats  It s huge and definitely fills the tummy.  If you re in the Lamar Rundberg area  skip the fast food and come to Guadalajara s. You won t regret it   BTW  Yelp says it s closed Sunday  but they re open.

Taqueria Guadalajara,51,Our first time here. Service was good  courteous and quick. The place looks authentic as it appears to be we are the only non hispanic people there. The food was bad. Mostly bland. We had Huevos Rancheros and Breakfast tacos.  Bean in my tacos tastes burnt.  We came here since Ken s Subs  amp  Tacos is closed today and we didn t bring cash so we couldn t go to El Tacorrido.
Taqueria Guadalajara,52,This is my new favorite hole-in-the-wall Tex Mex diner. Big portions  cheap prices  not the best ambiance  but friendly service.   This is not the place to go to impress a date or if you are trying to stay healthy or any of that sort of thing. This is the place to go if you don t mind navigating giant potholes in the parking lot to get some good carne asada and queso. Rundberg Running Man is right there  so you can give him a wave on your way out. Love that guy 
Taqueria Guadalajara,53,Good food and lots of it  reasonably priced  and quick and friendly service. Live music on Sunday afternoon was a tad too loud while dining  but that s the only downside on a 2nd visit. First time for my dining partner there  and she will return with other guests in the future.
Taqueria Guadalajara,54,This is a review of today ... I haven t been here in a while but the service has changed ... I don t ask for much but I would like a refill of my beverage and chips to be replenished... I had carne guisada and it was excellent ... mariachi played and the restaurant was busy ... I live down the street and usually eat out in the area around my house ..  I will definitely be back hopefully have better service next time... oh and it s Sunday and yelp says they are  closed  if I would have checked yelp first or I would have chose another restaurant....
Taqueria Guadalajara,55,Another 5 star restaurant for me..... Love the food here as well... Friendly environment   perfect place to come eat breakfast tacos...... Yummy...  them huevos rancheros are damn good...
Taqueria Guadalajara,56,Awesome spot  Great food and service  Moved to the neighborhood and come here every other day. Never had a bad meal. Breakfast tacos are amazing and my best friend loves the taco salad 
Taqueria Guadalajara,57,Had breakfast here last Saturday morning. Was driving by and decided to give it a try  I haven t been to many authentic Mexican places in Austin. Was pleasantly surprised at their menu selection which included  aguas frescas.  I tried a pineapple one  and my friend got a tamarindo  they were both delicious  As for my breakfast I got migas  which were served with refried beans and potatoes. The customer service was great  our waitress was very friendly. I was also surprised on how clean it was  since the places was busy. Overall great experience 
Taqueria Guadalajara,58,Bad service. Food isn t that good. Too packed. The take so long to bring the food that you loose your appetite. Takes so long to pay.
Taqueria Guadalajara,59,Back in business after a long remodel and well worth the wait  Love the food  love the people  love the prices 
Taqueria Guadalajara,60,Super easy to order takeout although the lady spoke so fast it was hard to understand her. Don t be put off by the building s questionable appearance  The shrimp quesadilla is probably the best I ve ever had. The gorditas were only okay and the torta Cubana was pretty tasty. I appreciate the bilingual to-go menu and I didn t feel completely out of place since I m a guerita. The staff were friendly and welcoming and I look forward to having more shrimp quesadillas 
Taqueria Guadalajara,61,Better than Amaya s and Texican cafe   Now my favorite Mexican restaurant in Austin    
Taqueria Guadalajara,62,This is a sit-down restaurant with table service  but you can also order items for take-out at the counter. Prices are very reasonable  and of course the food is delicious  but the icing on the cake is how nice the waitstaff is to this conspicuous gringo. I also love that they are open until midnight during the week  and 1 a.m. on the weekends 
Taqueria Guadalajara,63,Service is terrible   I invited my friend to eat here one day  it was the worst decision ever. We waited about 7 mins to be seated and no one attended us  we decided to give the staff a few more minutes and still no help  not one person acknowledge us. A Mexican couple behind us came in  were immediately acknowledge and seated.   We decided to walk out and I felt so embarrassed I had to apologize to my friend.  This place is a fucking joke  I bet most of the staff is illegal.   Never wasting my time here again.
Taqueria Guadalajara,64,Poor service  waitress disappear...the food is bad  Please don t waste your money. Peor
Taqueria Guadalajara,65,Excelente environment  great fry fish. Definitely I ll come back. Reasonable price. Nice people
Taqueria Guadalajara,66,I m sitting here waiting to be served and not one person has come to my table. I m wondering is it because I m a Black sister. every time I come here I am treated differently. it is illegal to discriminate against a person race sex and so on Taqueria Guadalajara location N Lamar blvd.
Taqueria Guadalajara,67,The service was semi okay they didn t really come check on us but over all the food was great .  And my 80k   followers will know and come join this place ...
Taqueria Guadalajara,68,Love everything about this place. Service has always been great and food is amazing.  Fresh salsas and hand squeezed limonade.  Plus their deals for breakfast are unbeatable. I always get the 3 breakfast tacos or the migas. A must try.
Taqueria Guadalajara,69,Can t wait for this to open back up - we go about once a week and love it   The food is so amazing  the staff is always very friendly  and the food is so good   I wouldn t have survived my pregnancy cravings without this place 
Taqueria Guadalajara,70,Great food and service   Real mex food. My burrito was full of cheese and meat. Great ambience and really friendly and helpful staff.
Taqueria Guadalajara,71,I went here on a Tuesday night and it was pretty empty. But the food was not bad and neither are the prices I had the chicken fried chicken which was good with an iceberg lettuce salad  rice and beans.  My friend had the guisado and it was good. The Chips and salsa are awesome there   The Mexican coke is expensive since you can get an agua fresca for the same price and 3 times the quantity. Sadly  the agua frescas are made from syrup and are no bueno. The servers were trying to start their closing duties two hours before closing and it was a bit hard to get their attention at times. I think the place used to be a Wendy s
Taqueria Guadalajara,72,Nothing fancy about this place and that s just how it should be. The focus is in the food which is super flavorful and generously portioned.   The chicken enchiladas  tacos  get the corn tortillas they are superb  and torta were all scrumptious.
Taqueria Guadalajara,73,Overall I was glad I came here  probably an 8.75 10.  Service was good and the waitress was a good sport when I tried to half-assedly order in Spanish.  The wait staff was polite and I liked the  2.50 HH Coronas as well as the  2 tacos and free chips and salsa.  They have Micheladas for  3.75 at HH  I think   so if you like those  I think you d like it.  I wouldn t mind returning in the future.
Taqueria Guadalajara,74,Had our first and last visit last weekend. First ding  after placing our order  the food took forever to arrive. Unacceptably long. Second ding  I asked for corn tortillas but received flour.  Third ding  the food was gross and we all felt quite queasy after we ate just a portion. The cheese enchiladas had very little filling and were covered in a bland  bright orange sauce  supposed to be a red sauce and it wasn t even close . The gordita was equally bland and dry  dry  dry. Only the guacamole was halfway decent. The beans were a soupy mess. My stomach still churns if I think about this meal. I enjoyed the musicians who came in and played a song. But when they finished they went from table to table for tips and then they left. We were disappointed  as we would ve enjoyed more music as we waited the eons for our food.
Taqueria Guadalajara,75,We drove up Lamar looking for a different Mexican food place  but it turns out that it s now some kind of dollar tree or something  so we took a chance on Guadalajara. We just moved out here from California  and were looking for some authentic Mexican food  not Tex Mex. People  queso is not real Mexican food. Also  al pastor tacos should not be served in a burrito size tortilla  really.  Enough snobbery. We ordered an 2 al pastor tacos  a pollo guisada torta  and a large horchata. The woman who served us was super nice and very attentive. We were not disappointed in our quest. The pastor was fresh and served on two small corn tortillas with cilantro and onions. The chicken was also very fresh and the torta bread was fluffy and delicious. We would be lying if we said it was not the best horchata we have ever had.   The greatest part  We got outta there only  13.00  after tip  lighter than when we went in. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for awesome  cheap Mexican food and speedy  friendly service. The only reason we did not give the place 5 stars was they do not serve alcohol.
Taqueria Guadalajara,76,Good food and service  we both ordered the plate with a fantastic crispy taco  tamale and ground beef enchilada  brought us 3 kinds of sauces for the chips and meal  nice  very nice.
Taqueria Guadalajara,77,We were craving breakfast tacos  pho  and Vietnamese sandwiches  so we were heading to our favorite spot Thahn Nhi  so we didn t want to drive south Austin then north. So we opted to go for a randomly chosen Mexican restaurant taco stand.   Just our luck  right across from Thahn Nhi was Guadalajara -- I decided we should try it  since I noticed several trucks with ladders in the truck beds. Walking in  we were surprised by the clean and open layout. Music was playing from the jukebox and a friendly waitress seated us.  She brought us out warm chips. Free chips and salsa   always a plus  especially when you get both the green and red salsa  and then we ordered our tacos. Too bad we were a few minutes shy of 11am  because 3 tacos for  2.50 before 11am  But other than that they were still  1 each. Although chorizo wasn t on the menu  Curry Lover 1 ordered a chorizo and egg and I went for the sausage and egg adding nopolitos  cactus .   Looking at the rest of the menu  the food prices were pretty average Mexican restaurant prices. We ll be back another time to try more food  also the guava drink    They were both delicious and we went happily on our way across the street for some pho.  Extra stars for not being infiltrated by Austin hippies.   
Taqueria Guadalajara,78,Guadalajara is our favorite Sunday breakfast food establishment. Every Sunday we have breakfast brunch here and I ve never been disappointed. This last Sunday I had a combo plate with a enchilada de chile verde con pollo  gordita de barbacoa  and a tamale de chile verde con pollo. The gordita was huge and overstuffed. The enchilada was one of the best I ve tasted here in Austin. It was stuffed with pollo asado. The tamale was great as well. I m from the Western part of Texas Eastern part of New Mexico  and I have not been able to find good Mexican food here. Taqueria more than satisfies my pallette for a Mexican cuisine.  For breakfast  I usually order chilaquiles which are fried corn tortillas smothered in white cheese and chile verde. Delicious. I ve also eaten the huevos a la Mexicana. Both are super great dishes. One thing I was surprized about was them having tripas. I love tripas which are intestines. They re so good when they re a little crispy. Put some salsa on there and you have yourself a fiesta. Barbacoa was filled with flavor as well.
Taqueria Guadalajara,79,My boyfriend and I came here on Saturday night. We had passed it a few times as went to other places on North Lamar. It was always packed  so we decided to try it out on a Saturday night.   My boyfriend had the enchiladas and I had the menudo. I also ordered a tarmarindo juice. The tamarindo juice was fantastic  It tasted fresh and was not overly sweet. My menudo was really good  but it was a bit salty for my taste  NOTE  I don t put any salt on any of my dishes  so it was probably seasoned right. . The homemade tortillas made both our meals. They weren t thin and were hot and flavorful. My boyfriend loved his enchiladas.   Overall  this was a great place. We ll go back.
Taqueria Guadalajara,80,I liked this place  Authentic Mexican food. I got take out  and I was overwhelmed by the menu  and the waitress was super kind and helpful  She helped me decipher the menu. I ordered enchiladas and a tostada. The barbacoa on the tostada was flavorful  and the enchiladas were good too 
Taqueria Guadalajara,81,For the location and divey building  the food was better than expected.  Maybe I walked in expecting rubbish and this was a nice surprise   Crunchy tacos not bad at all.  Really clean establishment.
Taqueria Guadalajara,82,I had the enchiladas tejanos  think that was the name  red sauce yellow cheese .  The  5.75 lunch deal lured me in. Let s talk about what s good first   the red salsa was certainly good and the chips were fresh.  They had a roasted chipotle looking salsa that was okay.  They also had a green sauce  think Dona Anna if you ve been to TacoDeli   but it was twangy with lime and not appealing  at least straight on a chip. The best thing these folks have going for them are the corn tortillas.  They make their own and they were excellent.   Their charro beans were also spectacular. So let s talk about what wasn t so good   my meal.  The red sauce tasted like it was made by the gallon in a Sysco warehouse in southern California.  The yellow cheese was the right density  but didn t taste all that great.  Their rice was acceptable.  In the end  I didn t enjoy my meal as much as I was hoping for all the highlights it had. Service was fine  and if I was closer to this place in the morning  I would bet they can make some killer breakfast tacos with those corn tortillas.
Taqueria Guadalajara,83,My favorite Mexican restaurant  Great food at a very reasonable price  try the enchiladas veracruzanas . Very friendly and helpful staff   amazing micheladas and the occasional mariachi serenade.  What s not to love  Ole 
Taqueria Guadalajara,84,We ve been going here for a few years now several times a month and have never had any complaints. The food is always very good and the wait staff friendly. The portions are generous but that usually doesn t stop us from cleaning our plates. Nothing fancy  just very good food.
Taqueria Guadalajara,85,I ve been to Guadalajara a few times now  enough to write a 5 star review. The food definitely is amazing  especially for the prince. Every time we go here  we usually spend around  11 total. The servers are always super friendly in such a way that it makes me feel like this is a family-run business. The beef tacos are amazing and the nachos at Guadalajara are the best nachos in Austin  Top it all off with a horchata for a perfect affordable authentic Mexican meal. Yum  
Taqueria Guadalajara,86,First time and massively impressed. Tasted like it was made with love care and skill. Good service  pleasant staff. Salsa and pastor were exceptional. Can t wait to go back.
Taqueria Guadalajara,87,I ve been coming here for about six months now. The service here is pretty darn good for north Austin. Very attentive waitresses  very friendly. Not all the girls speak English  but most speak a little.   The food is very good  the salsa is outstanding. You can get breakfast type stuff anytime.  granted they charge a little more after like 11 00 am but you can t beat the prices even then   It s made to order and comes out pretty quick. It s not Tex-mex .. sort of an Arandas style but way better. Like the above people mentioned this place is incredibly cheap.  the prices here shows you how much you are getting ripped by other Mexican   Texmex places in town.  Many times I ve eat here with my girlfriend and left spending 15-17 dollars including tip.   I would recommend this place to anyone who lives near 183   Lamar area.   Let me also say that other Mexican restaurants in the area pale in comparison to this place.
Taqueria Guadalajara,88,It was mothers day and we couldn t find any restaurant that wasn t actually full of customers. My family was so hungry we decided to hit a small restaurant that would serve some Mexican authentic food. To our luck there s was this small restaurant by our house.   When we first got there the atmosphere felt very ho-my like. The waitress was very nice to us she took our orders and helped us choose some of the items from the menu. I got some yummy nachos that had ground beef on it with jalapenos. To top it off i drank some orchata water  it tastes like cinnamon and looks white. The nachos were very soft at the bottom but the top was the best because they literally covered my entire plate with cheese and beef. I couldn t finish my nachos so i took they home.   Over all i would say it was a good place to catch Mexican food. Its a place where you can catch good home made food. The menu had basically all the Mexican plates you could think of  including some fish plates. I would definitely go there again.
Taqueria Guadalajara,89,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. I always come here for the lemonade. If you re super hungry they give you alot of food and it is great quality. It is hard to find a REALLY good mexican restaurant in austin but this place definitely meets my expectations. I get the tortilla soup  the Carne asada  or the tacos. It s a sweet spot not too far from my house and I d recommend it for breakfast lunch and dinner. It s worth trying it for yourself. The staff is super friendly and since we ve gone there multiple times they remember us. Great staff  great food.
Taqueria Guadalajara,90,I m giving this place 4 stars knowing that it s not a real 4-star dining establishment. It s another one of those great value Mexican restaurants that have been part of my life for years. I love Guadalajara  and I know it isn t anything like what you may find listed with 4 stars in downtown Austin  or Houston  or NYC. It s really just another boring Mexican place  except that it  too  is an absolute kick ass value for really good food. Nothing makes me happier than to be racing home with 3 beef fajita tacos in a grease-soaked white paper bag on my floorboard while I salivate and dream of the euphoria I m about to experience. Some people do crack. I eat tacos. It s the same feeling  just that one kills you in 40 years  and the other kills you in 4 years.
Taqueria Guadalajara,91,Went to lunch here today with my lover. I had the red sauce pork tamales and they were not bad. I didn t think there was enough filling  it was more masa than filling. My lover got the milanesa which was very good. I will be getting milensa here on another visit. Theses plates came with a side of rice and beans. I really liked the rice  it had carrots and peas in it. The Horchata there is very good  its sweet and refreshing. The wait staff was nice but we didn t get served at the same time and they messed up my order by bringing the green sauce tamales however they corrected this. The atmosphere is welcoming and modest. Sometimes there s musicians who play songs for tips. Although mistakes were made this time its not a reason to not go back  we will be coming back here  hopefully next time for breakfast.
Taqueria Guadalajara,92,This has become a regular place for me. They have the yellow white cheese thing on the menu which is interesting. Good options for salsa. Lime comes with all the beer  so it meets all my basic requirements. They are very nice.
Taqueria Guadalajara,93,Holy     this place is good  We saw it open at like 11 00 Sunday night - I m giving it 5 stars because the food was incredible  the service was ok  but the pricing was superb  If you re looking for that cheap hole in the wall experience with really great food  especially late night  this is The Place 
Taqueria Guadalajara,94,Seriously this place is awesome. Totally authentic Mexican food. If you are accustomed to Tex-Mex and think that is what Mexican food is supposed to taste like  this may be different for you. Nevertheless the food is good and the service is great. I have been there over 10 times and have had a great experience every time. Took my father while he was visiting from Dallas and he still tells me he has to come back again just to eat at Guadalajara. One of my favorite places to eat in all of Austin.   Curtis Gary
Taqueria Guadalajara,95,3 tacos al pastor and a large dr. pepper for under  7     Good food  good prices  and friendly service     I come every weekend.
Taqueria Guadalajara,96,Loved this place. Very nice service. Food tastes amazing and very authentic. Which is hard to find considering most places are tex-mex style  not here though.
Taqueria Guadalajara,97,Straight amazing   Great price Great Food Great Service   A must for a hungry sat morn. Serve beer too      Head on over
Taqueria Guadalajara,98,On the outside it wasn t much to look at  but the inside of the restaurant smelled and looked very clean. The waitress was friendly. Free chips and salsa--though I am a salsa snob and was not impressed by either of them. The food was okay. I got the special chicken quesadilla and it was flavorful enough  but doesn t come with either guac or sour cream. I d return if I was in the area and starving.
Taqueria Guadalajara,99,They are clean  welcoming and and it s good to eat for a nice dinner place.
Taqueria Guadalajara,100,Horrible service at night waited for an hour for my drink and I only ordered a sprite.
Taqueria Guadalajara,101,I accidently stumbled on this restaurant one day. Seat yourself. They usually have univision or some spanish tv station playing  mexican soccer    Free chips  amp  salsa. I love their food  I usually get their beef caldo or their beef milanesa. They also serve horchata   When i get a craving for mexican nowadays  this is where i go. This place is clean  very inexpensive and worth it   and it is open until 12am i think 
Taqueria Guadalajara,102,Food was pretty good  but took awhile to prepare. Corn tortilla was cold on the taco  but otherwise pleased with this place.
Taqueria Guadalajara,103,They have good mexican food and are open  till 12 mon-thu  and 1am fri-sat  not sure on sun hours  as nocturnal 2nd shifter  I appreciate the late hours.
Carnitas el Guero,1,If I can impart a little wisdom to my fellow Yelpers  it s this... your enjoyment of the carnitas tacos here is largely dependent on how you order them. And they don t speak a ton of English  so pay close attention.   Unlike brisket  which is at its most delicious when it is  moist   carnitas are at their zenith when they are served lean.   So here is what you might ask for  in Spanish  - Un tacote de carnitas de maciza - En tortilla de maiz - Con cilantro y cebolla picadita   The word  maciza  is critically important.   You might not care for cilantro or onions or corn tortillas  but this is how they are traditionally served  with all the fixings.   I hope this will empower you to try the most loved Mexican tacos OF ALL  the way most Mexicans enjoy them.
Carnitas el Guero,2,I did not know what to expect for my first time at Carnitas el Guero and it did not disappoint.  We shared three entrees  Quesadilla  Gordita   amp  Tostada.  And I got what was called  I believe  essentially a pitcher of Tequila.  What it was a clay pitcher filled with tequila and something like a Squirt soda.  The food was delicious and the meat especially in the Quesadilla and Tostada were so good.  They were both pork.  Wow  would go back for those.  And the tequila pitcher was huge and delicious and it was only  14.  The prices were very reasonable and just a few things I would change in terms of the environment and food.  But def recommend 
Carnitas el Guero,3,It s a super authentic Mexican spot where there are fumes from the meat just circulating through the place and the staff will speak Spanish to you right away even though they can speak English if you want  Was cool to find this little cultural oasis in east the middle of town.  The food was good and salsas tasted great but the price was a little high for the food. I shouldn t assume Mexican food should be cheaper and you shouldn t either so don t expect to pay for a cheap hole in the wall type of Mexican spot. For a good sized meal  it ll be about the same price as a decent hip modern restaurant.   Super friendly staff and good food  worth checking out 
Carnitas el Guero,4,These carnitas tasted like we were back in Mexico. I mean seriously- I hope you speak Spanish  cause they don t speak a whole lot of English.  But it was totally worth it. If I had one complaint I would say we should ve gone a little lighter on the skin. But the aroma... we had to eat one taco in the car before going home because it smelled so good.  The rest barely made it inside before we tore into them. Gone in 10... maybe 15. So good 
Carnitas el Guero,5,This place was ridiculous. Super understated taqueria with power punch of flavor. Recommend the carnitas and chicken tacos  as well as the doraditas. Super inexpensive authentic Mexican tacos 
Carnitas el Guero,6,Venden puro puerco y esta muy bueno. Muy bien servido y puedes comer bastante como por  7-8. Lo que se me hizo lo m s bueno fue la orden de carnitas con la agua fresca de pi a lim n y pepino. Muy bien servido y las cebollitas y salsas le dan buen sabor a todo. Tienen servicio r pido entonces es muy buen lugar para ir frecuentemente. Creo que lo mejor que puedes hacer es pedir una libra de carnitas para llevar y te la hechas en tu casa agusto. Bastante recomendado.   They only sell pork and it s great. Everything is served in large portions and you can eat a decent meal for  7-8. What I liked the most was the order of carnitas and the agua fresca of pineapple  lime and cucumber. I thought it was fresh and perfectly sweetened. They have quick service which makes this a good spot to frequent. I recommend going here on the weekend  ordering a pound of carnitas and taking it home to enjoy with the family. Highly recommend this place
Carnitas el Guero,7,Quite possibly the best carnitas you re going to get in Austin. Yes  those are loaded words  but hey  I stand by them. These carnitas are good -  real  good. They fall into the category of  do one thing  and do it well   and boy howdy  do they do it well  Note  when ordering  you can get  just  the carnitas  or a mix of stuff - I recommend getting the mix  it s...amazeballs  Enjoy   
Carnitas el Guero,8,This review is for the Bastrop location.  We picked up Carnitas tonight and enjoyed it very much.  The meat was moist and tasty.  A pound comes with 10 tortillas  sauces and limes.  When you order  you can choose to get just meat  or mix of meat  stomach and skin.   We decided to keep it simple with just the carnita meat.   There are two salsas  a green and a roja chipotle as well as onions with lime I think and Mexican oregano.   As mentioned prior  they have a kick but all were excellent.    One tip is to bring cash.  They have a machine to accept cards  but thankfully the hostess told us prior that the machine has an 8  surcharge which is pretty insane.    But we really liked it and we will definitely go back.     It would be great if the owner would provide the menu on the website as it s currently not working.   Really happy these guys came out and setup shop in Bastrop 
Carnitas el Guero,9,SO good. We rolled late night and had chicken tortas  Al pastor  and carnitas quesadilla and all of it absolutely destroyed. This is the spot.
Carnitas el Guero,10,Exactly what the business name implies  Carnitas   This place is great  authentic style and even some of the staff don t speak English. I really feel as if I m ordering in Mexico.  The food and drinks are great. I ll certainly be back here if I m in the neighborhood.  Yummy 
Carnitas el Guero,11,Stop here for some authentic carnitas  Ample servings  fresh sauces and fresh lime. Friendly service.  This plate was  6.99 for one fried taco plus a pile of carnitas  with which we made three tacos. TopoChico was  2.00.
Carnitas el Guero,12,I have passed this place on Lamar multiple times and finally stopped this morning to try one of their tacos on the menu. I am a big fan of El Pastor tacos so ordered just one to go. The reviews lived up to its name of this place  Great taco  and the hot sauces have great flavor  I should of ordered 2-3 of them tacos  Next time I will  for I will be coming back for sure for some excellent El Pastor tacos and try other items on the menu as well  If you are ever in Austin  you have to try this place for great tacos on Lamar 
Carnitas el Guero,13,One of the best taco places in Austin that I ve tried so far. Love the fresh corn tortillas with the mixture of succulent pork and delicious salsas. 10 10. Some of the staff only speaks Spanish so brush up on your Spanish before you come.
Carnitas el Guero,14,Came here because of the high yelp reviews. It was a disappointment. The  carnitas  had no flavor what so ever and they were very dry. I keep seeing authentic but these are not authentic carnitas at all. Also the tortillas were so hot they were all stuck to each other and the hot sauce was extremely watered down.
Carnitas el Guero,15,If it wasn t for my friend who took me here I would have never even considered coming in and wouldn t even know what to order. It is located right off north Lamar.  I have to say it was a true authentic experience.  The menu is very small which to me it means that they really put it all in those dishes.  The place wasn t very big but also had another section you can sit at.  We dined in and felt we had plenty of space.  It was very intimate.    We ordered a pound of carnitas basically just tender soft pork with all the goods like skin and fatty part. I love how simple this dish is.  Just two types of salsa. Both hot. No mild salsa.  Also came with a side of pickled chopped onions with little tiny specs of what I believe was habenero.  Spicy if I get just the right amount.  A side of cilantro and some limes.   It comes with some hand made tortillas.  Soooo delicious.  It was the right amount of softness and warmth.  Put them all together in a tortilla and you got yourself a nice little treat in your mouth. You can even add a little day if you need to.  Honestly this dish is so simple but you can just taste home.  I m not Mexican but I know home when I taste it.   I also ordered their Aqua Fresca.  Fresh lemon  cucumber and pineapple juice all hand squeezed.  I watched the guy make it through this window.  Just how I like to know where my food and drinks come from.  Also  it was pretty refreshing.    For dessert  we went to the dessert place right next to it.  There were mangonadas and all kinds of treats such as ice cream and smoothies.  Check them out.
Carnitas el Guero,16,Most delicious Quesadillas   Very authentic Mexican food    Be sure And ask for your quesadilla with flour tortillas or they automatically use corn.
Carnitas el Guero,17,This place is legit. Ordered food to go and even after a few stops on the way home my pozole was still piping hot. It had great flavor  and it came with all the fixins. Carnitas were soft and moist. Overall great food 
Carnitas el Guero,18,The interior looks great  friendly staff  carnitas are good and the Pozole is fantastic  Also had the quesadilla de chicharron prensado and it was DELICIOUS.  They make the agua de Pepino con Limon individually which means you are getting this freshly made   Definitely coming back 
Carnitas el Guero,19,Best tacos ive had in austin yet. The pork is juicy and succulent and the tortillas are fresh- shame that gems like this dont get the recognition they deserve and instead austin praises mediocre establishments  tysons  taco deli  torchys  matts 
Carnitas el Guero,20,The carnitas tacos were sooo good. Just what you would expect from a carnitas taco. Loved that it was one of the only places open so late at night that is actually good.
Carnitas el Guero,21,Excellent food and great friendly service. We got our food quick and it had so much flavor. Portions could of been a bit larger but not a deal breaker. Would totally recommend.
Carnitas el Guero,22,These carnitas are quite the experience. These are the best tacos I ve ever eaten. I m not exaggerating. Its the truth. Ordering here is on expert  difficulty as they only speak Spanish and I don t. Am I learning Spanish to make ordering these tacos a little easier  Si.  There s also a menu to point at if you need.    Accepts AmEx  Yes
Carnitas el Guero,23,Menudo is nasty and smelly not cooked right  the carnitas are cold not even hot this place is hot so if you come bring your own fan and the costumer service is bad moving us to a different table to let other people sit down overall a bad experience. For better food quality go to sabeositas right on I-35 and rungberg
Carnitas el Guero,24,Spectacular service and amazing food  This place is the place for late night food    
Carnitas el Guero,25,Food was great service was friendly  I really enjoyed the food the pina Fresca was a little watery but overall everything wa great
Carnitas el Guero,26,I used to eat here a lot... it s a hole in the wall taco place that has decent tacos  but they put mirrors on the back wall  got a new menu and raised all their prices past the quality of their food. Adios  Guero s.
Carnitas el Guero,27,Carnitas were great and plenty on the personal order. You had enough meat for 3 tacos plus the crunchy taco. Flavor was on point. Salsas could of use a bit more kick but I am not going to complain about them.
Carnitas el Guero,28,Carnitas are soooo goood  Ordered carnitas by the pound and they were sooo good. Ordered pozole on the weekends snd it was so flavorful. Love their agua frescas as well. Is kid friendly.
Carnitas el Guero,29,Food is great. Being a Spanish speaker helps but don t worry about it if you don t. Staff is friendly and they will help you through the menu. Got the Orden Personal which was enough carnitas for about 5 tacos.
Taco Bronco,1,I used to think this place was perpetually closed as I always visited during the day for Micklethwait Craft Meats only to discover they open at night with the same staff and same great meat for their tacos    I usually get their Carnitas tacos and it only takes 2 before I m stuffed  Angel is also really cool and always kind when she takes my orders    Great job team  Best tacos in town hands down 
Taco Bronco,2,The brisket burrito of my dreams        Super cute taco truck from the micklethwait fam  using the BBQ in tacos  nachos  quesadillas  and the aforementioned BURRITO. Y all this burrito is called  El Jefe  and it has your choice of meat and potato hash inside  is smothered with queso and sour cream  guac  hot sauce  and homemade pickles on the side. I died and went to heaven. It s a fork and knife kind of situation for sure  but it packs in the flavor and is worth every bite. I ll be back to try the other items for sure  
Taco Bronco,3,I used to live for tacos until my waistband became too tight. I then decided to give up the tortillas whenever I had the chance. Its really difficult to say no to tortillas  I mean  breakfast  street tacos  burritos and wraps. They re just so handy and tasty.   Now then  I ran into some fine people at ACL Fest a few weeks ago who were eating some damn good looking tacos. They recommended the Taco Bronco food stand and I knew I was going to have a date with handheld goodness.   I eventually made it to the pop up and ordered two tacos. They were so flavorful  plentiful and filling. I went back the last day of the festival and had two more tacos. The employee that helped me told me that they were part of the Craft Meats crew at Micklethwait. Surprise   I can tell you this   I ve been telling everyone the last couple of weeks that they ve got to eat here. Now I m telling you my friends. Taco Bronco   tortilla allowance.
Taco Bronco,4,This place is too good. It s next to Mickelthwait so my friend who is an omnivore loves all the meat tacos. Apparently the birria taco is phenomenal. I ve had chicken tinga tacos and nachos  I occasionally stray from the vegetarian flock   and both are awesome. I wouldn t say it s a traditional tinga  but when it tastes this good it doesn t matter really  to me  anyway . They also have some great vegetarian options  whether it s tacos  nachos  or quesadillas.
Taco Bronco,5,I went to ACL expecting to see a great performance by an artist I have never heard of  instead I discovered a great taco from a restaurant I had never heard of. I was skeptical at first because of the tortilla. It looked store bought  the worst offense for any aspiring taco place. The Barbacoa Taco proved me wrong. Any taco enthusiast knows the secrete to good barbacoa is the ratio of meat to grease. This barbacoa was so flavorful it managed to completely hide the mediocre tortilla and reduced one of the key ingredients to a taco to a simple utensil. Good job  great taco.
Taco Bronco,6,This fantastic food truck is located in the backyard of Saddle Up. They offer tacos  burritos  quesadillas  and nachos- including veggie options. My sister and I split the El Jefe burrito. It was huge and very tasty   Shredded brisket and a potato hash inside  topped with queso  sour cream  pico  and jalape os with guac on the side. Omg just typing this makes me want to go back and order another one. FYI- they only accept credit cards.
Taco Bronco,7,Spent the afternoon working at Saddle Up  great set up with WiFi  and these hit the spot at 4pm.   Great BBQ tacos  Incredible flavor combos. Meats come from the BBQ food truck next door.
Taco Bronco,8,Got take out from here with some friends and I am a happy girl. Super flavorful food  we got the El Jefe burrito  whoa buddy they are not kidding around with the size   a few tacos and a few quesadillas. So  so good 
Taco Bronco,9,Batch  home of the mouth-watering brisket kolache   amp  Micklethwait Craft Meats have taken their relationship to the next level by opening up Taco Bronco on the same lot  Austin has every kind of taco you could imagine  but Taco Bronco still manages to impress.  Their Tres Hombres plate is an awesome deal  especially for first-time visitors who can t decide what to try. For  16  you can choose 3 tacos  and it comes with chips  amp  queso  rice   amp  beans on the side. The El Jefe was the table favorite  it is Micklethwait brisket  after all . I enjoyed the Birria  lamb  as well  and it paired well with the Anaheim Chile  green  sauce. The Javelina seemed a tad dry  but luckily there was plenty of sauce options to add into the mix.  Between the kolaches  beers   amp  now Texas BBQ tacos  I expect the crowds to grow here in the next few months. Get in line while you still can 
Taco Bronco,10,My husband has been following Taco Bronco on Instagram for a bit waiting for them to open behind Batch  so we were thrilled to find out we could pop in to their soft launch this weekend.   The truck is situated behind Batch so there s plenty of room and tables  although I suspect they ll need more tables outside ASAP   and it s a great location for meeting up with a group or spending time outside.   The menu was decently sized  with six taco options  and an additional taco special  three sandwhich options   several sides  and a few nacho options as well. I was happy to see that even for a barbecue truck  there were some vegan options on the menu--well done  They even have some share platters if you re looking to do more of a barbecue experience.    My husband ordered the tres hombres platter which includes three tacos of your choice  chips with queso  rice  and beans. He picked the jefe  brisket   javelina  carnitas   and verraco  boar sausage  and we really enjoyed them all. These tacos are pretty decently sized  and packed with fillings that make them more of a meal that some other taco spots do. The brisket one included a yummy potato hash and a creamy sauce  I think that would be my go to next time for sure. Super tender  nice bark  can t beat it. The rice was good  the beans were super flavorful and a bit spicy  and chips and queso are always good around here. The meal was a great deal-- 16 total when each taco alone is  5.   Really enjoyed this meal and the service was great. Looking forward to popping in the future 
Taco Bronco,11,Taco Bronco is Tom Micklethwait s foray into tacos and the food is DELICIOUS  The meat is top quality and there s many types to choose from...brisket  carnitas  barbacoa  lamb  sausage. All smoked cooked to perfection with tons of flavor.     This food truck is in the backyard of BATCH    Tortilla game is very strong...the corn tortilla has a nice  crisp texture. I really enjoyed this part of the taco.    Each taco has generous meat filling    Whoa  salsa and BBQ sauce pairings adds an extra punch. The tamarind BBQ sauce was so good on the barbacoa mini taco     If the lamb taco is still there as a special when you go  you should definitely order it.   BBQ   TACOS   a happy marriage
Taco Bronco,12,Put down your phone and go to Taco Bronco  order the birria  smoked lamb   You are welcome.  When a spot puts Austin s two most beloved dishes into one plate  you best know I will be in line. A good BBQ taco is the perfect meal and especially at Taco Bronco.   This food truck is brought to you by the same folks as Micklethwait s Craft Meats so you know the bbq is good. I am glad to report they serve up  mean taco too.
Taco Bronco,13,Great food  Two of us shared  The Tres Hombres platter with the el Jefe  Javelina and the lamb taco special.  Loved all the tacos but the el Jefe was our favorite   Loved the beans and rice  Plenty of food for two for only  16.
Taco Bronco,14,Review  Hot new place that opened up behind Batch Craft Beer  amp  Kolaches. Highly recommended it s a must try  that being said these are not your traditional Mexican Tacos these are a BBQ meets Tex Mex mashup. I got the Tres Hombres Platter  Description Below  and was blown away by the price value and the flavor profile. The Javelina Taco was delicious the pork was juicy  flavorful  that toasted cheese took it to the next level and the pickled onions gave it a nice freshness and acidity. The Birria Taco was unique not your typical smoked lamb or consomme however their twist was still delicious  juicy and paired with their bronco sauce just elevated it. Finally my personal favorite the El Jefe Taco was pure nothing but perfect. Their brisket was on point  the potato hash was the perfect pairing and finished off with queso can t get better than that. The chips and queso were good  their rice was great and their beans were decent.  Rating  9 10  The Tres Hombres Platter  Three tacos of your choice served with rice  beans  chips and queso  The Javelina  Crispy smoked pork carnitas  mesquite roasted pecans  Bronco Sauce  toasted cheese  cilantro and pickled onion  El Jefe  Sliced brisket  cactus and potato hash topped with queso  Birria Taco  Smoked Lamb with Consomme
Taco Bronco,15,Taco Bronco has been my biggest obsession this last month. The team in there is friendly and gives you honest opinions on their food. Everything I ve had there is INCREDIBLE. Their pork and brisket tacos are my go to s there. The chicken tinga is also a great order 
Taco Bronco,16,If you ever wanted to try Micklethwait without the line  come to Taco Bronco for the meat while you still can. The master of bbq continues to impress with his masterwork at Taco Bronco.   We got a large order  2 of the family platters  a large order of barbacoa tacos and a tres hombres platter  birria  brisket and carnitas  and all I had were excellent. My thoughts   1. Pork ribs - taste just like Micklethwait - good peppery bark  good chew without being fall off the bone. No need for sauce here. 2. Brisket - smoky  pronounced smoke ring. The leaner cuts were still very good with great bark.  3. Barbacoa - the tacos are great mini bites. Just squeeze some lime on and pile on the raddish. Could use some salsa on the side though  a little dry relative to other barbacoa I ve had  4. Boar sausage - wish it had a little more fat but its still good sausage. Didn t notice gameyness at all  which is a pro  but didn t quite have the lush texture that I like with other sausage. Maybe if they had a jalepeno cheddar option... 5. Carnitas - shredded  fried pork. Also a little dry but more so has a stringier feel to it.   Their accoutrement is pretty good for what I did manage to try - I like thicker tortillas  both corn and flour   as it holds up to the bbq well. The rice and beans are fantastic - some of my favorite anywhere that has deep meaty flavor to them - almost somewhere between chili and New Orleans style red beans and rice kinda depth. Highly recommend.   Avocado is fresh and firm  radish is nicely sliced and lime wedges go well everywhere - wish I had a little bit more of all of the above  especially since they were a family platter.  Honestly  the food would have made this a 5 but I have to ding this place a star for the service. I get it  it s Sunday night  lines aren t crazy but busy and I had a large order...but uh  forgetting to give us basically most  our sides  i.e. all but 1 order of rice and beans  when you have a to go order kinda sucks. I ll take it on the chin for not checking my order before leaving  but if I paid for it  I d like to have it -.-. Not enough to deter me from coming back  but going to be mindful when I come back.   That said  go while the lines are still short 
Taco Bronco,17,Would like to try this place  I had the saved in my collections to try for a little minute. I was finally in the area and their page said open  but I called a few times and no answer. Then went to voicemail on the last call. They don t have an option to order online from their site.
Taco Bronco,18,3 Tacos 16  along with... rice  beans - that actually taste awesome.  Also...chips and queso    WTF  My fav. taco was The Javelina - it is like a cheesy pork quesadilla.  It was amazing.  The Jefe is awesome as well and a close 2cd.  I am coming again this Sunday to pretty much get the same thing I got this past Sunday because there is no line because there is not a million reviews on this place.  The place is super chill with craft brews in a bottle.  Highly recommend you check this out if you don t want a line and a badass bbq taco experience.
Taco Bronco,19,Super excited that Batch has a new food option addition  and that it s the same great BBQ  the Micklethwait owners. So we got the Tres Hombres Platter which included 3 tacos of our choice  rice beans  and chips queso for  16  plus we ordered their current special  the Lamb taco on a corn tortilla for  5. For  22  it was really impressive amount of food and I hope the portion sizes prices stay the same. We got the El Jefe  Javelina  and Barbacoa tacos and our favs were the Barbacoa and Javelina. The El Jefe  Brisket  taco was really good too  it was just a huge taco with the brisket  2 huge pieces  potatoes cactus  and queso. We ended up having to eat it deconstructed because it was hard to hold  eat and a little mushy with the queso. The only truly disappointing dish was the rice and beans. Now it s a small thing to harp on  but I love traditional BBQ sides  mac and cheese  potato salad  and beans. And I do get this is a different take on sides with just rice  beans  chips and queso as sides  but the beans weren t cooked soaked long enough and were pretty flavorless  and so was the rice. But the tacos and sides sauces were legit  we d def return to try just the BBQ or more tacos 
Taco Bronco,20,Meaty  delicious  and a great deal  We had the tres hombres with el jefe  javelina  and lamb special. Tacos were tasty and huge -- really packed with bbq and generous toppings but weren t a soggy mess. The 3 tacos   rice  beans  and chips w  queso was a deal at  16 and was a stuffed-full meal for 2. Here on a busy day not long after their grand opening and line was a little sluggish but food came out pretty quick 
Taco Bronco,21,My friends   amp  I from out of town enjoyed a great meal 2 29    Had eagerly anticipated tasting the Micklethwait craftMeat we had heard so much about.   A  slight crowd was sitting outside by 530p  So we decided to sit inside.  We went all out with the 3 meat platter   Sausage pork  brisket  sides    portions were large   we couldn t even finish it   The owner himself was  cooking  amp  we Couldn t resist waving hello   he was a regular guy    Honestly  I felt the con queso was more flavorful than the  basic  con queso AND chips we had last night at a  famous  Austin Mexican restaurant     There was a line forming  inside to purchase drinks       Wine  amp  beer The customers  amp  staff were friendly.  Thank you for true taste of Austin  
Taco Bronco,22,Okay had to post when I heard Smithville location closing.  These guys have great sausage and good brisket on their tacos.  But too much filler potatoes on the brisket signature taco makes it obvious they need to rethink it. As for the pork taco  tasted generic  same for the sides.  My lesson from this- buy mickelwaite sausages and add heb tortillas with a good citrus slaw and you can eat better at home.
Taco Bronco,23,Amazing amazing tacos  So sad they re closed because of Corona right now  I miss these tacos  Also awesome ribs and great menu 
Taco Bronco,24,I had been anticipating the opening of taco bronco for a couple months. I came opening night. I m in the food business and I understand that as far as service goes you can expect a pretty rough first night  but there is no excuse for the food to be bad. If you don t have a good product you don t open  or if it s not up to your normal standards you should tell your customers that. I had a brisket wrap around that was awful. The brisket was dry and sliced too thick. It tasted like select grade from the flat that had been refrigerated then slightly warmed. Their pulled pork taco was ok but had toppings that I don t believe were well thought out. It s pretty hard to screw up pulled pork. Their sides were nothing exciting. I only ate one bite of their vegan taco as well as everything else except the pulled pork. They don t make their own tortillas. Their sauces I m quite certain are not made from scratch it tasted like they took base sauces and tweaked them a little and called them their own. Most of all I was disappointed at the brisket they served me. I could have gotten better brisket at Dickies  and these guys are supposed to have some of the best brisket in town. It blows my mind that Eater names this place one of the top new places to eat in Austin. My only guess is that they are friends with the editor.
Taco Bronco,25,Probably my favorite restaurant in Austin. Get the Lamb special if you can  The Nachos are also insane 
Mango Feliz,1,Came on a Saturday afternoons for Yelps Trending Machine  and I was so excited to redeem my sweet Mangonada treat  In addition  when you check in to Mango Feliz  you get a free taco   The Mangonada was so delicious. Talk about cold  sweet  spicy  and juicy all in one sip  It also came with what looked like a veto paleta. Highly recommend on a warm day.  The Quesabirria taco was a HIT. Apparently it s what the food truck is know for. Meat soaked for 5-6 hours was very moist and tender. The cheese was out of this world  Definitely worth ordering at least 3.
Mango Feliz,2,These guys are participating in the Yelp  Trending Machine promotion  and despite giving away free food  their service remained top notch  I don t know how to spell the stuff I got but it was their signature frozen drink and taco  and they were delicious   Update  The drink was the Mangonada and the taco was their quesabirra taco. The quesabirra was a bit like a quesadilla  but not as crispy  filled with shredded beef and plenty of cheese  topped with onion and cilantro on a corn tortilla. I m not a corn tortilla fan  but it worked with the other flavors. It was admittedly greasy  but it wasn t huge  so it wasn t overwhelming.
Mango Feliz,3,Had my first mangonada here and it was awesome. Also got a barbacoa taco that didn t disappoint. Good stuff  This food truck shares a space with a coffee shop and has plenty of outdoor seating with large shade trees.
Mango Feliz,4,Stopped by Revival and Mango Feliz due to the Yelp Texas Trending event and I am so glad we did   I had a Mangonada  a Migas Taco  and a Bad Morning Taco.  The Bad Morning Taco is like a kitchen sink taco where they throw whatever they have laying around. Mine was incredible with black beans  eggs  bacon  and whatever other delicious goodness they had laying around.  I m sad because it was so good  but I know it is going to be different every time   The migas taco was excellent  it normally has chorizo but they were out and I love migas regardless.  The last item I tried was they Mangonada which was phenomenal. It came with a candy straw and had the heat of the chamoy tajin.  I wish it would have come with a spoon as well  but I can always ask next time.  I d highly recommend Mango Feliz and I m glad that I found a new spot that I likely wouldn t have gone out of my way to check out without the Yelp event. I ll definitely be back to see what the Bad Morning has in store for me.
Mango Feliz,5,Thanks Yelp and Mango Feliz food truck for the opportunity to try a mangonada   This was my first time trying this drink which tasted like a sweet  salty  sour tangy combination due to the chamoy and Taj n.  This drink was personally overly sweet for me  and I was a bit sad that the mango wasn t ripe but I do appreciate the fact that they used fresh mango   I also missed the taco memo so can t speak to that however if you do get the drink definitely get extra napkins or drink quickly as this can get quite sticky 
Mango Feliz,6,Holy cow the Birria taco hit the spot  The men working the truck were extremely friendly and pride themselves on the food. Everything is made fresh to order and it really shines through in the flavor. Great atmosphere and seating 
Mango Feliz,7,What a great atmosphere   Food truck located in the same area as Revival coffee. When it is a nice day out  this a great place to visit. ALSO  if you check-in  they give you a free taco  I risked the  Bad morning taco  where the cook makes whatever he she pleases. The person taking your order asks about allergies or sensitivities  very thoughtful. It was SO delicious  I also got the mangonada  which was tasty  but my teeth don t do well with cold drinks. If that isn t a concern for you  GET IT   
Mango Feliz,8,First time trying during the trending machine weekend  We were given a free mangonada  amp  free taco upon check in. I got a barbacoa taco it was fine  amp  a beautiful mangonada but it had a lot of ice. They did use paper straws which I loved but they were out of a lot of products. I got some pretty good gifts from the trending machine including a candle and a bandanna  Overall pretty good experience considering everything was gratis  I would try again when things aren t busy
Mango Feliz,9,Fun little food truck with great and creative drinks  snacks  and food. Has outdoor tables and some are shaded - mostly street parking  but a nice walk around other parts of East Austin 
Mango Feliz,10,The service was really wonderful  Very quick service. The music was wonderful  amp  I felt very comfortable sitting outside and relaxing with my drink. Due to COVID-19  I rarely try to eat inside. This venue made it easy to enjoy good music  amp  drinks outside.
Mango Feliz,11,Love the drinks here. I got the mangonada that had many chunks of mango in there along with a delicious tajin tamarind straw.
Mango Feliz,12,El Mango Feliz is fantastic  This is a true Mexican food trailer with no Tex-Mex dishes. They have Birria  which you need to try if you haven t before. It a slow cooked beef taco exclusive to Mexico. We tried Alambre  Migas  and Mrs. K. Nice spice with a combination of meats that satisfy the toughest critic  my wife. We finished with a watermelon agua fresca and the Hawaiian  Watermelon  fruit mix  and chomoy . They all were made with fresh ingredients. This place is new  but the secret won t last the way they cook 
Mango Feliz,13,I came on a Monday morning for coffee and decided to stop by. I got a Watermelon Agra Fresca that was freshly blended  large and delicious. I got 4 quesobirria tacos  and my friend got the Behana s Way Taco. Everything was spot on and came out fresh hot and delicious. The guys at the truck gave amazing service and they were responsive to my questions and just genuinely seem very proud of the food they re serving. Which they should be  because everything was delicious and the portion sizes were plenty to fill me up  I got two tacos . Be sure to give this truck a try  I ve heard great things about their specialty smoothies and I can t wait to come back and try more 
Mango Feliz,14,Waited in line and they forgot about my order. They were apologetic but still in acceptable. My daughter and I waited patiently until we noticed everyone else was getting their orders and decided to check. No good. Definitely go to grannies just around the corner next time.
Mango Feliz,15,Might be the best breakfast taco I have ever had and not 100  what was in it. The incredibly nice team cooking crushed it. I ordered the  bad day taco  aka chefs choice and it was a home run - A     from what I could tell  egg  chorizo  beans and a few other items I assume - he doesn t tell you what s in it . My wife had the veggie and loved it.   He then unprompted made us each an extra taco  one of his  off the menu  tacos that was just as good if not better. Again unsure of all ingredients as he doesn t tell his secret  pulled pork  egg  avocado and a nice medium spiced pepper .   Could not recommend this place more  and the coffee at Revival is great too    A      experience
Mango Feliz,16,I visited this place for the Yelp Machine and I was not disappointed    we got the mango ada and it was delicious  They served it to use with tamarindo on top  They were friendly and quick  We only waited about five minutes for our whole order  will definitely visit again    
Mango Feliz,17,This is one of Austin s best kept secrets. Everything on the menu is great. The breakfast tacos are especially delicious and the staff are extremely friendly too  The food yard here  adjacent to Revival Coffee  is also a really nice place to sit and eat. Definitely stop by if you re in or around East Austin.
Mango Feliz,18,Mango Feliz is a great spot for Mexican style dishes. I loved the festive drinks  the Hawaii is my favourite. Give it a try  you won t regret it.
Mango Feliz,19,This spot... is THE SPOT  Everything you get is good  I ve tried almost everything in the menu and there has not been one food drink item that I don t like   Not only is the Food AMAZING but every single staff member is super kind  which to me makes the whole experience that much more enjoyable  You have to try it when you stop by to get your REVIVAL coffee fix    100  recommend     
Mango Feliz,20,Located in the Revival Coffee courtyard  this place is bomb. We got the Migas con chorizo breakfast tacos and quesabirria taco. So good. Quick and friendly service  too.
Mango Feliz,21,This place is AMAZING     Probably some of the best authentic Mexican I ve had in Austin  The first time I went with my partner and a friend  we tried the Quesabirria  15 10 would recommend   El mango feliz bowl  watermelon aguas fresca  and the corn in a cup. NOTHING disappointed us  Everything was amazing and so fresh  Came back a second time to enjoy the quesabirria and try the el mango feliz tacos but unfortunately they were out of mango and cheese  I guess that s our fault for coming so late on a Saturday. We ordered online and when we got there to pick up our order they informed us they were out of the ingredients to make our order  but insisted they could make us something just as good  and vegan for my partner . It s safe to say that they did NOT disappoint. You can also tell the food is made with love   Will definitely be back for El Mango Feliz
Mango Feliz,22,The staff was so friendly  Very welcoming atmosphere. Super cute and quirky pink decorations. Food was excellent and got two free tacos just for leaving a review  Super chill and fun hidden places to hangout. Will definitely be going back again.
Mango Feliz,23,My partner and I visited with a few friends and the food was AMAZING  It was very authentic and exactly what we were looking for  The drinks were everything and they even looked very pretty also  Highly recommend to anyone looking for authentic Mexican food in the Austin area  
Mango Feliz,24,The best tacos in Austin  hands down. Everything on the menu is great  made fresh and on the spot. Brian  the owner  is an amazing chef and extremely creative. Try the Mr. B Taco  Alambre  Bahena s Way  any of the breakfast tacos  or anything really  You cannot go wrong 
Vaquero Taquero,1,Vaquero Taquero s story is one of vision  a mission  and a kitchen... born out a modified paleta cart pumping out  tacos chingones  just off Austin s vaunted 6th Street.  My first taste of VT was at a taco competition in San Antonio  no specialty taco here as they offered their signature campechana taco. Before the test  Miguel  one half of the brother duo from Monterrey  gave a heartfelt  rousing speech about the importance of what they were creating. All of us were moved and he was the only taquero   chef   cook who received an ovation BEFORE we dug in.   I thought it was pretty damn good. The Oaxacan cheese provided the handshake between the al pastor and bistec while the cilantro  amp  onion added that fresh component for balance. Add a roasted salsa roja and crema de aguacate and you have a stellar taco.   My friend  noticing my smile  leaned in and said  this is good but their tacos at their place are waaaaaay better.   Well damn. I guess I need to go.              My Dad is your prototypical taco eater  like I  he loves tacos but unlike I considers them value oriented  a functional plate that should only come in X for X.99 pairings. That  and my Dad frankly DGAF about a nixtamalalized corn tortilla or locally sourced ingredients  just make sure that the taco is good.  Scoffing at the 4 dollar per taco price tag  the fact they only had about 11 offerings for dinner and 5 breakfast tacos  and at the diner attention for ingredients  my Dad dubiously ordered the rings de pollo and al pastor. I could not resist the Nopales  amp  Egg and the Charro Beans y Costra de Queso offering.   Daniella was such a patient and kind server for putting up with my Dads interrogation.   Why don t you have this taco   How big are these tacos    Why are they so expensive    The tacos arrived and  impressed by the size  Pops dug in.   There was a quiet for about 5 minutes. Pops was tearing through his Al Pastor taco  he did manage to say the pineapple was great.   The nopales  amp  egg taco was pretty epic. Nopales  cactus  if overcooked can get slimy and have a bad texture. These were perfectly executed and gave the eggs an added citrusy edge. The eggs was fluffy and light  all wrapped in a gorgeous flour tortilla that had a subtle sweetness that completed the triumvirate. What a badass taco.   VT s take on the classic bean  amp  cheese taco was even better. Using the same Queso Oaxacan cheese from before  they seared it onto the nixtamalalized corn tortilla and then adding frijoles charros. Even though the beans were not loaded with bacon and chicharron like I like them  the flavor profile was still dense  the beans were soft and cooked like mom s back home. The VT Charro Beans  amp  Costra de Queso is the Bean  amp  Cheese taco  elevated.  I looked at my Dad who had finished his tacos. Pops was satisfied but I wanted to make sure.   Y qu  tal los tacos Pa     Est n chigones mijo...   One of my favorite IG stories ever...                  Vaquero Taquero won the hearts of everyone at that judges table at the San Antonio Taco Rumble. VT also won some bragging rights at the competition being among the top tacos at the event  but won the biggest prize of them all  convincing an old Mexican man that yes  you can charge more than a dollar or two for a taco... and for that I d say Vaquero Taquero is the People s Champ of Taqueria s  para la gente y la cultura.
Vaquero Taquero,2,Stopped by because it was in walking distance of our hotel. I had 3 tacos  chicken tinga  beef  and pastor. The pastor was the only one with much flavor. The rest were quite bland. I m sure there s better options for tacos in Austin.    Theres a large homeless encampment right next to the restaurant. This does not bother me personally  but could be worrisome for others.
Vaquero Taquero,3,Our second time here  good tacos bad service   They literally have two servers working the whole restaurant  so they won t welcome you or ask you what you want to drink. You will have to order everything online and pick up your food. Again this is the second time here same experience   If you need water you have to get up and get it  and after 10 00 pm they only sell pastor  pork meat  so if your vegetarian this is not the pace for you
Vaquero Taquero,4, 11 3 22 Visit  We had just got into town and walked here from our hotel in downtown. We had a great experience and enjoyed a leisurely late lunch. It was slow around 2 45pm when we went  only a few other customers. They had some taco specials and drink specials. The Al Pastor Tacos were on special so I ordered a couple of those and rice and beans. Everything was so delicious  Loved the pineapple and avocado cream in the Al Pastor  We had a couple of cocktails and our server Allen was the best. He was so attentive and answered all our questions about Austin. Time flew by and we realized we had been there almost two hours. Amazing meal and service 
Vaquero Taquero,5,Some very solid breakfast tacos coming from this place...stopped by Saturday before the pecan street festival...Friendly and fast service...tacos were piping hot and the sauce was great.
Vaquero Taquero,6,The Breakfast tacos are ... ungood Which is seriously sad   cos their  regular  tacos are amazeballs.  OK  to be precise  their  regular  tacos at they original establishment are definitely amazeballs  but here  not so much.  Then again  if you ve spent the last while getting hammered on 6th  why    this probably works...
Vaquero Taquero,7,Loved the Al Pastor and Ting de Pollo tacos. Also really enjoyed the chips and roja salsa. Bistec was kind of plain and definitely not a fan of cactus after trying it.
Vaquero Taquero,8,My boyfriend and I came here before hitting a show down the road at Mohawk. We were looking for the pub that used to be in this location  but Vaquero Taquero did not disappoint    Highlights for me were the nopales  cactus  taco and the chicken tinga quesadilla. Their tortillas are made fresh to order  we saw the chef pressing them in the back   which made them buttery and delicious.  I think these are some of the best tacos downtown  easy.  As a side note  I feel like it s important to mention that this is one of those places that uses QR code ordering - there was one employee that was delivering food and answering questions  but otherwise no waiters.
Vaquero Taquero,9,The Al pastor taco is fantastic  I love the fresh julienned pineapple. The mole taco kinda sucked though. Service was good  but the place smelt like rotten eggs. Hey  it s dirty 6th. Would love to come back for more pastor  it s some of the best I have had.
Vaquero Taquero,10,Great food but TERRIBLE service. Like top 3 worst service ever. Did self order at table  that s only option   got a text good was ready. 20 minutes later still never had any food  came with 5 people . Asked a waiter passing by where my food was  brought me my cold tacos right away - clearly they were sitting in the back and were forgotten about. Entire group had same issues. Including forgotten drinks we paid for and we re on our order via app. Left frustrated and hungry but didn t want to order more because of the terrible service.  Don t use app service if wont support customers who use it. Very disappointed.
Vaquero Taquero,11,These tacos were phenomenal    Homemade corn tortillas were amazing and the Al pastor taco was to die for. Literally I needed this after visiting the clubs nearby  but I would come here any time. The bartender made me an amazing Paloma. And it s reasonably priced. Selena playing in the background  it was perfect.
Vaquero Taquero,12,The electronic only ordering app wouldn t let my   tech savvy  friend finish his order The three frustrated people ahead of us cheered when they got through I diddnt even try.. we left
Vaquero Taquero,13,In for a conference downtown and ordered from Vaquero  via Uber Eats  after my taco order from another spot was canceled. This might ve been the absolute worst experience I ve had with any establishment through an online platform. For context  I travel A LOT and have quite a bit of experience in this arena.   When I opened my initial order in my hotel room  I was a bit annoyed that I received an entirely different plate. Clearly someone else s order -- but it happens  right  I alerted UberEats to the issue with my order  they took care of it  and I was able to reorder my initial ticket since Vaquero was still open. Perfect.   Well  my second order came -- and it was still wrong. I have a gluten allergy and requested corn tortillas on all items  I received 2 corn  1 flour. I ordered a nopales and egg taco and received a completely different nopales taco that was too over salted to be edible. The quesadilla I ordered never came. And to top it off  the meat in my steak taco was 50  fat gristle. After taking  and spitting out  three consecutive bites  I gave up. Unfortunately  Vaquero has lost my business for good.
Vaquero Taquero,14,Hands down best taco s I have had in ATX  Thanks to my buddy Miguel for showing me this great spot  Gotta try the Nopales Cactus Tacos 
Vaquero Taquero,15,I was lucky to have my first taste of Vaquero Taquero through a surprise bag from the TooGoodToGo app  I didn t expect them to be so generous  but I received rice  charro beans  two large tacos  one cochinito  one al pastor   chips and a choice of salsa  I chose the vaquero salsa. The staff was so incredibly friendly and the food was amazing  Juicy  and I love that they didn t skimp and give me a tiny lime slice like most places do. My lime was J U I C Y  The salsa was unlike most salsa I ve had at restaurants but in a good way  it was very fresh and I could tell they made it in house and didn t freeze it or anything. It packed a really great amount of heat while not sacrificing in flavor either. I will be coming back for sure 
Vaquero Taquero,16,Fantastic authentic Food  horrible service. Also the amount homeless people here are too much that makes me feel uncomfortable. There needs to be better security here and more servers to provide  better clarity on how to order food. Also how does it make sense that I have to make an alcoholic order inside if I want to eat and drink outside. On top of the above  I didnt want to be inside because area stunk like mold as if they were cleaning with an old mop.
Vaquero Taquero,17,So good  Not a lot on the menu so you know you can t go wrong with anything you get  so fresh too  Highly recommend 
Vaquero Taquero,18,My friends and I stopped here after our time around 6th street and it did not disappoint at all. We had really good service from the worker  he was super nice to us and made conversation with us. We were a little skeptical on the food  mainly when trying to find authentic food like this  but It was so good  Side note  You order food from the kiosk and order drinks at the bar. They do stop serving at a certain time I believe. Overall  I will come back again. We loved it
Vaquero Taquero,19,Awesome food    Chips and salsa were underwhelming but not bad.  Tacos and quesadillas... awesome    I recommend the al pastor and chicken mole  but the tinga de pollo was good too.  Very casual ambiance and the staff are really nice.
Vaquero Taquero,20,Friendly service and salsa that I am still thinking about.  Their tinga quesadilla was soooo amazing   
Vaquero Taquero,21,I was in town for a work conference  and my colleagues and I were done with conference food and decided to abandon the hotel for a nearby taco spot. I asked a good friend for the best tacos we could walk to  and she recommended we try Vaquero Taquero. I m so glad she did  The restaurant is casual and cool. The service was good. Ordering was easy  online using a QR code on all the tables . But it s all about the food  right  All four of us had tacos and shared their guacamole and salsa sampler. The guac was great. The salsas were excellent. I was mmmmmmmmmming while eating my tacos  al pastor and chicken mole . They have veg options  they make their own corn and flour tortillas in house  and they make agua frescas in house. All of us enjoyed what we ordered. It s local  family-owned  started as a taco truck run by two brothers . I have no complaints. It was just great. I d eat there again right now if I hadn t already left Austin. Definitely looking forward to a future visit for more tacos.
Vaquero Taquero,22,I had the nopal tacos  delicious   they accommodated and did not include the dairy  and it was great  super delicious  I enjoyed the chill vibes and had great service 
Vaquero Taquero,23,The tacos were amazing   We ordered the salsa trio and all of them had so much flavor  and good heat . We followed it up with the al pastor  bistec  nopales  and tinga tacos. It was really hard to pick a favorite. All of them were truly delicious. They were big too  This is a serious go-to taco spot.
Vaquero Taquero,24,I stumbled onto Vaquero Taquero during the day on 6th and was really pleasantly surprised. The tacos were legit and there were a ton of vegetarian and vegan options. The tortillas are homemade  and the prices are definitely reasonable. I tried the tinga de pollo  shredded chicken in sauce  and the rajas poblanas  sauteed poblanos  mushrooms  onions  and cheese   the mushroom mole  unreal  mushrooms in chile mole sauce   and the nopales  sauteed cactus . The salsas were also really fresh and flavorful. They also do a mezcal tasting if you re looking for a date night or somewhere to take a visitor. Definitely try this place out 
Vaquero Taquero,25,Doesn t look like much but the al pastor tacos are THE best I ve ever had. The bistek tacos are also delicious  Ordered the chips and salsa and was pleasantly surprised with a selection of 3 salsas  each one so delicious. Great service too  highly recommend 
Vaquero Taquero,26,Tacos were amazing  Staff is very friendly. We got the salsa trio and a few tacos each. Very satisfying.
Vaquero Taquero,27,Kind of disappointing I came here for birria taco and theyre unvalable. But anyway  the al pastor  bistic  chikcken mole. Theyre really good  but the sauces are ok. We wanted to tried the chips and salsa that comes with 3 salsa  they served us the OLD chips  and the salsa are just ok  just kind of disappointed especially the chips  We wanted to tell then but the guy and the girl just too busy talking that they dont hear us with their loud music.
Vaquero Taquero,28,One of the best taco places in town   Good quality  excellent taste  and great service. 100  will come back.   
Vaquero Taquero,29,Great tacos to go  pleasantly surprised. Fresh ingredients and firm tortillas that didn t get soggy.
Vaquero Taquero,30,The food was SO good. But the ordering process makes it not worth going in my opinion  especially for drinks. You order food on your phone first  which is usually fine  but some of our orders were brought out to us  while some were left at the bar at a pick-up sign. There didn t seem to be any rhyme or reason as to which one you were suppose to know was at the bar.   Then you order drinks on a separate kiosk that kept glitching  and a line forms because it is one at a time  which takes even longer. It just didn t make much sense because there were 3 people working the bar and only a handful of people in the restaurant when we arrived. It wasn t until after multiple attempts to get the kiosk to work that they let us order at the bar  but they seemed super unfamiliar with this process  so this also took awhile. When it came time to order another drink we decided to just go somewhere else.  On top of it all  there was a DJ that blasted his made-for-a-music-festival speakers at maximum volume on this tiny little patio to where every single table outside left  and two other tables   us moved inside and closed the patio doors because it was physically painful.  Overall maybe just pick up the food or go to their OG location until they come around to a more streamlined way of ordering things. This felt like a futuristic-mess-of-a-way to order food and drinks.
Vaquero Taquero,31,Tacos were amazing got the pastor  great flavor tenderness was great  Highly recommend this taco shop 
Vaquero Taquero,32,Omg     A hidden gem that you MUST try    Do not walk by without having a taste of quesadillas and tacos. I ei definitely be back when I m in town  
Vaquero Taquero,33,My number one taco place. Hole in the wall taqueria. The fresh-made corn tortillas are an excellent complement to the al pastor. Al pastor taco is very balanced  whereas the campachana was a lot more on the savory side. Red sauce is the best salsa they have.
Vaquero Taquero,34,Excellent al pastor and rajas con queso tacos  These tacos are top notch  BUT it should be pointed out that these tacos are not as good as their original location. The tortillas don t taste as fresh and flavors just weren t what they usually are compared to the og location. Also  Porfis  notice that the hours are listed incorrectly as 9pm-10pm. They are obviously open 9am-10pm. TLDR  tacos are great  but not as good as their original location. Hours on yelp are incorrect.
Vaquero Taquero,35,Food was great. The vegetarian taco options were the most interesting and tasty. As a diehard meat eater and visiting from Socal  I was a little disappointed with the meat offering  so in addition to the al pastor  I tried the nopales and pablano tacos  Service was welcoming and attentive. No complaints. Ps Great Creme Brule.
Vaquero Taquero,36,Best tacos in Austin. You won t be disappointed with the quality  service and just overall experience. Vaquero Taquero offers authentic Al Pastor tacos with fresh made tortillas at a reasonable price.
Vaquero Taquero,37,Try the beans and the nopales. Best place in Austin for both things. Also the owners are legit Mexicans so the flavor is like been in Mexico in the heart of downtown Austin
Vaquero Taquero,38,Amazing food and service   Homemade corn and flour tortillas. We will definately be back.
Vaquero Taquero,39,The best tacos al pastor outside of Mexico  I got a regular taco al pastor and a gringa. I recommend the gringa if you only get one.
Vaquero Taquero,40,Tacos are to diiieee for. Really quick service and super cool owner too. This place is an absolute must.
Vaquero Taquero,41,Excellent South Texas style Tacos. Bistec  Tinga de Pollo and breakfast tacos are my favorites. Both flour and corn tortillas are house made and delicious  so can t go wrong with either.
Vaquero Taquero,42,They have some of the best tacos in Austin  always fresh ingredients and very polite staff.
OneTaco Taquería,1,Breakfast tacos  Breakfast tacos  Breakfast tacos   Holy crap these are great. It s possible I went to this location twice and each time was dynamite.
OneTaco Taquería,2,This was recommended by a Lyft driver and was just okay.  I got the Al Pastor taco  horchata  and chips with salsa.  My friend and I stopped in about 30 minutes before closing which may explain why the pastor was dried out. It was sad to look at and eat. However  the pineapple was fresh and not canned.   Horchata tasted like a liquified churro to me and I enjoyed it. My friend found it too sweet for her taste.   The chips came in a transparent plastic bag with a Best Buy date stamped on it. The salsa was flavorful and on the spicy side.
OneTaco Taquería,3,Definitely doesn t look like anything if you walk past it in the day time but I m sure this place gets packed during the evenings and weekends.   Decided to come for breakfast and let s just say one taco isn t enough  These tacos definitely brought the flavor and I wished I could have ordered one more but I was full off the two I got.  I love Bacon  amp  The Migas .   There was no wait for me to place my order and it took about 8 mins to receive  in addition to the tacos you will receive complimentary salsa which dope.  My order was only about 8 bucks which in this day and age seems unheard of.   I would definitely come back and try other things.
OneTaco Taquería,4,Came here because the famous guy said it was good and unique. The interior is very nice and simple and clean but the food just wasn t over the top like I expected. Price was high for something that just didn t taste over the top meat was a little dry. But all the taco competition in Austin this is definitely at the bottom.
OneTaco Taquería,5,This place is a MUST try  It s linked to the sports bar and service is amazing AND QUICK  I ordered too many tacos to even remember lol. Everything was soooooo good  U loved the carne asada  al pastor  and the pollo.
OneTaco Taquería,6,Visiting Austin. Walked over from the JW Marriott. So good. Awesome vibe and delicious tacos. We are coming back tomorrow. That good.
OneTaco Taquería,7,My friends and I were staying at a hotel a few blocks away so we got something quick to eat here out of convenience. I had the CARNE ASADA taco and the amount of meat was generous  moist  and flavorful  I was very pleasantly surprised because I usually check out a restaurant before choosing whether to eat there or not  but someone else chose this place so I was going in blind. It was maybe the best steak taco I ve ever had...it blew me away  My bf had the carne asada and the POLLO ASADO and felt the same as me about the quality of these tacos. He later told me he  forgot  to offer me a bite of his pollo asado taco because it was so good it was gone before he could remember  eyeroll  I ll definitely come back and get one for myself so he doesn t have to use such a lame excuse not to share these delicious tacos lol
OneTaco Taquería,8,Authentic Mexican food from Baja Mexico- blows Tex-mex out the door  Location is kinda secluded but in the downtown area. Must go for great tacos and brewchatta  Starbucks doesn t offer brewchatta   
OneTaco Taquería,9,I ve never gotten a street taco so fast after placing an order. Yes it s a building but the quality is on par with those street vendors we ve come to love so much. Prices are dirt cheap and the meat was so juicy when it came out. We got it to go but after smelling it we just ate it right there. Ate too fast  forgot to take pictures of the food
OneTaco Taquería,10,In an effort to try the best tacos in the area and an option listed on DDD  we dropped in on a Saturday night.  This location is on the east side of a downtown building off of Brazos Street.  It seemed all of the parking spots along the streets were taken so we resorted to a parking garage   10  just a block south of the restaurant.  When you walk inside the small space  there is a island bar that customers sit at to eat or wait for their order to come out.  You place your order at the counter to the right  below 2 TV monitors with the menu of options.  Seating is minimal.  They do have a few picnic-style table and bench options that fit 2 people and a couple that tightly seat 4.  We ordered large Guacamole and Chips   5.50   8 oz  to share.  The chips came in a sealed plastic bag and they were fine.  The guac was somewhat chunky and one of the better batches we have had at a restaurant.  All of the tacos we ordered were generously filled.  Three of us ordered the Relax   3.75   which included black beans  avocado  and queso fresco on a flour tortilla.  It was pretty good.  I also tried the Migas   3.50   a breakfast taco they offer all day that s filled with scrambled eggs  avocado  cheese and pico.  I would order it again.  My wife had the Liflower   4.50   filled with grilled cauliflower  crispy onions and queso fresco on a corn tortilla and she said it was good.  My son did the Norte   4.95 - steak  queso  avocado sauce   Pollo Asado   3.95 - grilled chicken  cheese  chipotle sauce   and Jefe   3.75 - fried egg  steak  black beans and pico .  He said he liked the Norte the best  which they do indicate on their menu that it s a popular option.  So overall  they offer pretty good and well filled tacos at reasonable prices  although not necessarily set up to accommodate basically any-sized groups for dining in.
OneTaco Taquería,21,Really solid tacos   Gringa taco was delicious. Friendly staff and fast. Would highly recommend.
OneTaco Taquería,22,Basic street tacos made fast. Everything is tasty. They lean more traditional than other Austin tacos  and the menu isn t as large  but you can count on this place for consistent quality and convenience
OneTaco Taquería,23,During my Austin Breakfast Taco Tour  I was lucky enough to stumble upon OneTaco Taqueria. The composition of their taco was wonderful  a layer of beans on the tortilla  a flat scrambled egg patty as if it were a second tortilla  and then meat and topping wrapped in that. As shown in the picture below  the food was too good to wait for a photo.
OneTaco Taquería,24,Came here multiple mornings for breakfast while staying at a hotel down the street. Love the breakfast tacos and horchata.
OneTaco Taquería,25,Wow  Was looking for a last meal in Austin before catching the flight back home and I am so happy I chose this spot. The carne asada taco was the best taco I ve had in my life and I still think about it every time I m craving Mexican food.
OneTaco Taquería,26,Best traditional tacos are the carne asada and al pastor  Its not easy finding good traditional tacos in tx after having them in mx but this place is a must when in Austin 
OneTaco Taquería,27,Ate here Saturday night. Noticed halfway through my taco that the chicken was undercooked. Spent all day Sunday with food poisoning. Didn t leave my restroom.  Steak from now on.
OneTaco Taquería,28,All I can say is wow  Some of the best tacos I ve ever had. Each bit left me wanting more. Will definitely be back the next time I m in Austin.
OneTaco Taquería,29,Had the jefe taco and omg the salsa and taco was sooooo GOOD cant wait to try the evening tacos by far one of the best tacos I ve ate in Austin
OneTaco Taquería,30,I got the buenos dias and it was a damn good taco  Also great customer service and came out fast
OneTaco Taquería,31,I have been a big fan of One Taco for a few years now and I m so happy that they opened the new DOWNTOWN LOCATION at the Frost tower    You can definitely tell that there is care put into every single taco and the flavors are always spot on. Their menu and tacos remind me of the street tacos I would eat back home in Mexico after a fun night out. My favorite taco by far is the Gringa  which is a combination of marinated pork with cheese and pineapple which is reminiscent of the traditional  al pastor  tacos native to Mexico. They also have home made aguas frescas that are delicious and their guacamole and queso is hard to beat.   I can t stop coming back to One Taco and I know that every time I m there I feel at home and like family 
OneTaco Taquería,32,Delicious tacos  amp  friendly staff. Indoor  amp  outdoor seating available. Some tacos featured on Diners Drive Ins and Dives which is also cool. Highly recommend.
OneTaco Taquería,33,Best breakfast tacos     They re all great- kids will live the pancake taco too  We had the micas  and chorizo. They re amazing 
OneTaco Taquería,34,I love One Taco  but today I walked by this very window-friendly location  wearing my mask in 100 degree heat  and the cook was right there in full view wearing a mask...on his neck. No thanks.
OneTaco Taquería,35,Amazing service  I definitely recommend the Campechana tacos a filled with lots of meat.
OneTaco Taquería,36,This is hands-down the worst breakfast tacos I ve ever had in my life.  Saw them making it and was just perplexed to what was going on.  Ordered a potato bacon and cheese breakfast taco and this is what I received after they remade it.  The first order had about half the amount of ingredients.  I wish I would ve double checked the remade order and realize that they still forgot to put cheese on taco.  The only reason I didn t recheck the order is I was approaching the 30 min mark of being at the empty spot and just had to go.
OneTaco Taquería,37,I d love to give this company even more stars for their incredible customer services  and the food is pretty darn delicious too.     I submitted a company order  my tacos were missed - they hand delivered my missing tacos     I couldn t believe it  who does that  Nobody else downtown I ve purchased food from will do that  but One Taco did because they are awesome.  The people who work here are a special bunch  empathetic  amp  kind .  This was my first time ordering from them and I ll definitely order from them again and again and again and again.............  o 
OneTaco Taquería,38,the best Asada Tacos i tried in a long time Al Pastor are muy ricos I tried Carne Asanda and Taco Norte tacos  and a Campechana i stole from my wife  there s tables for you to seat or eat standing just like taquer as.  great vibe it took me back as if i was in an Authentic Taquer a some where in Mexico
OneTaco Taquería,39,Delicious tacos. Best tacos I have had in Austin. Thanks  I usually get them from the taco truck 
OneTaco Taquería,40,Spicy taco is very spicy  which is a plus if you like very spicy tacos. Cactus taco also excellent. Fast service. Generous seating. One taco to rule them all.
Veracruz All Natural,1,A fun place to stop by whether by yourself or with little ones. Littlefield consist of a taco stand  coffee stand  and snow cone stand on the weekends.  This food at Veracruz is fresh and flavorful. The tacos come well proportioned with a wide selection of meat and vegan options. The watermelon agua Fresca is refreshing and comes in a huge cup - great value.   The line can be long on the weekends  but we ll worth it. There is also a playground for kids while we wait for the food.
Veracruz All Natural,2,I love this location. It has a cute kids play area but parking may be a nightmare  you can park in the neighborhood around the block .   The great thing about this location is there s ample seating and they have a full menu including a ton of drink options  their drinks have no sugar option which is perfect for the health conscious  also their smoothies aren t that sweet either .  I ve tried an assortment of their tacos and I ll be honest  some of the tacos are just average  like the shrimp or steak taco  and honestly the only taco you should be ordering is the grilled fish taco. It s bursting with flavor and with the included sauce  it is literally the best taco I ve ever had. Trust me I ve tried to branch away from the tried and true but the other tacos are just mid  the meat ones are overly salty imo .  Just come here and get 2-3 fish tacos and an agua fresca or smoothie to set your day straight. Thank me later.
Veracruz All Natural,3,Best breakfast tacos in Austin I think. Way more ingredients and filling than Taco Shack. Way higher quality than Rudy s. About the same size as Torchy s but not greasy  not even the chorizo   and you feel like actually living your life after eating it.   The ordering system makes sense for them but could be challenging if you re not expecting it. It is all credit cards and on a tablet at the front. They text you when your order is ready. Feels like printing a boarding pass at the airport. Next time I ll try and make an order online and just show up and see if I can bypass the line which was about 10 minutes altogether. Not bad.
Veracruz All Natural,4,I remember when VAN was on Cesar Chavez and operated out of a feed truck.  It s close to a couple Mexican party stores where I pick up pi atas for birthdays  Halloween  thanksgiving  weddings- pretty much any event.  It s amazing to see grown adults playing whack a mole in a blindfold.  It s also a Mexican tradition that guests from other parts of the country or world love to try for the first time. I fill them with small liquor samples and other adult toys  nudge  nudge .  I digress.....The next VAN I found was off east 7th street  another food truck.  Loved the food  but hated the long lines.  Next was north near Burnett and 183 - brick a mortar.  I took the family and many guests there.  It was a sad day when COVID closed this beauty.  Next I saw VAN in the food truck court at the farmers market in Mueller Park. What a great way to spend a Sunday morning browsing the farmers market with a VAN taco in my hand.  Next I found the food truck near Winsor and MOPAC.  It s located in a small park with a Medici coffee truck. A great place to unwind in the morning.  Lots of kids playing and digital nomads working. Finally  I was surprised to find VAN when visiting a friend at a hotel on Cesar Chaves downtown.  I guess you can tell  I m a fan of VAN- consistent excellent food  well managed- I really can t get enough of them.  PS - my favorite is Poblano Migas.
Veracruz All Natural,5,Such.a beautiful and peaceful outdoor dining area   They even have a playground next to it with natural shades from a big tree.   The tacos are amazing  We tried chips  guacamole  el diferente taco  the potatoes are to die for    shrimp macha taco  grilled fish taco  tasted healthier than fried fish and fresh in seafood taste   grilled chicken taco  the chicken is so flavorful by itself    grilled steak taco  el pastor taco.  The drinks are  6 a cup but huge size and the hibiscus tea is always my go to and it s refreshing    Definitely recommend 
Veracruz All Natural,6,5 stars for the food  minus one star for customer service.   First of all  they have Really incredible tacos. best in austin. Probably best in the world. I always get migas and the traditional breakfast taco. Their red salsa is phenomenal.   Parking was limited  so I had to go back into a neighborhood but not a big deal.   Regarding The reason I gave 4 stars  this is because I had a lot of issues with trying to redeem a gift card. I got the gift card in 2020 December and shortly after they changed ordering systems. I was not able to redeem my giftcard at multiple locations for years  and had to finally call text customer support. They arranged and accommodated my request but it took longer than I would have liked - almost 45 minutes.
Veracruz All Natural,7,Tacos are basically the official food of Austin. When a Californian arrives as part of the tech exodus  they get their new Texas license in one hand and a taco  or two  in the other. Veracruz is going to be the taco place I recommend to that next transplant.  There s a variety of options that ll please everyone  maybe not the no corn  no flour  no meat  no egg person . Highly recommend the Dona Reyna and the El Breakfast is a classic for those new to tacos. Personally I found the barbacoa a little too mushy. Definitely add your red and green salsas  they pack a punch  hell I can t wait for HEB to carry the Veracruz All Natural Salsas next month  oh yeah  Californians  You will love HEB. HEB is love. HEB is life .  PARKING  Can be busy  there s a few spots in the parking lot  but you ll have to get lucky. Plenty of street parking  though sometimes you ll have to park around the corner  which can suck when it s hot out.  LINE  The wait is a little deceptive. The line might look short non-existent  but if you see a lot of folks bumming around without food  you can bet they re waiting for their tacos. Personally  I feel the wait is shorter during the weekdays even when there are more cars.  AREA  Walled area with a decent grassy area. There s also a coffee stall and snowcone stall in the same area. A counter seating area and several park tables. A small playground  which is great for folks with small children.   I give Veracruz All Natural 4 meme-tweeting tech billionaire CEOs  out of 5.
Veracruz All Natural,8,Vera Cruz tacos are some of my favorite in all of Austin. I bring all my friends and family here and they are always blown away. Our all time favorites are  Migas  no cheese  and El Diferente.
Veracruz All Natural,9,Their barbacoa is unreal. So many other good tacos. They have a number of good spots in Austin. My favorite is in Tarrytown with some good coffee. Speed of service has been better lately  but worth the wait.
Veracruz All Natural,10,This would be a nice place to catch up with friends. The seating area was reminiscent of a picnic area and was very chic. There were plenty of shaded areas and seating areas.  There was extremely limited parking space. Approximately only 5-6 parking spaces were for customers. The rest of the parking lot was for the apartment next door. Additionally  street parking was filled.   There were two food trucks  Medici Coffee and Veracruz All Natural food truck. We ordered a guacamole and chips  the food truck sells chips separately  and tacos.  You could taste that the guacamole was made from very fresh ingredients. However  it was very bland and needed at least some salt and lime. The chips were average.   The shrimp macha taco was interesting. The shrimp was perfectly cooked  and the flour tortilla was slightly toasted. However  the salsa macha tasted burnt and charred. It ruined the rest of the taco.
Veracruz All Natural,11,This food truck is located in a small plaza next to a neighborhood off of MoPac. They serve tacos as well as a variety of different drinks. These breakfast tacos are definitely elite  some of the best I ve had in Austin so far.  Along with the two pictured  we also ordered the Chorizo breakfast taco  the cantaloupe agua fresca  as well as the mango one. The agua frescas were super refreshing and you can really taste the fruit. I highly recommend getting either flavor. The potato and egg taco was my favorite  as the potatoes are seasoned perfectly and the eggs were so fluffy and cloud-like. The tortillas also have a nice chewy texture. Their red salsa is pretty spicy and the salsa verde is very creamy and delicious. The two pair very well together   Veracruz All Natural is definitely worth a visit if you are craving breakfast tacos. 4.5 5 stars
Veracruz All Natural,12,My friends had been hyping up Veracruz for a long time and I was finally able to try them myself. I got the barbacoa and al pastor taco. Both were greasy  in a good way . The standout for me had to be the barbacoa. The meat was SO good and SO soft and just delicious all around. I was too scared to add salsa in case I ruined the already flavorful taco. I also ordered a mango agua fresca which was super refreshing. This Veracruz location is super cute and is right next to Medici if you want coffee was well 
Veracruz All Natural,13,This is a super cute taco stand with lots of seating and a great atmosphere. You order on an iPad so you know exactly what you are getting and then you receive a text when your food is ready. The vegan nacho dip is delicious along with the Barbacoa taco  The staff was a bit rude when we asked for salsa but it was also pretty busy.
Veracruz All Natural,14,Come to Veracruz for the most amazing  fresh tacos for breakfast and lunch. And on a hot day don t forget the smoothies and agua frescas. During peak times on weekday mornings  order ahead on the app to avoid long wait times.
Veracruz All Natural,15,I ve always recommended this place to visitors and residents of Austin. The tacos here are fantastic  My favorite is the Migas Poblanas taco. I ve also tried the pastor  but it was a bit too greasy for my taste. The location is cute and there is plenty of seating. Also a Medici coffee conveniently placed in the area as well if you d like some coffee to go with your delicious tacos. I much prefer this location over the one in the Line hotel on SoCo.
Veracruz All Natural,16,This is such a hidden gem   The outdoor seating area is SO CUTE and they have both veracruz tacos and a Medici food truck so it s perfect for some tacos and coffee  They have vegan tacos too that are labeled on the menu that were super delicious   
Veracruz All Natural,17,A perfect trip to Austin  day one arrive and try the highly coveted migas taco from the widely recognized Veracruz All Natural. Discover it lives up to the reputation and spend the rest of your trip eating Veracruz every day.   Above was a quick summary of the rapid ascent of my love for Veracruz which blissfully has locations all over the city. Get the migas poblanos taco on a flour tortilla. This massive and magical mess of eggs  cheese and tortilla chips is so much more than the sum of its parts and doused in salsa. It s got the chewy tortilla  crispy chips  and some fresh chili and bean action to cut through the heftiness of the normal miegas situatin.  I ve also tried the migas  al pastor  grilled fish and the Cochinita Pibil tacos. All are delicious  the cochinita pibil was a steller taco  crisped up on the plancha and succulent pulled pork. And plantains  yum   The line and wait for this location are pretty standard  usually a line that moves fast  but you end up waiting about 15 minutes for your tacos so you should prep for that in advance. But don t let that hold you back 
Veracruz All Natural,18,Best migas I ve ever had I used to eat three while I watched the spurs at the grackle now I travel all the way up north to get them
Veracruz All Natural,19,I used to love Veracruz at Littlefields but my last visit was super disappointing. In 2021 I went no less than 10 times and enjoyed it every time. However  last month my perception of them came crashing down.   Not only were the tacos  50  more expensive across the board - some nearly  6 per taco - the speed and service were atrocious. There was a new girl with braces at the register who clearly does not have a calling for service. After taking my order with zero enthusiasm  I waited 20 min for my food. The 3 parties after me got their food  but mine hadn t come - so I asked her to check. She annoying responds with   they re working on it  - clearly she has no idea - and I wait another 10 min before asking again. By this time  it s clear they lost my order. I finally get them to put in the order again  before getting my tacos another 10 min later.   Word of advice to Veracruz - replace this girl asap  if she continues the face of your taco truck  you will hemorrhage loyal customers.  Maybe some of your customers can handle the higher prices  but the service is harder to stomach.
Veracruz All Natural,20,Service is slow but worth the wait because it s so popular that the line is long ass sh t. Tacos are fire and the  gua frescas are tasty.
Veracruz All Natural,21,Rude service. Also very first order of the day apparently still takes 30 min. Tacos are good but not good enough for that kind of service and wait time
Veracruz All Natural,22,This is hands down one of my favorite taco places in Austin  and austin has a lot of great taco places. If you are from out of town...you need to experience a breakfast taco in Texas and this is a great place to do it. If you are from Austin  you have probably already heard of this place. The migas taco has avocado and eggs and tortilla chips in the taco...magical combo...I know. They also have 2 sauces  the red one is more spicy than the green one . You can also pick between flour and corn tortillas. This location has a nice little outdoor patio area shader by the other food trucks in the patio area.
Veracruz All Natural,23,Very tasty shrimp tavo at a reasonable price  Be crFul  salsa is verily spicy. Was better without
Veracruz All Natural,24,I kept driving by  Littlefield s Tacos and Coffee   thinking it looked cute.  After googling it I realized the tacos are Veracruz All Natural and I ve heard great things about it but had never had the chance to try them.  So happy that I decided to stop in today.  I ordered online and tacos were ready when I arrived  so easy   Today I tried the Migas taco and bacon  egg and cheese  both were outstanding.  So flavorful  fresh ingredients and YUMMY salsa.  The tortillas seem homemade  and were perfect.  I may go back tomorrow... I just grabbed tacos and headed out but the little outdoor area to sit and enjoy your food is really nice and looks like a relaxing spot to enjoy coffee and tacos.
Veracruz All Natural,25,Some of the best tacos you can get in Austin. The Migas Taco and the Al Pastor are unbelievable. It s connected to a great coffee shop  so this is a fantastic place to grab breakfast or lunch while getting some work done. Beautiful outdoor space too.
Veracruz All Natural,26,I tried the shrimp taco and am proud to say i ate at this fine establishment. They r dog friendly and have an area with building blocks for kids. Unfortunately  i forgot to take a picture of the taco because it so yummy.  bad yelper
Veracruz All Natural,27,Super friendly staff and delicious breakfast tacos    Would eat these every morning if I could. Not to mention fresh squeezed juice  The Winsted Ln location is also in a super cute area with create music and fun seating. Coffee shop right next door too 
Veracruz All Natural,28,Always great food. One of the best for Al Pastor. Been to several different locations and never had any problems.
Veracruz All Natural,29,Easily my favorite tacos in Austin. There aren t a ton of vegetarian options  but the migas taco is so good I ve never thought twice about it. I even got my mom to admit that the vegan queso is good  and she s vehemently anti-vegan cheese. If you re in Austin and don t go to Veracruz  you re missing out.
Veracruz All Natural,30,Very rude service and mediocre tacos. I ordered two tacos and they gave them to me without tortillas. When I asked for tortillas she refused to give them to me and made me pay another  1.50 and wait in line to get two tortillas. Very rude and unprofessional. Burnt eggs too
Veracruz All Natural,31,Amazing Amazing Amazing tacos from a food stand at Littlefield complex in Tarrytown. The place was so incredible that I went a few times while visiting Austin. The guacamole appetizer was phenomenal.  Absolutely fresh avocado and ingredients. I also thought it was a generous portion for the price. The tacos are a little more expensive than your food truck tacos. However   these are larger tacos filled with high quality ingredients. I tried the following tacos  barbacoa  shrimp and carnitas. BARBACOA  Let me repeat barbacoa is an absolute must order. The meat was so juicy and melted in your mouth. I would eat these every day if I could. The side order of refried beans was also yummy. I got a mango drink that was large and just okay. Would probably pass the next time. The only con to this place is that parking stinks and sometimes during peak hours there can be a long wait for your order. While I was there the online order system was down so I couldn t even call ahead and place my order. Nevertheless this is a must stop taco spot for Austin  
Veracruz All Natural,32,I am changing my last review trusting that the fingernail salsa cashier is gone now. May the yum live on.
Veracruz All Natural,33,We live in the neighborhood and love Littlefield.  Unfortunately  the service at Veracruz is a joke    We walked over from our house for lunch and was told by the lady in the window she would not accept a walk up order and could only order online.  What       Took me 15 min to create an online account with them only to have it not work.  Pack up that truck and leave the neighborhood if you can t take an order from a neighbor the old fashion way.
Hecho En Mexico,1,Honestly this is one of my favorite little spots here in Austin  I came across it when I moved across the street and was craving a margarita  and they were there to save me  Main highlights   Service 10 10   The woman  not sure if she s the owner  serving us was amazing. She was basically running the whole restaurant by herself  taking all the tables  making drinks  and still providing incredible service. I am a server in fine dining restaurants downtown and she was better at her job than most of the people there    The food came out quickly and everything was hot  fresh and very delicious   Food  I went for the frozen mango margarita  guacamole  and the chicken enchiladas  YUM  Best frozen mango marg I have ever had it almost tasted like a smoothie  Enchiladas were delicious as well as the sides that it came with. Guacamole could use a little more flavor but it came with yummy homemade chips  I could ve eaten those chips all day   My only wish is that we had more of those incredible chips.   Overall  a casual joint that is nicer than you re average hole in the wall  with a much better quality of food. So excited it s my new neighborhood spot 
Hecho En Mexico,2,We came for dinner and were surprised to see no one dining in  The restaurant owner was super nice and friendly. She seated us and made some great recommendations. We ended up sharing one Queso Flameado w  veggies for appetizer and one flan for dessert. I got the La Margarita salad w  beef for entree  while my partner got the vegetarian enchiladas.   Their queso is the best  amp  most authentic I ve ever had  Super dense and thick  very rich  packed with flavors and vegetables  tomatoes  mushrooms etc   It paired perfectly with either the provided flour tortilla or the complementary chips.  La Margarita salad w  beef - it s called salad  but it was gigantic and loaded with a good variety of very filling ingredients - chorizo  beans  corns  cheese  and rice. Given its portion  I could not believe how cheap it is   9 w o meat . It s a great entree either on its own or with meat added. The dressing was amazing too.   Corn Flan - simply amazing  Perfect level of sweetness and richness. You can taste the corn kernel in the flan - feels holistic.  The restaurant owner told us about the other location of Hecho En Mexico. She said the menus are fairly different for the two locations  because they try their best to accommodate the demographic nearby. I found that very thoughtful.   The restaurant was very clean and well maintained. The interior decor was simple yet modern. I can see it being a great place for both a quick lunch and a relaxing dinner with families and friends.   Would love to check out the other location next time 
Hecho En Mexico,3,Absolutely delicious dinner after a long day. Started off with chips with salsa and guacamole. A must have is the margarita with tajin rim. 10 10 recommend. For the entree  the beef flautas hit the spot  The food had great flavor. The patio was also very lovely. It was quiet so no noise from the highway or street. Lastly  the staff was beyond kind and made sure all needs were met.   If you re in the area of the airport  you must eat here.
Hecho En Mexico,4,We stopped in before a show out of convenience and we weren t disappointed. It was Saturday night around 6 and they weren t busy at all  there was one other family inside. Our server was very polite and answered any questions we had about the menu. He also let us know what specials he had that were not on the menu so that was nice. Speaking of the menu  it s kind of all over the place in my opinion. They advertise as a Mexican restaurant but they have  options that are more on the Italian side. We had two specialty margaritas and they were better than most  they came in regular water glasses though. We got the shrimp ceviche starter which was really good but I thought the shrimp pieces were a bit too big for ceviche. We shared the chicken quesadilla and it was so yummy  It came with an order of refried beans and rice. They do have a small space for outdoor seating which looked nice. If you re ever around the area and want some good Mexican food  I would suggest this spot. I would say look at the menu first  it s not like a normal Jalisco that most of us are probably used to.
Hecho En Mexico,5,Disgrace of a restaurant  15 for a tiny quesadilla   14 for a tiny serving of ceviche food is mediocre at best not worth the prices they charge. Never again
Hecho En Mexico,6,Stopped here as they have an outside patio which is dog friendly and we were craving mexican food.  The service was prompt  the food was good  and the space was great.  The Sopa Azteca had great flavor and the mole poblano sauce was great.
Hecho En Mexico,7,Love this place strongly recommend the cafe de holla. Chilaquiles were crunchy and great flavor. New to the area and I m so happy I took the decision to stop by this place for breakfast.
Hecho En Mexico,8,This location is nothing like the original on William Cannon. I was really excited to take my family here and it was quite the disappointment. It was a Saturday night and completely empty. The original location has a beautiful menu and great ambience with live music some nights. This location seemed like a pop-up restaurant with QR codes for menus. The food was good but overpriced. Nothing stood out to be amazing. The waitress was sweet but very forgetful. If you re looking for authentic Mexican on the east side there s better options.
Hecho En Mexico,9,I am a huge fan of this restaurant  The service has been outstanding both times I ve visited and they have a lot of parking right in front of the restaurant. I ordered the Flautas Mayas and they were good  The flautas mayas were not what I expected though  I expected more traditional Mexican flautas and these tasted a bit more like enchiladas to me.  I ve also had the chilaquiles for breakfast which were also good.
Hecho En Mexico,10,Dined in with my family. First time here. The server and bartender were so friendly and attentive   suggested a delicious salsa   with ghost pepper in it   which i highly suggest   And the soup of the day was delicious as well   Made conversation with us. And the drinks were delicious   Best micheladas we ever had btw and strawberry margaritas were just right    Thank you so much for the experience   worth the money in our opinion.
Hecho En Mexico,11,The food here was amazing. I had their Huevos Revueltos  Noe Tacos and  Hugo taco. The flavor was amazing and I would definitely come here again. My only complaint would be the beans. Great service too
Hecho En Mexico,12,The service was good  and they have a banger hot sauce  but the salsa was just really weird. It was too sweet  almost like a jelly or syrup.
Hecho En Mexico,13,Food is great  they don t just have tres leches cake but a cuatro leches cake also  I liked the mini tacos the most  I substituted pork for beef fajita.
Hecho En Mexico,14,Been coming to Hecho for a few months now and always feel like I m eating with my own family. The staff is great  the food is great as well  and i can t resist the frozen margaritas.  My typical order   Frozen Margarita Dipping Queso Fish tacos Flan
Hecho En Mexico,15,THIS IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD    STAY AWAY    Idk what you wanna call it. Probably the worst  mexican food  I ve ever had. I usually never write reviews but I felt the need to let people know to not come here  i don t even know how they re still in business. Me and my family came in for a quick lunch before a concert and this was the closest Mexican restaurant we could find. The chips are bland with no salt at all  the salsa is NOT salsa  it taste like ketchup. The fajita  had the consistency of a rubber tire and rice and beans tasted like it came out of a can. Please save your money and time.
Hecho En Mexico,16,My coworkers and I checked out this place today since it s close to work. First  the chips were stale and had no salt and the salsa was bland. We all ordered the lunch special which came with the soup of the day  an entree and a dessert. The soup alone took ten minutes to come out  then our meals came out except for two meals. The two meals that took the longest were cheese enchiladas and tacos  even though one of my coworkers got all three meat enchiladas and those somehow came out faster. I got the cauliflower and it had absolutely no flavor. It was season-less cauliflower deep fried in a season-less batter with a tiny drizzle of sauce. I had to order extra sauce to dip it in just to get through it. The rice and beans also had no flavor and required salt. I tried my friend s chicken quesadilla  and again  NO FLAVOR. It tasted like boiled chicken and salt-less cheese in a soggy tortilla. I m absolutely convinced they keep no seasoning in their kitchen and I actually thought for a second I may have covid because I could barely taste the food. The service was ridiculously slow even though we were one of three tables sat. We ended up having to ask for our dessert to go and the waitress scoffed because the rose mousse may  melt  but what choice did we have   It had already been an hour and a half....needless to say  the mousse didn t melt  but it and the  quatro  leches cake were both disgusting. The cake was DRY and tough. Idk how you make a tres leches cake dry  let alone a quatro one.  Needless to say we will NEVER be back and I implore anyone with taste buds to stay away.
Hecho En Mexico,17,As a lunch spot  this place consistently delivers. I typically get the shrimp tacos on blue corn tortillas.  So should you.
Hecho En Mexico,18,Some of the most authentic Mexican Food I have tasted. Known for their Moles  Try all three. Service with a smile and above and beyond. Take the trip and support local   family owned business  
Hecho En Mexico,19,Pretty good food. The complimentary chips and salsa was a great addition to the very quick and kind service. Vegan enchiladas could have been better with vegan cheese.
Hecho En Mexico,20,Amazing hidden gem. This place needs more traffic. Get the enchiladas  Service is amazing. Margaritas are great too 
Hecho En Mexico,21,Service was not good. Food was mediocre. We had to flag down the server to even get us more water. Never checked on us after our food arrived and didn t get the things we needed or our order correct.
Hecho En Mexico,22,I couldn t be more pleased with the best interior Mexican food south of the river. The staff and owners are great. It s obvious they care.  If you re ever on the West side  I recommend you take part in their Tequila paired dinner the last Wednesday of each month. A four course dinner starting at 7pm. Each entree will be paired with a matching Tequila cocktail.  Looking forward to celebrating 5 5 cinco de maya with HeM.
Hecho En Mexico,23,Great food  Fantastic food  Bad service. We waited for quite a while as the waitress casually chatted with the patrons. I get it. But jeez.
Hecho En Mexico,24,This place is fantastic for actual Mexican food  not tex-mex. Had the ceviche which was perfect. Their Carne pibil  or cochinitia pibil  is one of the best I ve had. And also amazing mexican martinis.  We had phenomenal service  in such a relaxing environment. Highly  highly recommend 
Hecho En Mexico,25,Great food.  Don t pay attention to bad reviews.  I had soup  ceviche and fajitas.  Soup and ceviche were great.  Fajitas were good nothing out of ordinary.  Great tortillas.  Forgot good cold beer and drinks.
Hecho En Mexico,26,I wanted to try a new place  pick here close to my hotel. Got there  no customer  seems newly opened    . Honestly disappointed  two fish tacos and side of guacamole  charge  6.50   offered blue tortilla shell instead of regular one  without telling me that was additional charge... ended up  22 plus  2 for tips.  Over priced and food was ok. If I am not on the business trip and too exhausted to find better option  I won t come back here... gave three starts  since they used salmon for their fish.
Hecho En Mexico,27,This is our go to and favorite Mexican restaurant. We love the authentic flavors and fresh ingredients that they use.  All dishes we ve tried so far are really good  from the enchiladas to their dinner plates. My favorite is Carne Pibil. So soft and juicy roasted pork with a delicious marinate flavor. Staff is super friendly and the location is just great for us living in South Austin. We always forget to take pictures but will do for sure next time 
Hecho En Mexico,28,I have been here a handful of times so far and it is very good flavors of more traditional Mexican flair.  The chips and salsa are usually pretty good and it is a great thing  because you had better plan on being there a long time.  The service is super  super slow.  Like an hour   for lunch for three folks.  The restaurant is not very big and it never seems to be overly busy  it just seems to take forever to get food.    I must admit the last time we went  one of my coworkers  after waiting a long time for his food ended up finding a huge hair right in the middle of it.  He was hesitant to have them remake it because it had taken so long.  He just changed it to tacos so we could try and get out of there.  It took another 20 minutes to get the tacos and when we checked out  the waitress made sure we knew that they didn t double charge us... Not that they comped us  just that they didn t double charge us.  Very disappointed.
Hecho En Mexico,29,The best Mexican food I ve ever had - and I ve had a lot.  Love the salmon tacos.  Can t wait to eat there again.
Hecho En Mexico,30,The service was great and our waitress was very nice..but we were the only people in there  the enchiladas were really plain and it was just kinda meh.
Hecho En Mexico,31,Awesome food  Not typical boring Tex-mex  but food with actual soul. That s hard to come by around here unless you re grabbing some quick  2 tacos from a truck. If you want real quality Mexican cuisine  this is the place.
Hecho En Mexico,32,Mexican food heaven  Authentic and exquisite Mexican food  Excellent service and rare Mexican recipes. We had the mole and the Chile en bogada  and they were just exquisite. Please support them.
Hecho En Mexico,33,Ordered from DoorDash and the items on the menu looked amazing  Ordered the beef tacos  steak nachos  and shrimp ceviche. Food was very bland... it looked great but man  the flavors  for the tacos and nachos  were very bland. What a bummer. Ceviche was ok  but much more bitter than what I have had many times in the past. Also pickled carrots  cauliflower  and peppers were included with the meals which did not match the cuisine and left me scratching my head.
Hecho En Mexico,34,The service was great and the margaritas were good  but the food was only okay. I ordered the chicken nachos  and there was not really any substantive chicken in the nachos. I felt like I just had chips when I had the course. There was no real flavor to the dish either.  I don t think nachos are an extremely complicated dish  so I am a little harsher on this rating than I usually am. I have heard a lot of good things about this restaurant though  so I would like to try again in the future.
Hecho En Mexico,35,This place is cute and a hidden gem  I feel in love with the interior  mostly the open concept. The service was amazing  drinks were on point but the al pastor tacos were blended. The prices across the board are very reasonable.   The meat was over cooked in it s own oil - seems as if it was reheated. The tortillas were very hard but since the meat was extremely greasy  it sorta helped. I am open to trying another dish but not very pleased with their tacos.   The server did suggest a spicy salsa  it was good but very acidic. It was missing flavor. The margarita was the best thing I ordered.   Over all  good drinks  this helps for retention of customers  but the mexican food is missing flavor across the board.
Hecho En Mexico,36,This place is wonderful. Unexpected live music  the most genuine  friendly staff who are accommodating and informative - wonderful drinks  generous portions with wonderful taste. Don t have Grand Marnier  That s ok- we will let you taste this beautiful replacement that is better.    Believe the house recommendation - mole  soups  drinks - unbelievable how helpful   Come in  sit down  visit with your friends and enjoy this place.
Hecho En Mexico,37,Bauhant  brandy and orange peel liquor  should be added to the creamy house margarita  The amazing service and fantastic appetizers are great for happy hour  but the quality and live in the food will keep you enticed for more...so much more   The mole sauce sampler is the best of a sesame  creamy  white   and habanero sauce  Start with the guacamole and blue corn tortillas  queso flamiado  choriza and veggies  and ceviche  Drinks- house frozen margarita with a shot of Bauchant  cognac with orange peel liquor  Your entree should be pork shank with mole poblano rice and beans. I am so full that I can not breathe 
Hecho En Mexico,38,We travel from Houston and make sure every time we are in Austin  we stop by. This place is truly a hidden gem. Everything from a 2 dollar taco to a full plate is amazing. We can t wait to come back.
Hecho En Mexico,39,We first went to a Tequila dinner and that was so much fun we loved the food and drinks at the other location on William Canon then found out they had just opened a new location.  We go here about once a week after work.  The spicy salmon and shrimp diabla are both great dishes.  Another favorite are the salmon tacos  the mole trio and there is a spicy soup to die for.
Hecho En Mexico,40,Got delivery from GrubHub  chicken enchiladas. The flavor was fine  the black beans were very salty. The rice was a little crunchy but it has been that way several times so maybe it s intentional. 1 star review because although I didn t notice anything undercooked  I got terrible food poisoning. I know it was this food because my husband and I almost never order the same dish  but this time we did and we are both very ill  throwing up all night  etc . I liked the south location ok and have ordered here twice because it is close to me  but it s definitely not worth the risk of getting sick.
Hecho En Mexico,41,I was super excited to try this place because I had heard good things about it from friends. The interior is super cute and modern and I love the skull artwork inside. Came during lunch so I ordered the lunch special. All lunch specials are  14 and include an entree  soup of the day and dessert. I ordered the tacos al pastor - pork and pineapple tacos  poblano potato soup and rose petal mousse. Unfortunately I was highly disappointed with my dish. It was wayyyy too salty and just not anything amazing. My group was pretty disappointed  as well. My favorite thing was my soup  delish   And the great service from our server. Unfortunately  I don t think I ll be returning.

Hecho En Mexico,43,Wow... this place really missed the ball here  Great location with all of the new homebuilts all dying for a local place to go  btw this is my 2nd visit... I tried to give it another chance  Unfortunately I can t see anyone calling this place a good local place    First  the chips and salsa could not have been worse.  The Salsa tastes like a spicier version of ketchup and the chips were not any better.    Second  we sat at the bar and it was extremely uncomfortable.   The bar is WAY to high for the bar stools.  Either get taller bar stools or drop the bar.  The current condition is completely unacceptable.  The ambiance outside of this is not any better.    There definitely was zero thought process into the design.    The food  outside of these complaints  was decent.  Not great ....but I would probably make a trip back if not for the ladder issues  it being less than a mile from my house and all .  The service was decent but I kind of believe that it was decent  because there were only 10 of us in the restaurant.    I think the owner should spend a little time here and ask the locals for suggestions  This could be a great neighborhood restaurant based on the location but with the set up the way it is... no way  I ll make the drive downtown before I come back here 
Hecho En Mexico,44,Great chips and salsa. Super smooth vibe. Joyful live music. What s not to like   The food didn t blow me away but I still enjoyed my dining experience with my husband because of the energetic ambiance.  I ordered the chicken chipotle enchiladas with refried beans. The beans were so good -- I wish I would ve ordered double beans to replace the rice. The creamy chipotle sauce was also great and I enjoyed the cheese inside of the enchiladas. However  the chicken inside was dry.   I was a bit upset my enchiladas didn t come with fresh pico de gallo or some shredded lettuce. I had maybe 3 teeny tiny chunks of tomato and cilantro on top of my enchiladas    My husband ordered the beef quesadillas and loved the beef  but didn t feel the tortillas were authentic. He also wished there had been more pico de gallo on his plate -- the quesadillas came with a mound of sour cream and a little spoonful of pico de gallo  if that. When you re eating such rich and cheesy Mexican food  the bright acidity of pico de gallo is essential to round out the flavors of the meal.   Cool place  but I don t think my husband and I would be dying to return if we were in the hood.
Hecho En Mexico,45,Highly unimpressed with the food at hecho en Mexico. The food here lacked spice of any form it came off as  New Mexican  food  not the advertised traditional. They charged a 80c fee for me using a debit card   The management was rude when we ordered the morning margarita advertised on the menu until 2pm on Sundays  amp  tried to charge  7 for a margarita we did not order. Overall this place was not worth the time or the money spent here  you won t be missing anything. It s always a bad sign when a place does not provide chips  amp  salsa  amp  charges extra for subbing to CORN TORTILLAS. Who puts al pastor tacos of flour  Worse enough they don t even make their Flour tortillas. Furthermore  our server was very nice  and offered good service.
Hecho En Mexico,46,Great addition to the neighborhood  We went on a Saturday night around 9 and were seated immediately. The chips left something to be desired  which is why I knocked a star off. The chips and salsa experience are the first impression- don t want to ruin it  The enchiladas  however  were amazing. I ordered the Banderas with pork  which is their Mexican flag inspired dish with red and Verde sauce  with sour cream. It was bursting with pork and the charro brands and rice were spot on. My husband got the Chipotle cream enchiladas  which were heavier on the sauce than I prefer  but at least it was tasty and you can scrape some sauce off.  I definitely want to go back for happy hour 
Hecho En Mexico,47,Sat at the bar  which is oddly about 12 inches taller than normal. I felt like a little kid barely able to reach my drink. Ordered a margarita. A guy who appeared to be training our server asked if she knew how to make it  she said yes and he disappeared. She used the wrong end of the jigger  giving us essentially a triple sec margarita with a quarter ounce of tequila. We drank it anyway. Another table ordered a strawberry margarita  which wasn t made with strawberry puree. It was made with a strawberry syrup like you would pour on a snow cone. Watermelon was the same.  Ordered the flameado. It was awesome. Blue corn tortillas reminded me of Mexico. The complimentary chips  store bought  and salsa were ok. Would ve been way better with a good tortilla chip. If you aren t going to make your own  HEB makes really good tortilla chips. These tasted like Tostitos or something.  I got a relleno with pork  almonds  raisins. It was ok. Nothing great. Bf ordered shrimp tacos. I think the shrimp was ground or minced and mixed with a creamy sauce. It had the texture of a tuna fish sandwich. It was so gross. We assumed the shrimp would be whole or whole-ish. But it was a pasty pile of pink glopped into a  store bought  flour tortilla. Our server took it away for us and offered something else. He got the cheese enchiladas with Verde sauce and loved them.    Trainer guy comes back out to help her make drinks for another table. He continuously had his hands in his longish hair. Running his fingers all through his hair and then traying up plates. Our server was very nice.   Based on the reviews  we were so excited to eat here. None of the food  that I saw  looked like any of the pictures on their website. I looked at their William cannon location s pictures and the food looked lovely. Ours looked sad. Might come back for the flameado  but I will watch how my margarita is made.
Hecho En Mexico,48,The food is good. Some dishes are GREAT. Once my husband and I found our favorites here  we found ourselves craving this place. Our favorites are the Caldo soup and cheese enchiladas w  chipotle sauce. We recommend dining in because the quality is not as good when taken to go. The reason for a low rating is the costumer service has never been impressive.
Hecho En Mexico,49,I ordered the 3 mole enchiladas online and picked them up to-go. The staff were friendly. Staff were wearing masks. Diners inside were seated far apart. There were no people congregating in close proximity waiting for to go orders. I appreciate the COVID precautions taken.   Enchiladas were muy bueno  I ordered online via Postmates. There wasn t an option to tip at checkout  and I didn t have cash on me to tip  unfortunately. That s my only disappointment. I plan on ordering to-go again soon  and next time I will try the rellenos  for sure- Next time I will call in my order and pay upon arrival so I can tip 
Hecho En Mexico,50,This place has brought some much needed charm and cheap margaritas to the east Riverside area  Understand that this is a sweet hole in the wall spot on Montopolis.  They re still figuring things out but the warm welcome and clear effort on the part of this small business is worth the 5 stars. Any negative reviews here are people that seem to want to bring people down instead of build them up.   We ordered the pork wrapped in banana leaves and the shrimp salad. We didn t order anything with mole but really wanted to try it so they brought us a sampler of all three. They were AMAZING  I don t even like mole that much but man were they crazy delicious.   They treat you so well here. I was unsure on which soup to order and they brought me a sampler of both soups. Who does that   Incredible service.  Please respect the kindness here and don t stop by if you re gonna be an asshole. This place will always treat you right.
Hecho En Mexico,51,This place was fantastic. Authentic Mexican food from different parts of Mexico  Yes please  I m a fan of the enchiladas banderas. My friend loved the chili relleno and it was great  We also tried the mole enchiladas the week prior. Not my cup of tea but still good. The drinks have a nice kick  Ceviche was yummy. I don t care much for the salsa and chips but everything else is a win for me. Biggest win  Location. Finally a nice little place not too far from home to enjoy a nice meal and cocktail. My best friend and I went twice in one week and we will be going back 
Hecho En Mexico,52,Don t waste your time or money.   I went to go eat here for the first time yesterday. I felt very encouraged by the high ratings and was excited for their large drink menu.   I will NEVER go back.  The salsa tasted like ketchup. Nasty.  The nachos were microwaved  amp  bland. The guacamole add-on barely covered any of nachos yet was  9.00s.   The WORST part about this place is the pink chicken inside the enchiladas has me PUKING since around midnight last night. It s 7 10 in the morning  amp  now I have to miss work.   All this shit because I decided to try this crappy restaurant. Fix your damn food rather than hyper stare at me while I eat it please.
Hecho En Mexico,53,It was okay  definitely not the best though. I loved the inside and decor. It s a tiny restaurant. Right off the bat  the server got us our drinks. I had a strawberry margarita and my husband had a Tito s soda. Both were delicious. I had the pastor tacos and he had chicken fajitas. The food took quite some time to get out  we were also the only people there . The food was okay. Service was okay. Wasn t too special and not sure if I ll come back.
Hecho En Mexico,54,The problem here  is that the prices don t reflect the quality and taste of the food.   Also  the portions were a lot smaller than expected    - The guacamole  like a small ice cream scoop. - Burrito was smaller than a Chipotle burrito  but tasted as bland.  - Salsa was not spicy  but tasted alright.   I say again. Food is NOT bad  but for the prices  I expected better.
Hecho En Mexico,55,Hecho en Mexico  get your sh.. together  I love the decor  the concept  and the idea of the menu  but the quality is so inconsistent  I ordered a to go dish with rice and beans. I was given the wrong kind of beans -no big deal  but they were extremely salty  and the rice was extremely bland. I ve had this experience before with other menu items  either too salty  too much of one spice  not enough of another  or altogether a different item than what the dish should be. If there was consistency and quality in flavors  I would be there all the time  but I ve been let down one too many times. It s a shame because I really like the idea of it. The one saving grace is their delicious moles.
Hecho En Mexico,56,At the recommendation of a friend  I went here.  It s not too far from the airport and they have an awesome happy hour - really great price on margaritas and chips  amp  salsa.  Chips are homemade.  Meals are wonderful and they have some great dishes.  Definitely will come to this establishment again 
Hecho En Mexico,57,Being from El Paso where there s REAL Mexican food  this place is shit. Will not get food from here again. Definitely prefer TexMex over this wannabe  mexican  food. Not to mention  the rice was completely undercooked. Would give zero stars  but apparently one star is required to rate. Please change the name of your restaurant to something that does not translate to  Made in Mexico  as to not be misleading to those who don t know or have not experienced real Mexican food.
Hecho En Mexico,58,This is my first time here and let me say..... Steak fajitas are bomb as hell     I asked the very nice server for some spicer salsa and let me tell you they delivered. We got a very good size portion on the fajitas as well as rice beans and pico on the side. Very clean inside as well. Customer service was on point. My family and I will definitely be back again to try new stuff.
Hecho En Mexico,59,The restaurant has a nice clean setting.  The server I had was great and went over the menu and gave recommendations for each group of items.  I had the Fluatas Maya  one chicken and one shrimp  and they were fantastic   A great recommendation for anyone 
Hecho En Mexico,60,This restaurant has the best drinks. The Rey Noe Martini is absolutely delicious. The appetizers are great as well. We had the Taquitos al Pastor  the guacamole and the beef fajitas. Everything was great  Will definitely come back 
Hecho En Mexico,61,I love Hecho  The staff are friendly and the drinks are delicious. The entrees are yummy.
Hecho En Mexico,62,The three plate enchiladas fantastic. Not a fan of the rice love the black beans.   Dessert I had was the rose petal mousse and the mole ice cream.
Hecho En Mexico,63,Great new place in an area that has few sit down eateries   Strong drinks  good service  good food.  Queso flameado was yummy.  Ditto to nachos and chicken enchiladas.
Hecho En Mexico,64,Still great  still consistently tasty  and still as close as it gets to the food in Mexico.  Especially the migas.  I love the service too.
Hecho En Mexico,65,I really  really wanted to like this place. Came in on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only table. The server was super nice and attentive  but the food was so bad. I don t even know how to describe my dish. I ordered the shrimp taco plate and it was absolutely inedible. The shrimp were swimming in mayonnaise and chipotle. Swimming. The menu said it came with a sauce  but I thought it would be more like a light drizzle. Not a total deal breaker yet  but I took a bite and the shrimp tasted SO fishy. Almost unrecognizable as shrimp. It tasted old and foul. Even the rice and beans were bad. Bland  maybe store-bought  Hard to say. I took one bite of the taco and then left to get a proper lunch. My friend s food was bad too and tasted like vinegar. So disappointed.
Hecho En Mexico,66,Everything I ve ever had here has been amazing. You have to try the mole sampler. The best Mole I ve ever had. Great selection of tequilas and margaritas as well.
Hecho En Mexico,67,Stopped in on a Saturday for a late afternoon nibble. Was pleasantly surprised to see a Happy Hour menu that was offered 7 days a week.  We ordered margaritas  on the rocks   beef fajita quesadillas  reg.  13  and ceviche  reg.  11 .  The margarita tasted a tad too sweet for our liking but definitely drinkable. The quesadillas were tasty  but the serving size was quite small. And the ceviche was just so-so.  The HH special was 1 2 off these apps - but based on our experience  neither of these appetizers was worth their full menu price. The one major suggestion we would make to the restaurant is to get some blinds  shades  tinted window film etc. for the southwest-facing windows. That afternoon sun -- wow oh wow  It s brutal around 4pm. I can imagine in the summer months those rays heat that restaurant up quickly   If you go in around Happy Hour  3-7p I think  on a sunny day  save your eyeballs and sit at the bar or the tables closest to the door.
Hecho En Mexico,68,This was a recommendation by the hotel. The service was great and the food was very good  not to mention the presentation.  If I lived in the area I would definitely come back.
Hecho En Mexico,69,I came here cause of the location and from the good reviews.   Avion Margarita was really good    The disappointing part was the food. I ordered the pork fajitas which were topped with what was probably the salsa that comes with the chips  a side of hard rice  beans and toppings.   Also  they brought me blue corn tortillas that were obviously microwaved. Not a good choice for an Authentic Mexican restaurant. The Tres Leches cake was also chewy and actually seemed kinda old.   For  60 before tip....not worth coming back to eat. Maybe for a quick drink.
Hecho En Mexico,70,This place is great  It s new  cute  and clean with nice touches to make it feel fancy. The happy hour is great and wait staff is awesome. Everything we ve eaten and all the drinks we ve had have been great. We will definitely be back 
Hecho En Mexico,71,Could I give this place no stars   They were not busy at all and could not get waited on. The staff is horrible. We had to get up and leave because we couldn t even get water.
Hecho En Mexico,72,The drinks are on point.  Get the house frozen half salt.   The food was delicious and the service was friendly and fast.   Nice to have a new neighborhood spot.  I ll be back for margs real soon
Hecho En Mexico,73,My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner here. We split the mole chicken  and it was so delicious. The house margaritas were really good for the price  please note that I live somewhere that would charge  3- 4 more for a similar margarita and have a much cheaper version for  6 .  However  our favorite was the ice cream with mole sauce. Mole is something my husband has tried so hard to explain to me over the years  and he wanted to find some great options while we visited Austin. He was happy with this recommendation  but mostly  thought the dessert was one of the best he has ever had.  The salsa needs a little work.
Hecho En Mexico,74,Great Mexican food  especially the mole. Friendly service  and good options for tequila and mezcal. The complimentary chips and salsa are a big plus and not often found in Austin. Would highly recommend this place to folks looking for good Mexican in the east Austin area.
Hecho En Mexico,75,Microwaved old food. They couldn t even use a microwave right either. Canned jalape os and store bought salsa. I m irritated that I didn t cook instead. If you enjoy being sick after you eat  this place is for you  I ll never return.
Hecho En Mexico,76,DELICIOUS    Very authentic Mexican dishes with such delicious flavors. We were a bigger party so we ordered several dishes to try a variety. Not one disappointed. The mole  frijoles charros  chile en nogada  carne pibil  sops Azteca  the list goes on were so tasty. Everything was on point. And there blue corn tortillas were just as authentic. Mario was great at explaining their dishes and style. Definitely recommend 
Hecho En Mexico,77,This is my new  favorite Mexican place in Austin. The food is excellent  the staff are friendly and helpful  it s surprisingly cheap for the quality of the meals  and the restaurant is new and well maintained. Great lunch spot.
Hecho En Mexico,78,Service was prompt and friendly. The food was not up to par for me. Lacking in flavor.
Hecho En Mexico,79,Excellent food     BUT DON T GO WITH A GROUP. Our server was so bad it was actually comical. He kept using the excuse    we were so many people  that we started counting how many times he used it  And what a shame since we all represented a total of 10 different hotels in the area. But having said that  I can t discount the excellent caliber of food. I personally had the cochinita pibil  shredded pork in a banana leaf . O. M. G. It was fabulous  There were several dishes at our table and each one was fantastic. There was finally another waiter that came to help and he was very good. I will definitely return but not with a group. I m hoping that will get better...
Hecho En Mexico,80,Great service and amazing food  Our group was 22 people and they were able to accommodate us quickly. A special thank you to Daniel and his crew for the wonderful service an amazing evening 
Hecho En Mexico,81,This place is a hidden gem  Food was delicious  margaritas were awesome   amp  great happy hour  We re definitely coming back for breakfast  amp  brunch.
Hecho En Mexico,82,I was really hungry around 8pm so I yelped to find a restaurant near me. Looking at the photos on the reviews sold me. I went in and surprised it was a new tiny restaurant. Being Hispanic myself I didn t see much of a variety of Mexican food. Waitress didn t understand what I was ordering from the menu even though I read and spoke it as it said. When my order came in I saw nothing truly authentic. Beans looked and tasted like canned beans. Tortillas didn t taste freshly made more like store bought. Salsa tasted super bland. I give it three stars for fast and friendly service.
Hecho En Mexico,83,Underwhelming. A bit pricey and smaller portions. I was cautioned about my plate being hot and the mole sauce was luke warm. The service was excellent and the dish had a nice presentation. I would have hoped that the serving size and food temperature would have matched the price.
Hecho En Mexico,84,This place is wonderful  The food is unique and delicious. I love Tex-Mex   but this isn t Tex-Mex and Austin has plenty of those anyway. This place offers a rare window into the wide variety of Mexican cuisine. The flavors are complex and interesting. We had Ceviche  Flautas  and Mole Blanco with shrimp. They were all fantastic. The salsa is smokey and flavorful and if you ask  they ll give also give you their secret salsa  but be careful  The prices were reasonable and the portion size appropriate. The service was excellent too. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Austin.
Hecho En Mexico,85,The restaurant team is friendly  kind  and positive thinking. The food is delicious with spices and actual tastes that are familiar and like family cooking. Thank you for joining our neighborhoods.
Hecho En Mexico,86,Good little neighborhood spot to grab a drink. Prices are higher than normal Mexican restaurants in the area though. But best advice I can give this place  if it has any chance of surviving.. GET NEW HOUSE SALSA    Like seriously WTH  ..I don t think I ve ever had bad house salsa in my life. But theirs is BAD BAD. It doesn t even taste like salsa  it tastes like tomato sauce. Who decided on this   WHO   They should be fired immediately. Other than the salsa  the rest of their food is great and the portions are large. Service can be kinda slow and spotty  but they re new and Austin isn t known for great service esp in this economy  with the unemployment rate being so low  it s REALLY hard right now to find good help .
Hecho En Mexico,87,Hecho is my favorite place to get Mexican food in Austin  We usually go to the location on William Cannon but recently found out about this location on the east side that s closer to us so obviously we wanted to check it out. The frozen margaritas are amazing and cheap  especially if you go during happy hour. We always order the queso and fajitas and love them. Pro tip  ask for the spicy salsa  So incredibly good 
Hecho En Mexico,88,Love that this is in our neighborhood. It s a quiet intimate atmosphere with great costumer service. I recommend the rancheros chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend loved the chicken Chile rellenos. If you want more spicy salsa just ask  they have some already made in the back for those who love spicy like us.
Hecho En Mexico,89,Love his place for its food  ambiance and people. Everytime I come to this restaurant I am greeted with enthusiasm and the host and servers always give good recommendations. Being from Mexico myself  I can say this is one of the most genuine Mexican restaurants in Austin  combining authenticity with superb service. It s truly a gem 
Hecho En Mexico,90,I live right down the street from Hecho en Mexico and it is one of my favorites  I m not a huge fan of their chips and salsa  but I have been very pleased with everything else I have had.  Their food and drinks are great and their happy hour is an awesome deal. Try the Taquitos al Pastor and the martini 
Hecho En Mexico,91,This place is my new go to. The salsa was the best I ve ever had  the Mezcal selection was impressive  and we even had an amazing musician playing. I don t rate many places  but def wanted to give props where it was due 
Hecho En Mexico,92,I really hate to say this  but after having tried the south location a few years ago I was pretty excited to see this open up right here on the east side. But I have to say it was one of the most disappointing food experiences I ve had in some time. There wasn t really anything that was good  I was pretty shocked at how flavorless and bland everything was. Even the salsa and tortilla chips needed salt. We ordered the cauliflower appetizer which was most definitely not  9 worthy. The burrito was odd flavors and ingredients. I had the poblano relleno which wasn t even warm  the rice wasn t cooked all the way and had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever. The beans tasted like canned refried beans.  I rarely post comments and I hate to be that person who had a bad experience but I have to say this was over the top unpleasant. Especially since it cost almost  50 for this food that was not even close to being good. Maybe they re still refining and making things work but I won t go back anytime soon
Hecho En Mexico,93,This review is only for the Montopolis location.  Based on the other reviews plus our experience here  I would say this place can be characterized as generally inconsistent at best  and much too expensive for the food quality  particularly for this neighborhood.  We arrived on a Friday evening about 6 pm and there was one car in the parking lot.  Not a good sign  but we didn t want to look for another place to eat  so we went for it.  The restaurant is located in a small new building across the street from a condo unit that is still under construction  we were expecting old-Montopolis Oltorf sketchy area .  It s a small restaurant  maybe 12 - 15 tables plus about 6 bar stools.  There is not really any decor to speak of  it is pretty spare.  We sat at the bar  and as another reviewer noted  the bar is strangely high.  We got friendly  attentive service from the bartender.  I had a frozen margarita with a floater of some kind of liqueur  they didn t have Grand Marnier   and it was really good  but it ended up costing  20   12 drink plus  8 floater.  Pretty expensive.  The chips are awful  dry and tasteless  very obviously not fresh.  The salsa is awful  just pureed chile sauce without anything else  no onion  garlic  etc.  I ordered the combo enchilada plate with 3 types of mole enchiladas plus black beans and rice.  I appreciate the fact that making most moles from scratch is a time-consuming task  but  18 for 3 enchiladas is pretty steep.  That said  each mole sauce and its enchilada filling was paired well and really delicious.  They made  a yellow mole sauce with chile gueros   which I had never heard of  and it was great on the shrimp-filled enchilada.  Black beans and accompanying rice were alright  but nothing special.  The main issue was that the plate of food arrived lukewarm  not piping hot  and I was only steps from the kitchen.  A couple of strange things that indicate a lack of professional management  the door to the kitchen opens into the door of a cooler that is right inside the kitchen  which poses a logistical problem for everyone entering the kitchen  watching the plate and tray juggling was entertaining   the young daughter of an employee was allowed to lay play on sleep on the bench behind a table  the  manager  sat at a table looking at her laptop and did not make a move to help or supervise at any point during our visit.  This place may make it in the long run  once the new condo unit is finished and more upscale consumers gentrify the area  but it is much too expensive for the current neighborhood and it s just not that good.  Whomever is running the William Cannon location of this restaurant  which gets much better reviews  needs to spend some serious time here and straighten things out.  Their mole sauces make me hope they can get it together.
Love C Spot,1,   Love C Spot has moved to 2100 E Cesar Chavez     STOP READING THIS AND GO NOW   Seriously  go   Went on a Friday night around 7 45  only one other family there. But this must be because of the recent move because they claim to have the best birria in ATX and THEY DELIVERED   Omg I can t stop thinking about it. I didn t answer my phone. I didn t watch TV. I didn t even get a drink. Like seriously  there is nothing more important than eating these birria tacos. I got 3 tacos and 2 flautas for  14  came with consom  AND lots of salsa verde . I loved the crisp on the flautas and the tacos were divine. The consom  and salsa combo sent me to heaven and back. I will definitely be back many many times.   Also  the lovely boy taking orders was so great  Support them  Gorge yourself on birria in all its forms  You MUST try this place.
Love C Spot,2,Dont miss the quality food truck behind the Upscale Market. It is obvious that these folx really care about their customers. The order guy is young  but don t worry  he is a pro and will take care of you  Food comes fast and is top quality.  Birria is top notch and rice is a standout. I bet everything that come out of this truck is just as good because the love factor is there. Dont miss the covered areas on the side and front of market that are available for seating.
Love C Spot,3,Delicious  quick  high quality  so thoughtful. Got a huge order for the whole family- Elotes  High Flyer Fries  C Box  Agua Frescas  Crunchwrap  Flautas  Ground Zero tacos  and more. Everything was amazing  not a thing disappointed. The birria is so tender  the flautas were perfectly crunchy and the quesadillas were packed with flavor and gooey cheese. The High Flyer Fries were a surprise showstopper- amazing meat and pepper goodness  the C sauce has a perfect flavor and spice level. I believe it was the owner who  talked to us about swapping an unavailable chata for agua frescas  she was so nice and made sure we picked the yummiest drinks. The Goddess fresca is refreshing  fruity  flavorful  and fantastic. You can t go wrong here  order what looks good and dig in.
Love C Spot,4,Once again a slammin good visit to Love C Spot...Grandkid in tow we went with the Birria Pizza and Man that thing was huge...packed full of meat  crunchy on the outside...I over indulged as usual with zero leftovers...Along with a great Elote with Hot Cheetos...So Good ...BIG NEWS FOR LOVE C SPOT   ...Indoor dining coming soon...Beat that Texas heat with some Tacos and TV...So excited for them...and US  
Love C Spot,5,The people  the service  and the food are all reasons to eat here. We got the Birria Crunch Wrap   an assortment of chicken and steak tacos that came out swiftly and were oh so flavorful. If you re trying to get your taco fix - C Spot is a must.
Love C Spot,6,Discovered this spot due to a cousin giving a review. Really wish the fajitas were chicken breast instead of thighs. I will say the aqua fresca I had was so good but it wasn t consistent one day I got a chamoy straw the next time I didn t not sure why. Also I ordered the chalupas and specifically requested no onion and cilantro got all the way home and it was packed with both of those things I had to pick it out. I also don t like that you have to pay with venmo cash app there is no protection if something goes wrong with a charge.   I will say I really do see more pros than cons for this place and I am glad I went to try it out. Most of the time I don t enjoy elote in a cup but this has flavor I wish it had less  greasy-ness  but totally get it because I m sure it was in butter.   I will definitely continue to go here.
Love C Spot,7,The food was some of the best we have ever had and the service was even better. Don t let the neighborhood discourage you  The food and service are absolutely worth it  
Love C Spot,8,I ve been on the hunt since I moved to Austin in April last year  and C Spot is by far my favorite Birria in the city. The Birria burrito is a genius creation  fill with Birria meat  rice  beans  cheese  onions and PAPAS  all with a side of consom . Absolutely blissful comfort food. The family who owns it is always so welcoming and you can tell they put a ton of love into their craft. Food always comes out quick and they have a nice inside waiting area. Looking forward to trying everything else on the menu  if I can ever convince myself to skip the burrito.
Love C Spot,9,We had C spot for dinner on Friday and we were SO impressed by how delicious this place is  You can feel the love  and effort they put into into their food in each bite also the portions are very generous.  Their aguas frescas are to die for as well  I tried the Oh My Goddess wich is watermelon and pi a and I highly recommend it. Bravo and Thank You 
Love C Spot,10,My first visit. This place is insanely delicious    I have never eaten tacos  like this. The consomm   which is served with all their plates  is outstanding.  Wow
Love C Spot,11,Exactly what I expected couldn t have asked for better service and food First time trying also 
Love C Spot,12,Seen the pictures and just had to try...so looking for it and it s kind of hidden like a gem...so I decided to try the Birria pizza and also the Birria plate and burrito...just like all the pictures and comments it was really good. I give it 5 stars...and will definitely go back to try all the other things on there menu. Hit them up on Facebook C Spot.
Love C Spot,13,Was visiting from Fort Worth and couldn t find a quesabirria taco spot that was open. We stumbled upon C Spot by accident and so glad we did  I believe it s family owned and they were so very welcoming and kind. The food came out quickly and was so hot and fresh. The next time we re in Austin  we ll definitely be coming back  Highly recommend.
Love C Spot,14,Great service  Was a little nervous at first but the food was amazing     We were visiting from DFW and we re struggling to find a birria stop and this place went over our expectations   12 10  can t wait for another trip to Austin because we will be coming back 
Love C Spot,15,This place is soo amazing  There food is always on point  they are super nice and polite and don t even get me started on there drinks  the stuff they have on the menu is something u wouldn t think is on a normal taco truck and there s just so much more to say  
Love C Spot,16,This place is everything you re looking for.  Family owned and that good homemade meal you re looking for.  It just has that special taste to everything that you can t find everywhere.  It s soooo good  I m so grateful for the hot new spot 
Love C Spot,17,This food is so good. I love the environment and cery comfortable and makes me feel like I hanging out with my family . The owners are amazing and they are my age so I can relate with them on a lot of every day life situations. They are a power family and I just love them . I do recommend this spot . Good food great spirits. Cinci and santos.
Love C Spot,18,Its been soooo long since I ve found a great birria spot and this place has not failed me in the slightest  Definitely come with a hungry appetite because you wil leave with a full stomach 
Love C Spot,19,Hands down the best food truck I ve tried since like forever   The customer service is amazing they make you feel like family.
Love C Spot,20,Trying the birria pizza I hear great things   I want to order everything             
Love C Spot,21,This little food trailer has such a huge selection and everything I ve tried is flavorful and mouth watering  I ve come back a few nights in a row good . The cherry on top is their wonderful customer service   
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,1,This guy makes some mean  cheap tacos.  This is the taco trailer you want in your neighborhood.    We had 5 breakfast tacos  think Torchy s size  - 2 potato  egg  amp  cheese  1 egg  amp  cheese  1 machacado con huevo  1 chorizo  egg  amp  cheese -  7.36.  Not sure how  or if  they will stay in business with those prices  but all of these tacos were excellent.  Large  fresh  hot  tasty  and well mixed  finely chopped  scrambled  etc. .  The sauces were good too.  They gave me a basic chunky pico style salsa and then two thin sauces  one of which is thin version of the dona sauce everyone likes at Taco Deli and the other is an orange-ish brown thin sauce that might be a habanero version of the dona sauce  nice and spicy .  My only recommendations to this guy would be to raise his prices  at  2.50 per taco  they d still be a steal  and claim his Yelp page.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,2,Nice little taco truck  2 item tacos are  1.50 and you can add cheese for a quarter  or you can get 3 two-item tacos for  4.   Aside from the standard breakfast taco fare they serve cactus and egg tacos... I ll try that another day.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,3,Was skeptical at first for its location but had to come for the prices. It wasn t a long wait and got the special which was 3 breakfast tacos for  4. I got Migas and huevo  Chriso and huevo  and eggs and bacon. Very hefty portions and it taste really good.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,4,So I hate giving two stars as it seems so low but as the two star label states  I ve experienced better.   When we got there it seemed there was only one guy taking the orders and cooking.  We had a pretty big order for a few of us so I understood the wait.  A second guy did end up popping out from somewhere and helped him finish up.  Just a note  some of the prices of the different menu items have gone up a dollar since the menu pics were posted in the pictures section.  1 4 pollos asados - Chicken wasn t too dry.  Comes with a thigh and wing  rice and beans.  The picture showed charro but I had refried.  The refried beans were still pretty good - nice and creamy.  The rice was a little too fluffy over cooked for my taste.  The chicken was not dry and it also came with a bunch of sliced onions partially cooked with a nice slight crunch to them.  Ground Beef Taco - the meat was a little bit salty on this one.  The one thing I do have to say  and my coworkers that also had it agree .  Probably not a go back to  but bonus for those who do go is that you do get a good portion of food for the cost.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,5,I can t get over how great this place is  Sure  the window isn t open 100  of the time during  open hours   and he doesn t always answer the phone  but  from my perspective  he makes large  PERFECT tacos for  1.50- he is entitled to as many  sick days   or days with his family  friends  doctor s appointments  whatever  as he wants. Thank you  Dos Amigos  for being my absolute favorite place for breakfast 
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,6,This just another unassuming little truck on the corner of 38 1 2 and Guadalupe across from the Jiffy Lube.  I d seen it a few times and since I had put some cash in my pocket during my morning walk  I decided to check it out.  First off. Be prepared to wait.  There appears to be only one cook there and he takes about 2 or 3 orders at a time and prepares them.  With only one person working the window and grill  it makes sense.  There was 3 people there waiting when I arrived and soon after 3 more showed up.  A few stopped and saw the line and moved on.  So if you have time and only a couple of dollars in your pocket  then this is the place for you.  All of the menu is pretty cheap. I don t think I saw a plate beyond  8.  The tacos are all also under  2.  Breakfast tacos are  1.85  but it s only  3.75 if you buy 3    For Austin  that is a steal   They are nice sized and very full.  I had a cactus and egg  chorizo and egg  and bacon and egg.  The cactus and egg was delicious and tangy just the way I am used to.  The chorizo and egg was good  but needed a little salt.  The bacon egg was a let down because it was just scrambled egg with a slice of bacon in it.  It would be so simple for them to just have diced bacon to throw in with the egg.  The lack of bacon grease cooking the egg is the main reason for my disappointment with that one.  The biggest let down though was the flour tortillas.  They are probably good for anyone that grew up eating restaurant style tortillas or pre-made store ones  but for me  they are not authentic.  They felt and tasted premade.  I have come to realize the closest you can find to homemade at almost all the restaurants north of San Antonio are at people s homes.  HEB does a good one that is close enough. In any case  these were not bad  but would turn my review into 5 stars if they had better ones.  Overall  this is a great little truck with some tasty food for cheap.  VERY cheap.  I shall have to try some of their non breakfast tacos next time.  For under  2 each  they are worth a sample whenever I am not in a hurry.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,7,This place has the best authentic tacos in all of Austin. And before anyone gets defensive talking about Torchy s  Taco Deli  and Taco Joint  I m not saying they re bad  rather that they re good for different things. There s a crowd at this truck for a reason. The people who work there are friendly  and despite the crowds  your food comes out fast. I defy you to find better bang for your buck taco-wise. We got 1 crunchy taco  a beef tostada  a steak  4 enchiladas  and 2 servings of rice and beans for  15 even. And they do NOT mess around on the portion sizzles. Plus  everything is so incredibly tasty and obviously home-made that your mouth will thank you.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,8,This place sells some of the best breakfast tacos I ve ever had. The tacos run about  1.50 to  1.75 each and they make them fresh as you order. Don t let the smelly dumpster or limited parking scare you a way because this food truck is a must try if you are off Guadeloupe and 38th  Please note they are not open all day  And breakfast taco are served until they close but the price goes up 
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,9,I had the pastor taco and that was delicious. Like   omg so good.  The meat was very savory.  I also order Mexican style enchiladas but they had my order wrong   i asked for chickens and one cheese.  They gave me potatoes and eggs for all three enchiladas  on top of more potatoes as a side dish.  I wanted beans and rice...
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,10,I ate a lot of things here.  Quesadilla w Steak - great steak  small  taco-sized   affordable   2.25  but needs more than just meat. Onions peppers would be nice  Migas taco - delicious but for the fact that the tortilla strips were not crunchy  that s a deal-breaker  Bacon egg taco - tasty  reasonable portion  and they use a whole strip of bacon instead of that crumble nonsense  Lengua Taco - I d skip this  it s just ok  Barbacoa Taco - delicious  this is one of the best barbacoa tacos I ve had  Overall  the menu can be hit-or-miss. Don t skip on the barbacoa  though. It s reasonably priced since I paid  10.35 for all of the above  after tax. The line moved a little slow given that it was being operated solamente a uno amigo.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,11,Come here for cheap and tasty breakfast tacos  I get the bacon  egg  potato  and cheese taco. Just thinking about it has my mouth salivating. Literally everything about the taco is on point. The bacon strip was so nice and crispy. And the sauce guys. You must slather the green sauce on your tacos. So delicious and spicy  Love it. The fact that this is a 5 minute walk from my sisters apartment makes me love this place even more. I am definitely grabbing these tacos next time I m in Austin. Maybe I ll even try some other items on the menu.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,12,The three times I ve come to this place the mullets who run it have been AWOL.  I arrive during their posted opening hours and there s an  OPEN  sign in the window  which I rap on  but no tamale.  All we have in life is time  and they wasted some of mine.  It doesn t matter if they have the greatest taco on planet earth if it s unavailable.  No good business practices and no consideration for their patrons     No go.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,13,Great authentic street style tacos. I ve been looking for good tripa tacos and they are the winner for me in Austin so far.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,14,Talk about bang for the buck.... The breakfast tacos are huge and the mini-tacos for lunch aren t  mini  at all. Besides that  they re very yummy. Any time someone suggests Dos Amigos  its always yes please  and thank you 
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,15,Great place with great prices on delicious food.  My favorite is the al pastor plate. Prepare to be stuffed with amazing homemade food from a hardworking family.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,16,Delicious     Try the soft steak tacos w cilantro so so good  The chicken enchilada w green sauce is really good too.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,17,Great tasting and authentic food   hefty portions for the price. The pastor is delicious 
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,18,Great hidden gem. With the a number of food trucks and food truck culture in Austin   this one stands out. Delicious breakfast and lunch options . Their green sauce is absolutely delicious. I have tried pretty much everything in the menu and was never disappointed.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,19,Love this place  great tacos and super cheap.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,20,was waiting across the street at the jiffy lube  getting my car inspected. I spotted this uninspired looking food truck. but I m always down for tacos. I ordered two lingua and a tripa. the tacos were generously loaded with tender meat  sprinkled with onion and cilantro. they were so dericious  nomnom .  1.85 apiece. after shoving them in my face  i left satisfied.....only to return to the waiting room at jiffy lube.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,21,Had 2 breakfast tacos here  added cheese to both so total was  3.50  The sauce they came with was delicious but the cheese was American which is just an automatic strike for me... definitely would not have paid extra if I knew that was the junk  they were putting on my tacos.  Service was really quick  I was the only person in line  Guy in the truck was very friendly.  Nice to have a pleasant interaction with someone at 7am after working all night.  Would return again and not add cheese  the tacos themselves tasted pretty decent otherwise.  Without the cheese experience would probably give 5 stars.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,22,Great breakfast tacos. Filled to the brim and delicious. We would have posted a picture but they were piping hot  fresh made so we chowed down. Big plus-I didn t feel like I was being ripped off like I do at all the hipster joints. We got five tacos for only  8.90. Anywhere else in the Guadalupe area 5 tacos would cost around  20. Service was fast and friendly  much better than the places around here that are run by kids who aren t used to working.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,23,This place is really  really  really good.  The food is cheap and portions are large.  I have tried and can strongly recommend the sopes de lingua  anything with barbacoa  any of their tortas  enchiladas verdes  bistec ranchero  bistec ala Mexicana  nachos de pollo  etc...  Actually  I have yet to try anything that I don t really like.  My wife was born and raised in Northern Mexico and she thinks the food is excellent too.  We live nearby so we come here a frequently.  I recommend you try it if you are nearby 
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,24,My husband and I eat here together every Tuesday. We love the breakfast tacos. I m addicted to their yummy cheesiness in the eggs and their green sauce. Delicious 
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,25,yummmm so inexpensive and delish  everything is great  but my fave is a breakfast burrito with eggs  rice  beans  chorizo and avocado.
Dos Amigos Mexican Food,26,We picked up four of the tacos for lunch here  beef tongue  carnitas  avocado  and chorizo. All but the tongue taco was about  1.60 apiece  tongue was  1.85 . Portion size was large and the tacos were pretty good  though the avocado taco was a little lacking in flavor.
Casa Vallarta,1,Cancun plate hit the spot  Fajita taco and a cheese enchilada  comes with rice and beans  The salsa was perfect  not overly spicy
Casa Vallarta,2,Ok is a perfect description for this place.  I came here for lunch on Friday with a friend from the office.  The service is a bit slow for a lunch rush  but they are friendly.  The biggest negative to the experience was the complete lack of heat to anything. Honestly  the chili gravy and the salsa had zero taste due to the extreme lack of heat.  Their biggest advantage is that they are near my office.  If I go back  I ll either go for breakfast tacos or figure out a way to sneak in something spicy to add to the food.
Casa Vallarta,3,Still coming here for their potato chorizo tacos and I ll never stop Only thing is they stop serving breakfast at 11 am so get those orders in early 
Casa Vallarta,4,This place was amazing. We went to three different restaurants looking for carne asada. The customer service here was amazing. The food was better than any place I ve been to recently for authentic Mexican food. This is not  Tex Mex  she knows what she is doing. Best chips and salsa I ve had in Austin. Rosie has the burn your face off green and red but the salsa with chips was the best. Don t forget our neighborhood Austin home-based restaurants.
Casa Vallarta,5,Had high hopes for this place but did not impress. Ordered 4 fajita burritos at  9 each...overpriced and flavorless.  The Chorichicken burrito with melted yellow cheese on top - honestly wasn t bad but  12  - no rice and beans for a side  or they forgot . Won t come back.
Casa Vallarta,6,Very pleased with the visit   Very good food and service. I m usually pretty undeceive when it comes to picking my food on the menu. So it definitely helped that they had an option with a 3 meat variety w  sides  rice and beans. I look forward to coming back  
Casa Vallarta,7,Ordered a veggie burrito to go. specifically asked for a lot of vegetables.  They were listed on the menu.  Got a burrito with just bean and cheese and nothing else for  8.59.  Called up.  Was out on hold for 10 minutes while they did nothing.
Casa Vallarta,8,Yelp gets it right again. Four stars.         Casa Vallarta is a downscale but completely respectable Mexican restaurant.    Good cooking and good value for the dollar.  I had the pollo guisada gordita.  Most gordita places give you a small amount of filling and a large amount of gordita. This makes sense if the prime attraction of the sandwich is the taste of your toasty gordita.  Casa Vallarta stuffs their gordita with meat.  You lose the lovely gordita taste. However  you get fed a good honest hearty meal.   Samuel C. likes good honest hearty meals.  I can totally go with this approach.  Key point. Many econo Mexican places cut corners on the chicken.   The competition gets old chickens from a cheap discounter.  I have been served those chickens both in SE Austin and in the exurbs and both in Mexican and Chinese places.    When you eat a cheap chicken your mouth feels dirty as you soon as you  leave the restaurant.  Casa Vallarta serves a high integrity product. Their chicken is a good honest chicken. So when they put a whole lot of it in the gordita  I am happy to eat the whole lot of it that is in my gordita.  Casa Vallarta also serves a superior horchata.  More cinnamon-y than usual .  Chips and dip are a weak point.  The chips weren t stale  but they were starting to turn middle aged. If they were humans  they would have been at the  stop-wearing-spandex  part of their lives.  Salsa was ho hum.  But I don t go to Mexican restaurants for chips and dip. I go to Mexican restaurants for a meal. Casa Vallarta turns out a good meal at a good price.  And if you go between the meal rushes  you can sit outdoors on the patio.  Sure the view is of Burleson Road and the Industrial Park across the street.  But they got trees. They got birds. The sun shines. You watch the traffic come and go.  There are a lot worse ways to spend a sunny afternoon.
Casa Vallarta,9,Authentic mexican food and cordial customer service. My breakfast plate was delicious. The beans had good flavor and the eggs cooked to the point that I requested. The potatoes were nice and soft.
Casa Vallarta,10,I have passed this little restaurant 100 of times and considered it insignificant. Until 1 day yesterday I saw it did have good reviews. So I popped in and gave it a try. The Beef fajitas tacos were cooked just right and so delicious I ordered some more and came back the next day. I plan on making this my go to for eating out during the work week. I wish I took a picture I could post but I already ate it LoL
Casa Vallarta,11,I came here For some breakfast tacos the weekend after Thanksgiving. They were very overpriced for some breakfast tacos but anyways there was trouble at the cash register with my card so the lady scanned it twice. She said I wouldn t be charged twice and I left with my tacos. Well bottom line is I ended up being charged twice called multiple times to talk to the manager about the situation and everyone gave me the runaround and told me the manager was only there in the mornings on the weekends. This is poor customer service I left my number with three people who work there and the Manager never called me so I ended up paying 80 for some breakfast that wasn t even hot when I got it.
Casa Vallarta,12,This place is over priced for what you get. 3 tacos 2 cokes 26 bucks. Really  Then they want a tip  Good one. Maybe they can use the overcharge money to fix up the shit hole 
Casa Vallarta,13,Incredible place for Street Taco   Stopped after spends Ng the morning and afternoon at McKinney Falls.  Unassuming outside  great service staff and awesome food   On the short list when looking for Street Tacos    Just wish they had a liquor license..... 
Casa Vallarta,14,This place does not look like a place I would normally stop at. It was my husbands idea and I went along. Our first visit was for breakfast in 2019 while we were staying at McKinney Falls State Park. They have wonderful coffee  On our first visit  I drank three cups  it was so good.We went back for breakfast every day we were at the park. The next time we were at that park  in 2021  we went back again for breakfast and dinner and we were delighted to find they have a small patio. We are now hooked.  We were back the first week of January  2022 and went there for breakfast   lunch AND dinner  different days .
Casa Vallarta,15,Food is very sincere. Place is very plain and needs a good cleaning although it smelled like sanitizer. Michelada was tasty  food was hot and tasty.
Casa Vallarta,16,When I came to this place  it looked very small and kind of run down- maybe even abandoned. But don t be fooled by the look of the building. The food there is amazing  True authentic mexican food    The chips and salsa were soooooo delicious I just couldn t stop eating it  I ordered a chile rellenos with beef inside and double rice. It was definately a great choice and my friend ordered some fajitas. Those were so good too  I would definitely suggest coming back for any of my friends who want a hole in the wall kind of place  so delicious 
Casa Vallarta,17,Stopped by here for a lunch and I m never in this area so I didn t know what to expect.  Well the service was great and the staff was friendly  although we were the only ones there .  The menu isn t too pricey  especially for the quality of food that you get.  I got enchiladas for about  10 and it filled me up. It comes with delicious beans and rice.  Immediately upon arrival we got chips and salsa  some of the best I ve ever had actually  My friend got a gordita and a taco and it looked pretty good.  I definitely would love to come again and try more of their food. It s so dang good.
Casa Vallarta,18,I really like their breakfast tacos. They have a migas taco that s great. Good green sauce  good beans  good tortillas but not a big fan of the menu  just the breakfast tacos.
Casa Vallarta,19,At first glance  the restaurant looks a little run down from the outside  but it s clean and welcoming on the inside. The menu consists of traditional Tex-Mex items  but also individual tacos  tostadas  and tortas. They have breakfast tacos before 11 00 and lunch specials that range  8- 9  and dinners that range  11- 16. Chips and salsa are free after 11 00 and the salsa is very good. It has a fresh cilantro  garlic  and roasted pepper flavor. There s also a green salsa you should ask for.  I had the veggie quesadilla lunch special  which came with rice  pico  sour cream  and guacamole. It was full of mixed cheese  onions  peppers  mushrooms  and zucchini. I liked the way they were cooked  with a slightly crunchy bite remaining. I found it to be a bit greasy  but no problem with a carefully placed napkin for the drips. It was all folded up with a delicious burrito-size flour tortilla. I ordered the beans on the side because they weren t included and they were like whipped refried pinto beans. Both the rice and beans were really good and not dry like some other places.  Overall  the prices seem to be a bit higher than many Tex-Mex places  but the quality is better than many. I ll be back for breakfast tacos or a lunch special.
Casa Vallarta,20,It s a dive Tex-Mex place. The food is still amazing. It s a block away from my office. We often call in for breakfast tacos. You won t be disappointed. I always order the bean  cheese with onion taco. My work wife orders the Carne Asada with cheese. Enough said. Please check them out.
Casa Vallarta,21,Coming from San Antonio  this place has sub-par breakfast tacos. The tortillas have no flavor and don t seem homemade. The small size of the tacos for  2.29 and up was disappointing from a dive. I ve been to plenty of dives that serve amazing breakfast tacos with flavor and at a great cost. Still on the search for some great tacos in Austin.
Casa Vallarta,22,02 16 19 Saturday night 7 15pm.  The place is nearly deserted  located in an industrial area but don t let that scare you. We are greeted from the back of the building  sit anywhere she says. Legit old school Mexican food. Not as good as my ama but good.  The salsa is nice and spicy like I make at home. Had the tacos al carbon with rice and beans.  Solid flavor the meat was pretty tender and the tortillas were well filled. Not carbon more like asada taco.  The beans and rice are good. Locals come in an out as we eat  the banter between the cook and the server was great. Like being back in my ama s kitchen.  Solid experience.
Casa Vallarta,23,Great breakfast tacos for a good price. I always pick up bacon  egg  cheese tacos on my way to work and they re always the bomb. Their green salsa is also on point. Best breakfast tacos in the area.
Casa Vallarta,24,Cute hole-in-the-wall place  I had the fish and shrimp taco on corn tortilla. The tilapia was grilled. There wasn t a whole lot of veggies in the tacos. They get the food out pretty fast so it s a good place for a lunch break. Overall  I think this place is simple and good.
Casa Vallarta,25,Real Tex Mex at reasonable price. I like the menu and the staff. A clean operation with a cultural flair.
Casa Vallarta,26,Really authentic Mexican food. Have eaten over a dozen times so my review is accurate. Very nice staff  clean facility. Awesome food. We have tried over half the menu and love it all. Thanks
Casa Vallarta,27,Fold we re super nice and accommodating to our large party. Cute patio seating  Tortas were yummy
Casa Vallarta,28,Like many other reviewers mentioned it is a hole in the wall.  Doesn t look like much on the outside and when you come in they staff are welcoming but the place on the inside looks.....a little worn aged.  That is the end of the  negative I have to say about this place.  My waiter was super attentive and friendly and did his job well.  The chips and red sauce are good.  If you want some extra heat ask for the green sauce it s very spicy and delicious.  I got tacos al carbon plate and some queso.  The fajita meat was great  seasoned well and tender and it tasted like a Spanish person made it.  Plate Came with rice and beans and they were what you expect.   It s priced reasonable  I wouldn t call it cheap or expensive.  It s on par with what other Mexican food places charge.  I had an excellent experience and next time I m in Austin I will come eat here.
Casa Vallarta,29,They have a few veggie options  amp  home made corn tortillas    The service is great   friendly and fast   Great lunch menu .
Casa Vallarta,30,Really solid Tex-Mex and great service. I m stoked that this place is 2 blocks from my office and can t believe I ve never stopped in.    I had the Tejano plate which was a crispy taco  amp  a beef enchilada for  7.99 on the lunch menu. Everything tasted great and no Velveeta. I will be back many many times.
Casa Vallarta,31,I got served a glass of water with what looked like dried chili flakes floating around inside. Unfortunately I only noticed half way through drinking the cup.  The place is gross  I m not going back.    Update - 24 hours later    I have been experiencing some really nasty stomach issues. Looks like I may have gotten sick from this.
Casa Vallarta,32,When you walk in and see the majority of the customers are airport workers on their break  and the airport is a good 15 minutes away  you know the food should be pretty good.  I found this gem on Yelp since I m in Austin this week for work. I ve been working odd hours so it s mostly been breakfast tacos for lunch and a quick trip to Denny s or Waffle House for a late afternoon dinner. I m staying at a hotel near the airport  and there isn t much around here.  Casa Vallarta is located in a food-sparse area in a growing industrial district. I had heard about the lunch crowds so I was prepared for a wait  but when I drove up at 6 PM  the parking lot was half-full.   As you walk in  this is nothing special. There are two dining rooms  and the inner has a TV with movies going. The servers were friendly and helpful  bringing out chips and salsa  HOT   and a menu. Although Casa Villarta is Tex-Mex  there is a nice variety of dishes on the menu  including Molcajete.   I ended up with the Poblano Chicken  pounded chicken breasts with onions  mushrooms  and chunks of poblano peppers covered in a jack-style cheese  and a crispy beef taco. The taco came with a stewy ground beef with chilis  which was very good.   I left sated and ready to take on my online accounting class. After the class  I will need several margaritas...
Casa Vallarta,33,I checked out this place for a different reason that I wanted to try. It s located in industrial business area. Glad I stopped here for lunch. Enchiladas and tortilla soup are excellent. The service was slow but attentive by servers.
Casa Vallarta,34,Absolutely love coming here. The food is fantastic and the staff is always great. I usually get the chicken tinga tacos and am never disappointed. Good selection of food and generally quick especially during lunch.
Casa Vallarta,35,Giving one star for multiple reasons  but mostly    Cost  It was expensive for   Mexican food. Almost everything was  13-15 per plate  tacos are  4  and only one size queso and guac  6   No cheese comes with you  15 fajitas   thats an add on of  1.50   and also you only get 2 tortillas  More tortillas cost  .   Food was just okay. Salsa was bad-they had to bring us more.   Not good for groups.  And loud  Tiny place.   Will never come again.
Casa Vallarta,36,The management at this restaurant is VERY poor when is comes to mistakes made on their end. I understand mishaps happen but when you work for a restaurant honestly any business your customer service reflects off your skills and the business thrives off experience. My coworkers made a order at this restaurant and when i picked it up it was a pleasant experience. But when i got to the office we all looked at our order to find it was not done as requested. I then called to explain the mix up we received hoping that it could be fixed instead the  manager  became aggressive and rude and asked me  Well what do you want... your tacos now or i give you credit another day   I told her this was our lunch in the office and the people were hungry so I d just go pick it up. Her reply before able to get a word in was  bring the tacos . Then she hung up  I was already driving that way and wasn t going to drive all the way back and interrupt our huddle meeting to recover  tacos . I get to the restaurant and the other waitress greets me by giving me one item i was missing and told me the tacos were coming out. Well the  so called manager  cuts in and is already acting as if she had no desire to be there or handle her job and asked  Wheres the tacos  i explained to her i wasn t able to bring them due to already being half way to the restaurant and not wanting to return to interrupt our meeting going to get the tacos she simply couldn t get right. She then told me no tacos no correct ones lol i then told her look i tipped you guys because of the service of working and taking the time to make my order but with that attitude I d expect it back if not only are we being charged for a messed up order plus for her to have a childish attitude because she cant handle a mistake being done and doesn t know how to deal with it appropriately then YOU shouldn t be working with customers period honey.   Working hands on with customers is pleasant and at its moments can test you but you must know how to deal with those situations. You cause money to come out the owners pockets having a stank attitude. Just cause its just 1 customer you upset ends up amounting to 2 3 5 and 10 eventually the restaurant starts to feel it in their sales. Theirs no excuse for your poor attitude honestly. Theirs mean customers in a field and lines of work you just gotta be EXPERIENCED to know how to handle them. To be upfront as upset as you made me over your dead beat attitude i still gave you respect because that s how grown people act. This restaurant needs to employee the right associates especially where all these business are at and we order to eat.
Casa Vallarta,37,I sound Bias just giving it 2 stars  but the fact is just that...We have had better. Are we picky when it comes to Mexican food  yes. At over 100 different ones in our belly  I feel we have the right to be. Seams that most people that have eaten here  are not even from Austin.  It has the whole dive thing going  which we both love. Service was decent   but lets break it down. Salsa was plain  flavorful  but lacked the Heat we desire. Chips were crisp  but small pieces to say the least...almost like they put the big chips on top...Queso was just a creamy cheese  but was helped out the 3-4 scoops of Salsa..Plates to include the usual basics when we hit a new place...Chiladas...Beef for the wife   Gravy  Chicken for me with Green Sauce...First the wife Always  Always get NO Beans  Double rice... -1 star when beans landed in front of her  and with the  Scrape and Re-plate   yet beans were still present..The Gravy was standard...Beef alone lacked flavor..As a whole bite...Beef  cheese and gravy it was alright. We both agreed  rice was better then most we have tried. I did enjoy the green Sauce on the chicken Chiladas  but the huge chunks of chicken  white meat  was tuff to cut thru  and needed the sauce to give it the flavor it lacked. If you read my reviews  Im personally a HUGE fan of using the whole bird  Like I do at Home  when making just about any chicken dish. Beans were ok. As you can see  we are just 2 people making our way around Austin  eating plates of Mex Tex Mex Food...and the Adventure continues..NEXT  
Casa Vallarta,38,Oh man...I really enjoyed my breakfast tacos. The breakfast taco s had so much flavor and reminded of the taco s that you could find in East Austin before it became gentrified. The tortilla s were good and the food was freaking flavorful  it was almost as good as my grandma s taco s. The coffee was also very good. I didn t know this place even existed but we were lucky to have found it. The flour tortilla s were good but didn t taste as homemade so that s why I gave it a 4 star...I d give it a 4.5 for sure. If they had that homemade tortilla I would have given it a 5 for sure. DON T GET ME WRONG...The tortilla were still good and better than some restaurants but just didn t taste homemade.
Casa Vallarta,39,Ordered 4 beef tacos all flour and all of them came in CORN. The meat was dry and really chewy. The tortilla was also store bought and crumbled into pieces once you bit it.
Casa Vallarta,40,Quick stop for lunch and quick it was   Great food and super fast service.  Looks pretty divey from the outside  but that just means it s good  
Casa Vallarta,41,Ordered one menudo to go  showed up 30 min later n the waitresses had to ask the kitchen over and over for my order. Maybe ten ppl sitting down and they already had their food. 20 minutes of waiting around and my order came out just in time for me to make it to work. It was delicious but took 45 minutes too long.
Casa Vallarta,42,Made the mistake of stopping here for breakfast I will never make that mistake again. The food was just flat nasty the eggs and meat were served lukewarm and the meat was so hard you couldn t chew it. Tasted like it had been sitting for hours before it was served. I wouldn t serve their food to my dog.
Casa Vallarta,43,I come here occasionally in the mornings after my very early morning shift at about 7am.  Sometimes there are people and sometimes there are not.  The servers are really friendly.  I ordered a huevo rancheros once and it was ok.  The real breakfast gem is the breakfast tacos.  There is a long selection at the bottom of the menu and it s priced nicely.  I ve had so many that you can t go wrong with most of them.  I recommend anything with egg or potato.  Mixed with salsa it s a great way to start  or end in my case  your day.  Beats eating outside in the cold morning wind.
Casa Vallarta,44,Carne asada heaven right here    Your mouth should already be watering. Trust me when I say that. Yes  you should drop everything this instant and go there right now. Awesomeness...and that s to say nothing of the service complete with cheerful faces.  All around awesome experience I m going to keep coming back to.  Best Mex in Tex  hands down    ....are you still sitting there   Burn rubber    I doubt it but what if they run out of food before you get there     Lol   I really don t have to tell you to  enjoy  because you re gonna.
Casa Vallarta,45,Had the fajita trio and chicken enchiladas verdes. Both were good and the salsa was nice and spicy. Our waitress was really attentive and friendly  which really is what I ll probably remember more than the food. Not crowded and definitely not a fancy place  so come as you are   
Casa Vallarta,46,I ordered 6 tacos and they got 2 of my tacos wrong and had the nerve to ask me to bring them that. I will not be coming back and all their employees do is sit down and eat nor do they greet the customers. And she threw my my tacos on the table and they just added what they missed up. I have never been treated with so much disrespect. My boss and other coworkers decided this is not the restaurant for us.
Casa Vallarta,47,Nice little restaurant with great food. Really enjoyed stopping here  food is exactly what you want when you are in the mood for Mexican. Food comes fast. Service is very friendly   Stop by if you re in the area 
Casa Vallarta,48,My gf and I stopped by just 15 minutes short of closing after finding them on Yelp. They were polite and welcomed us to stay as long as we wanted after getting our food as the restaurant closed.   The food was delicious. I had the chrispy tacos while my gf had the chicken nachos. The taco shells were light and flaky with good flavor  they tasted home made. The meat was great. The refried beans are really good too.   I didn t get the chance to try the nachos but sue seems to like them   Overall a great place. My mexican friend often tells me the less fancy a mexican place is the better the food is. It s definitely true for this place
Casa Vallarta,49,Service was great. I had the chicken fajitas lunch special and it was bland. This maybe very authentic  am but it s bland and boring in my opinion.
Casa Vallarta,50,This is one of my mom and I s favorite places to get breakfast. They re always super fast and really friendly. The food is always delicious. The Carne Guisada is the bomb. Their tres leches cake is so good. I ve even ordered to go and waited less than 10 minutes. I love this place 
Casa Vallarta,51,Doesn t look like much when you walk in  tables and chairs don t match  stained ceiling tiles  etc   but they were busy enough at 3 on a Thursday that parking was an issue. Service was extremely quick and attentive. Chips and salsa came out  and the corn chips were light and crispy  obviously homemade   and the salsa had a nice little kick  though I needed to add salt.   Had a beef taco and beef enchilada. Both were very good. Enchilada was cheesy  saucy  TeX Mex delicious. Beans tasted a little bit like bacon  never a bad thing . The rice was not very flavorful  but cooked well  and tasty after the addition of some salsa. I guess they used to be called jalape os.
Casa Vallarta,52,After reading other reviews I was a bit hesitant. I thought I would try it out and take a few friends because we were starving after a long night out. We got here around noon-30 so breakfast was over but I still wanted breakfast tacos. The server went to the kitchen to ask if it were still possible to accommodate my order and they were. I got two bacon and egg tacos and two chorizo egg tacos with cheese. The tacos were good  I was expecting bacon to be mixed into the eggs but instead it was on strip along side the eggs. The chorizo taco was made well. Orders around the table included fajitas  fajita tacos  burritos and barbacoa. After reading them previous reviews they say they were surprised at how good the food tasted. The tortillas were not homemade but delicious  Definitely not the plastic rubbery type I have encountered at other places. The vibe of the restaurant made me feel as though I was eating at my grandmas house. Not over done with stereotypical Mexican decor. It s small but able to fit my party of 6 easily. The service was great. The Salas was both flavorful and  had heat  contrary to other posts.   For the service  the price and the food...  I will definitely be returning to Casa Vallarta 
Casa Vallarta,53,Had the beef fajitas.... the corn tortillas will bring me back  I mean seriously. White  fluffy and flaky pieces of heaven. This hole in the wall is worth it    
Casa Vallarta,54,So I have been to my share of Taquerias in my life time and I have yet to order a Torta of Assad and have a whole flank of meat placed in between the bread. The meat tasted like it has been sitting out before it was cooked and trying to eat it was the worst part  I just gave up and the waitress didn t even attempt to ask what the issue was when she saw it placed at the edge of the table why ll serving the table next to mine. Very disappointed.
Casa Vallarta,55,I ordered a taco salad. They added very soggy  wet shredded lettuce. The liquid soaked thru to the fried big taco shell  amp  made the whole salad soggy  amp  yucky with a puddle of water under it. Pretty gross. But the salsa was very good.
Casa Vallarta,56,Came in for lunch  great beef fajita and enchaladas combo.  Service was fast and friendly.  Will be coming back
Casa Vallarta,57,Always tasty food but also always poor service. Fish tacos and chicken soup are delicious. Their enchiladas are ok.
Casa Vallarta,58,I am not from here  so I relied on other people s reviews in choosing this place. I had just gotten off a flight and was very hungry and tired. I ordered huevos rancheros. While the corn tortillas were great  it was just fried eggs  bacon and a side of retries beans with lightly seasoned potatoes. I was very underwhelmed. If it weren t for the very friendly staff I would have gone with 2 stars. Maybe this is a better lunch or dinner place.
Casa Vallarta,59,En route back to Atlanta and only a few miles from Austin s airport  we stopped at this quaint Mexican restaurant just off the interstate. Very happy we did as the staff  food  and atmosphere were as authentic and tasty as one can get. Highly recommended 
Casa Vallarta,60,Great little place with excellent service and tasty food.  If I m in the area  would stop by again.
Casa Vallarta,61,This is a great little restaurant to go to on a work day. It s not a destination for your family. The staff is warm and friendly and the food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable.  For about  1000 the owners of this facility could easily upgrade the interior appearance and make it more attractive and family friendly.  The dining area has no flooring at all  just concrete subfloor. Several ceiling panels are water stained  amp  need to be replaced  which would be very easy  amp  inexpensive. Finally- 2 gallons of paint would quickly spruce up the dining area. With proper scheduling of the flooring installation all these improvements could be done in a day or day and a half. Despite these aesthetic issues  I still really enjoyed the restaurant  if what I mentioned here were addressed  I would easily give it five stars it s a diamond in the rough as it stands.  If they do take my suggestion on the upgrades  I think they would recoup their investment quickly with an increase in customers.
Casa Vallarta,62,Casa Vallarta was highly recommended by co-workers and friends. I decided to go on my lunch break for the first time.   The experience was one of the worst experiences by far for me   I walked in  I was NOT greeted. I was unsure of  whether to seat myself or wait to be seated although it is rather small and the set-up is weird.  The four waitresses at the register did NOT acknowledge me I had to ask for a menu and tell her I was dining in.   She brought my order to me  it was covered in beans with a teaspoon of ground meat and NO silverware.  I had to get up go and ask for silverware. She replies with  oooh  she s not doing her job.  I don t know who she was referring to because she had been assisting me.  After that I was not checked on to see if I needed anything during my meal. All the while I am sitting and seeing how the waitresses are catering to the males dining in  checking in constantly  as well as bringing the check to the table.  I had to go back to the register to pay. This type of service is ridiculous. Needless to say  I will NOT be returning to Casa Vallarta 
Casa Vallarta,63,Tried it but probably won t be back here. It was only decent. Their beef fajita burrito was just a big taco  at least they put the rice and beans on  the plate. Salsa was just okay. Tea is expensive too.  15 for lunch.
Casa Vallarta,64,This place has the best authentic Mexican food I have ever tasted. From the chips  queso to the chicken quesadillas. Amazing food
Casa Vallarta,65,Food was decent. but prices are high  egg with beans plate 8.50.  during breakfast hour. not worth it
Casa Vallarta,66,Once again  a prime find through the wonders of Yelp.  While the aesthetics aren t much here  the food makes up for it.  I was in a group of 8 and received excellent customer service.  I ordered the enchiladas which did not disappoint.  We were the only  white  people in here but that always tells me that a place is legit.  Hope I m in the area again soon and I will definitely stop by.
Casa Vallarta,67,Food taste the way Mexican food should taste. Chips and salsa is delicious. My favorite are the green enchiladas  Servers always friendly never rude. The place is a small hole in the wall place but don t underestimate it.
Casa Vallarta,68,It s pretty decent but not worth the price tag on this food. It was like 70 dollars for simple food.
Casa Vallarta,69,Not having margaritas threw me off. Casa Vallarta quickly redeemed expectations. From cerviche tostada to beef fajita quesadilla  truly delightful. Cerviche was very fresh. Soup  carne gasada and  chocoflan  were equally amazing. Would recommend to anyone. Cheers.
Casa Vallarta,70,Classic simple delicious Mexican. Pretty sure they overcharged gringo me for my lunch combo and beer. But I m not mad. Everything was great and the service was excellent. Truly bilingual staff and hole in the wall location.
Casa Vallarta,71,I just moved to South East Austin and wanted to find a good  inexpensive Mexican food restaurant.  I found it with Casa Vallarta.  Great service  great food and not expensive at all.  The salsa rocks and the beef fajitas were amazing.  Not one person in my group was disappointed.  Go check them out  
Casa Vallarta,72,Absolutely lovely small family owned restaurant  both the burritos and enchiladas were fresh and delicious. The salsa was fantastic would absolutely be back.
Casa Vallarta,73,My girlfriend and I are here for breakfast plus michelada  and were blown away. Everything we had was amazing including the michelada and salsa queso.
Casa Vallarta,74,Found this little gem  while doing some work related training on the southeast side of town. The food was great as was the service. Love hole in the wall Mexican .
Casa Vallarta,75,Great Meal Great Price   Best true authentic Mexican Restaurant we ve eaten at in a long time.  Food was fresh and servers were outstanding.
Casa Vallarta,76,Great place for GREAT food  Authentic and always hot  mom even liked it    Great atmosphere and service 
Casa Vallarta,77,very bad service you better order out instead of dining in waited 1 hr to get my food plus you have to pay for chips and salsa my kid ordered chicken nuggets and they brought back really burnt food
Casa Vallarta,78,Great food  but  the owner is going up on the prices way to much almost four dollars for a tacos and almost 3.00 for ice tea and soft drinks oh my   
Casa Vallarta,79,Great beef and chicken enchiladas. Clean dining room. Friendly staff. Traditional Tex-Mex menu.
Casa Vallarta,80,Even after my wife annoyingly asked for a recommendation without giving him a single clue what she wanted  they were still nice to us and didn t spit in our food  i don t think . Now I gotta go back at lunch time and get the carne guisada lunch plate  I had beef enchiladas for dinner with their spicy green sauce  and the wife had a carne asada plate  both EXCELLENT. Excellent food  service  and people 
Casa Vallarta,81,Great mexican food and I found lots of low-salt options.  Even the chips and salsa are low-salt.
Casa Vallarta,82,Been here a couple times now. Food is solid  chips salsa are great. Fresh ingredients...service is interesting. Young  inexperienced servers  but they try and mean well. I recommend the chile relleno.
Casa Vallarta,83,Great TexMex in a no frills location.  Went here for lunch with some friends who work in the area.  Was not disappointed.
Casa Vallarta,84,Don t let the exterior scare you away. The food was fabulous  I ordered guacamole for my chips  amazing homemade taste  Ceviche tostada-delish  The server even brought me a fish taco since I only ordered something small  on the house he said  I m not from Austin but I ll definitely be back the next time I come here  It s real  authentic Mexican food  none of this Tex-Mex business 
Casa Vallarta,85,Walked from the Super 8 over to Casa Vallarta for dinner. Service was outstanding  Victor   and the food was delicious. I had the ceviche tostada   an al pastor taco and a fish taco. I d recommend all 3. Fair price. Definitely worth the walk.
Casa Vallarta,86,We were in the area and decided to stop since I will now be working close by. It was slightly over priced for the food ordered. Aside from this  the service was not great even though there weren t very many customers. The server did appear to have been busy before because he seemed rushed and there were dirty tables he was cleaning. He was friendly and welcoming and the food was out quickly. The food was very good  aside from the overpriced chile con queso. My daughter  who rarely eats much  loved the chicken fajitas. Overall  it was a nice and quick lunch.
Casa Vallarta,87,Great breakfast  never had cactus for breakfast  it was good. Close to the McKinney Falls State Park. Friendly staff and great service 
Casa Vallarta,88,Food was excellent and authentic   Service was great    If you are looking for good food and no frills then you have found your place.
Casa Vallarta,89,I visited for lunch and got the  7 lunch combo which is a burrito with rice and beans. If you want fajita meat it is 2.00 extra. When the waitress came and I told her I wanted beef  thinking it was ground beef  and got the bill  I found that I had been charged 2.00 extra dollars. When I questioned her she told me about the beef meat costing more  still thinking it was ground beef which I found odd considering ground beef is not expensive . My meal came out and it ended up being fajita meat  which I did not request . I made the comment to the waitress that I was under the impression it was ground beef and she laughed and said no. Needless to say I am pretty disappointed in the scam that occurred. I will not be going back.
Casa Vallarta,90,food is good but a little over priced and the waitreses have a habit of rounding your change up to the next highest dollar costing you even more thought it was maybe a one time thig but been there a few times and they have done it EVERY time
Casa Vallarta,91,food is good but watch your money  seems waitresses cant count very well  have been short changed enough times there that ive decided to not go back
El Super Taco,1,Great tacos   Very good service plenty of parking. Nice local artist mural. We will be back.
El Super Taco,2,If I ever leave Texas  I will absolutely miss the abundance of taco trucks at gas stations. I needed to refill my gas tank and figured I would grab a few tacos for lunch  while I did. This place accepts cash or Venmo  and they have the Cash App . They were sold out of the Al Pastor  which is normally my go-to. I opted for the Chorizo-Campenchano and the Shredded Beef tacos. They served the tacos with a green  I think vinegar-based  sauce and fresh limes. The tacos were delicious - I was partial to the shredded beef. They had other menu items  likes tortas and quesadillas. Great little spot.
El Super Taco,3,Tacos were definitely misrepresented. The pastor meat was more like the pork marinade that they sell by the pound at the super mercados.  The only thing they had going for them was the portion. I might just be a taco snob though.   They weren t terrible. Just not accurate or something to rave about.
El Super Taco,4,Amazing tacos  The perfect place for late night tacos. Some of the best street tacos I ve ever had. I got a steak gringas  tripa  pastor  and pollo tacos  all on corn tortillas. The tortillas  meat  onions  cilantro  and salsa were all perfect  and at such a cheap price  I would definitely recommend getting a gringas  the cheese made it so much better  There was also a guy selling Mangonadas and fruit out of the back of his pickup truck which all went perfectly with the tacos.   This place is cash only. I didn t realize until after our meal that there were pickled veggies by the truck next to the bottles of salsas.
El Super Taco,5,I REALLY wanted to like this taco spot.   It was my first time  I ordered a lot.... chicken  carnitas and goat tacos along with a Gringa and Gordita.   My order was ready a bit quicker than expected  only took a few minutes.   When I got home and bit into each item.  The meat was dry and or tough and the fried items were tough as well. It was to the point I only ate a bite out of each and had to toss the rest  which I hate doing and is not something I often consider .  It seemed like these ingredients had been sitting out for a bit before being assembled  Unfortunately  I didn t feel too hot the following day either.   So disappointed cause I wanted to like this place and enjoy at least one of the items.
El Super Taco,6,Saw the pictures  read the reviews everything looked good. I ended up getting some pastor and asada tacos... the pastor was pink highly colored flavorless meat totally opposite from a trompo style pastor. The asada was alright. I love the people that worked there  but gah the food killed me. Will not recommend going.
El Super Taco,7,So delish  Authentic tacos and the best service  Our tacos were hot  full of flavor and overall soooo good.
El Super Taco,8,I might need to rethink a lot of major life decisions. Probably I should have pursued a more lucrative career path  probably in technology. I should have invested heavily in Apple stock. And maybe I should have married one of the rich guys who I dated in my twenties.   My most recent regrettable life decision was waiting this long to try these tacos.   Let s talk tacos types  My boyfriend and I each had a steak taco  he had the Barbacoa and I had an Al Pastor.   This was...taco meat heaven  and I m a dedicated atheist.  The flavor of these meats was like something neither of us have experienced  and we ve put away some tacos in our day .   I would unequivocally recommend all three of these taco types  but my boyfriend lost his mind over the barbacoa.  I had to physically restrain him from immediately returning to get more barbacoa tacos. Now he is on the couch  giving me reproachful glances and whispering softly   barbacoa   as though remembering a lover lost as sea.   He also just informed me  very solemnly  with eye contact  gently clutching my hand   I am so sorry that you didn t order the barbacoa.    So he would probably recommend the barbacoa.
El Super Taco,9,Yelpers you have done it again  You have led me to the honey hole of tacos  this place is delicious.  I would give it 5 stars but have only been there once.  I am sure once i try more of their menu it will give them the extra star.  I ordered 3 of the pastor tacos  Mmmmm  they were delicious.  Served on corn or flour tortillas  with celantro  and onions  pieces of grilled pineapple  and a lime wedge.  They also give you a choice of green salsa mild  or Red salsa Hot .  The green had good flavor but the red was a little to hot for me.  The red tastes good but the heat sneaks up on you.  The food was good  the service was quick and good  but the best part...3 pastor tacos for  4.50   You can t get fast food cheaper than that.  This place tastes better and is cheaper  what a deal     Give them a try you won t regret it.
El Super Taco,10,I come here often because it s within walking distance of my apartment  and they never miss. Naturally  on some days their tacos are better than other days  but it s still a 5 star from me. However I ve only ordered chorizo street tacos from here because I like their chorizo meat way better than any other place I ve been at so I can t vouch for the other things on their menu. I m sure they re good though   The red sauce is really hot so beware if you re sensitive to spicy food  and their chorizo meat is already spicy enough for me 
El Super Taco,11,I had the pastor tacos and they were DELICIOUS  three people ate and had a drink for  16  can t beat that    Obviously there is no ambiance  you re in a carwash parking lot  just go for the food.  I was going to go today too  but blegh  the mist removes people s ability to drive.  Hasta martes  el Super Taco 
El Super Taco,12,I ve eaten here for years and have never been disappointed  When my friends come in from out of town  I take them here and they re always blown away by how great and affordable it is 
El Super Taco,13,We almost missed it due to its spot  it s disguised as an old car wash  but my family and I loved it. Would definitely recommend the Tripa Tacos and the Red Chile de  rbol Salsa  super spicy and delicious 
El Super Taco,14,TacoQuest2016 at El Super Taco  Jazzone and I recently went to a truckeria right in our own neighborhood that our friend Sheneneh recommend to us. It s on E. Oltorf near Burton in the parking lot of an old car wash. Pay attention or you ll pass it up and miss out.  They have all the things we both need so much now just to get through our week. The barbacoa and the al pastor were good  tender and juicy without being greasy or fatty and the pastor has a little spice to it as well. The corn and flour tortillas did more than just hold it all together  they were tasty and had a great texture. We ve had a lot of average tortillas lately and this was a nice change.   The tacos come with cilantro and onions as they should and there are there are also pickled  jalape os  and onions as well as onions pickled with what I think is habaneros.  The Bang vs. Buck measure is favorable as these are some of the most affordable tacos we ve had and although they aren t very big  we ve certainly paid more money for less taco. Everything combines to give this place a solid B and an an easy   for price.  El Super Taco opens late in the afternoon and gets busy quickly so if you re in the area you may want to check them out.

El Super Taco,15,Visiting from NJ so we want something local foods so we saw tacos truck so wow it is Very great Tacos with different meats   Very cheap    Very nice cookers  
El Super Taco,16,This is by far one of the best taco stands I ve had here on my visit to Austin. Amazing tacos  and Alejandro gave excellent service and recommend me the tacos al Pastor. YUMMY   1
El Super Taco,17,Fantastic prices as well as tacos. Highly recommend this place and basically everything on the menu. Open late but only accepts cash.
El Super Taco,18,As soon as you walk up you can tell it should be good by the smell.   The flour taco sizes are smaller in size  maybe the same size or slightly larger than a corn tortilla  but hey  it s only  1.50 taco.  I d have to that s decently cheap compared to other trailers -  3 taco what   I also took them up on the chopped onion and cilantro  they keep it finely chopped raw and not cooked so adds a nice touch .  Al Pastor Taco - had to try this based on the reviews.  Not too bad.  Good spice and sweet flavor at the same time.  Not the best I ve ever had though.  Desebrada Res Taco - had to google this one before I ordered.  To my knowledge it s just shredded beef...   Either way this was good and tender.    Taco - for some reason I got an extra taco  tasted like beef.  It was not my favorite - the meat wasn t really tender and it tasted a little bland.  Maybe you can figure it out by my pic.  Egg  amp  Chorizo breakfast Taco - nice and greeeasy.  They give a good amount of chorizo to egg ratio  meaning more chorizo than egg .  Al Pastor Torta - the torta bread was nice and soft so it mashed well  at the same time it was nice and toasted on the outside.  It comes with a good amount of cheese  lettuce  and what seemed to be a mayo based sauce.  I do wish there was more el pastor filling because everything else seemed to overpower it.  One tip  If you re like me and rarely carry cash  keep in mind this is cash only - unless you want to drive to the closest ATM and back   .
El Super Taco,19,I ve been coming here for years. Food is so delicious.  My go too favorite are the bistek tortas. You won t be disappointed. Everything is so delicious and the workers are friendly and so sweet.
El Super Taco,20,Best taco truck on this side of town    Seriously pick anything and everything it s all delicious. If you would only trust one truck in Austin make it this one  Drunk  sober  high it s good for everything   Omg I love them so much. El super taco por vida.
El Super Taco,21,Good street tacos. Something which I have missed since moving from Southern California. It was nice that you have the choice of flour or corn tortillas.  We went back during the day and it was a different truck in the same spot with a different menu. So make sure you are at the right truck 
El Super Taco,22,This is my favorite Taco stand in Austin.  So authentic.   Steak sopes are the best .  Their flan is perfect.  I love the outside eating area and happy disposition of the owner as he greets his customers.  Worth the trip.  There s a reason they are busy.  Worth the wait.
El Super Taco,23,Whenever I drive by this place  it seems like there are always a bunch of people out front  so I figured I better stop by and try it out.  For my first time there I ordered the Sopes  which came 3 to an order for  6.50z that s a pretty good deal to me  especially considering they were absolutely DELICIOUS. I ordered them with Asada. The issue with some sopes is that they don t stand up to everything that is on top of them and they get soggy. Not these though  these stayed crispy and throughout. I added avocado and got a healthy heaping of the awesome onions and carrots sitting in jalape o juice.  Seriously  probably the best Sopes I have ever had. I will for sure be back. Next time I am totally trying out the Deschebrada.  Also got the flan for desert. It was really really good. Not too sweet and not to heavy. I wouldn t have minded a little more sauce  but still very good. Highly recommend it.
El Super Taco,24,The carwash is a pretty good spot it s nice when you have cash since they don t have debit credit. The food is pretty great the usual wait isn t bad I d say check it out if around that area but again it s cash only which is the only downfall
El Super Taco,25,Best tacos I ve had in a long time... And my boyfriend is Mexican  so we eat A LOT of tacos
El Super Taco,26,Yeah super taco... super TINY taco paid three dollars for the tiniest tacos of my life   
El Super Taco,27,I have been going to El Super Taco for more than 15 years. Great tacos  good value. Nothing better than a couple of Al Pastor  Pollo  or barbacoa tacos and a cold beer.
El Super Taco,28,Mmm sopes  I m a fan of these things  so I ve had my fair share of  em.  The service was slow  but I guess that s what you get when they re made to order. Unfortunately  I wasn t able to sit down and eat them immediately  so by the time we got home  they were soggy due to the condensation within the container.  I was a bit disappointed because typically these have  crema Mexicana  on them... these particular sopes didn t. The chicken on them were seasoned very well and not at all dry.  Again  had I eaten them faster and not have let them get soggy  they would ve been better. But for now  3 stars will do as the food was good  but not mind-blastingly.  Definitely will come back and try again.
El Super Taco,29,I m a very lucky lil  guy  because I live right down the street from this taco cart. I ve tried most of the taco carts in the area  and not one of them matches up. The pastor tacos here will blow your mind  and they are only  1.50. Oh  and they have hot carrots   Which are a bit of a rarity  round these parts  and good ones  at that. Watch your ass around the container of onions with little bits of orange pepper floating around in them  unless you want it burnt off.   Only downside is that the hours are a little wacky  I don t think they open until around 8 p.m. but they re open until like 12 or 1.   Try these tacos 
El Super Taco,30,If y all want something that goes hard in the paint this place is where it s at. This place is the bomb dot com. Everything you order is made fresh.. If your as patient as me and don t mind waiting for a sec it s game time son. From the tacos to the tostadas even to the tortas and sopes. Best dinner choice on oltorf. Plus for the fellas their is a hottie with a body that s kills it in the kitchen game.. Thank you super taco for my dinner almost every other night.
El Super Taco,31,If I could give more stars I would.  I have been going to this place for forever and it is honestly my favorite taco place... ever.  It is never open for breakfast or lunch which is sad but it is open at 8PM til about 3AM. The tacos are priced really well  never more then  1.25-1.50 for the tacos.  Everything off their menu is generally really good and the people who work there are really nice. I like the al pastor the most  The quesadillas are good but the tacos are my favorite.  Be really careful with the hot sauce that is on the tables out there  it is SERIOUSLY hot  I only use 2-3 drops.. and it is fire in your mouth.  This little place is a little secret that I think everyone should try    there are a lot of taco trailers around Austin but this place is DELICIOUS  to say the least 
El Super Taco,32,thank mother of god for this taco stand and all the little taco making angels that are housed in there
El Super Taco,33,I haven t had anything here that wasn t delicious and you just can t beat the price. They sell tacos for  1.50 a piece and sopes for  2. I ve had the breakfast taco  the barbacoa  the al pastor  and their sopes  all of it was great. I recommend you order the sope  bien frito  and go easy on the salsa verde as it does have some heat to it.
El Super Taco,34,Easily best taco in Austin. Be patient  it s worth it. The pastor is heaven. For  1.50... TAKE MY MONEY
El Super Taco,35,their tacos r delish n i recommend coming here to eat....its very rare that i recommend taco trailers but this one i do recommend...the cooks r nice n the guy that takes the orders is helpful...try them  u wont b disappointed..
El Super Taco,36,I wish there were more stars to give    Oh myyyyyy  Seriously the very best thing in Austin. My bf and I go all the time.. Our favorite thing on the menu is their desebrada tacos    I moved her from Brownsville where we have the most amazing tacos ans this makes me feel at home. I have so much love for this place     
El Super Taco,37,Oh wow...well  maybe I should say  oh sopes    I m not vegetarian  yet I always ask for my sopes to have extra beans instead of meat.  These sopes are DELICIOUS  the very similar huaraches are too   and my favorites in Austin.  Believe me  I ve tried quite a few different places  and always come back here.    This place is a must-do for entertaining out-of-town guests who want to experience some authentic Austin...it s got a very  real  feel.  You pull into the carwash parking lot where there are a ton of other vehicles  hope you can find room at one of the 3 picnic tables outside  often asking to share one with other people--if there s no room  just sit in your car and eat because they won t be nearly as good by the time you get home   order those delicious sopes  and watch a few police cars go screaming by or the police helicopter circling overhead.  As you hear the sizzle of cooking meat and your mouth starts to water  people-watch the couples dressed to the nines  next to the family with three kids  next to the truckload of dirty  tired guys who just got off of work  next to the hipsters who just pulled in on pedal bikes.    I really do love this place.  It s not glamorous and surely not glitzy  but it has good solid food at very reasonable prices and it really IS my favorite place in Austin 
El Super Taco,38,Yep  as good as it gets and as authentic as it gets. It is my regular late nite stop on the way home. They are open from 8-2 am. The tacos al pastor are over the top. They add a couple chunks of pineapple along with the cilantro and onions. Tasty  tasty.
Curra’s Hyde Park,1,Curra s has its own distinct niche in Austin s Tex-Mex restaurants.  Given that there are 13 411 Tex-Mex restaurants in Austin - and that is just counting those north of the river    Having your own niche is quite the feat.         Curra s gets the prize for best artwork on the walls.  I don t mean paintings hanging in a frame.  I mean the whole wall painted  top to bottom.  Whoever the artist is should get free Curra s food for the rest of his life.         Curra serves a hotter salsa with chips and dips than Austin people are used to.  While I didn t particularly like the salsa in question  its called the  Red Salsa  at Curra s     I did have to give points for originality and style.  They do a CHIPOTLE salsa to beat the band.  I poured the Chipotle Salsa on just about everything.  I wouldn t have poured it on a three leches cake    But it was dynamite on everything else.         Chips are particularly flavorful.  Frankly  you don t even need dip with these babies.  These have a warm rich taste all their own.         Chicken burrito which is normally a pretty dull dish  Is just wonderful here.  While I was playing constantly with dumping Chipotle Salsa on top    The bare naked burrito didn t need any help at all.  Put that on the list with the chips for just having completely fine native flavor.         Now here comes the Headline Story.  Sit Down.  Stay Calm.  Are you ready for this                  My wife who absolutely hates Mexican food absolutely adored Curra s.  That is harder to do than getting her to like 1980 s Hair Bands or Harley Davidson Motorcycles.  She is vegetarian and does not eat cheese.  The token concessions to vegans at real Mexican restaurants leave her cold.  The imitation Mexican food at vegetarian restaurants leaves her even colder.  She gives ninety-nine thumbs-ups to Curra s Hyde Park.  What is the good stuff for her   a  She thinks the house green salsa is absolutely super.  She normally hates salsa.  b  She thought the Curras Caviar was the most interesting Mexican appetizer she had had in years.  c  She absolutely adored the Vegetarian Enchiladas that were full of both vegetables and flavor.  This is a woman who has forced herself to down more mediocre vegetarian enchiladas than anyone should have to eat in a lifetime.  After years of just tolerating the one dubious enchilada she can have ...  She found one that is actually wonderful.  It was like finding the right pair of shoes after a decade of having your feet slide around shoes that were too big or having your feet pinched by shoes that were too small.         Samuel C the omnivore thinks this is a solid interesting place.  His wife thinks this is the only decent Mexican restaurant she has eaten at in Texas  period.  With those endorsements  you really ought to check this place out.
Curra’s Hyde Park,2,I was so looking forward to having a good Mexican restaurant in the neighborhood  but have mostly been underwhelmed by most aspects of the new Curra s location.    To begin with  Curra s house tequila  Casamigos  is artificially sweetened  and it really spoils any margaritas made with it--so be sure and ask for any other tequila than Casamigos   It s a serious problem that Curra s does not tell its customers of the additives  and for me it s a real blight on their reputation that a beloved Mexican restaurant known for its authentic interior cuisine would champion such a terrible-tasting  inauthentic brand of tequila     Curra s Hyde Park also has a consistency problem with the quality of their food.  Last week  their signature relleno with picadillo and pecan cream sauce was the special  and the pecan sauce tasted as if it had been made using stale pecans on the verge of being rancid  or as if the sauce itself was a bit past its prime.    I have yet to experience a meal at this location that I could say was up to the Oltorf location s standards  although since we live in the neighborhood  and it s incredibly convenient for us  we have eaten there 5 to 7 times in recent months.  Some nights are better than others  but on many occasions the experience has been mediocre at best  and that includes the service.    I would rather not be writing this review  and this is more of an average of the experiences I ve had there  but I m really sad that this new iteration of a beloved Austin restaurant has yet to live up to its name.
Curra’s Hyde Park,3,Home of the avocado margarita  my party of eleven was promptly sat and drinks were placed as soon as we sat down while waited for the rest of the guests. The avocado margarita was delicious  frozen  thick  smooth  and tasty. We started off with some appetizers to go with our chips and salsa already on the table. Guacamole  ceviche  campechana. I thought both the ceviche and the campechana were going to taste the same bc they are both ceviches but they were both fantastic had 2 totally different flavors  I couldn t decide on which one I liked better. I was torn between the shrimp tacos and the shrimp Diablo  the server said the Diablo was must and she was not wrong  I didn t find it to be spicy but it had tons of flavor. Other people had tacos  mole  and pork leg. Everyone seemed happy with their choices. Ended with dessert  got the chocolate cake and churro cheesecake. Cheese cake had great flavor but a little dry. Very happy with the meal and will def come back.   One of my party members asked for a box and she was beyond excited it was not styrofoam and compostable. She wanted to make sure that noted in my review
Curra’s Hyde Park,4,I ve done the full tour de Al pastor tacos in Austin and Curras is definitely in the top 3  It has so much flavor and if you re going big the enchiladas are so worth it. They also have their famous avocado margarita that s so creamy and refreshing  it ll surpass all expectation of what it is. The staff is super friendly and the owner is always in and always in a good mood making it an experience to never forget.
Curra’s Hyde Park,5,Joe was the most amazing server ever     Get this man a promo. They have the BEST drinks  great atmosphere and fabulous quesadillas
Curra’s Hyde Park,6,Home of the Avocado Margarita Creamy but light Liked it  don t love it  Service was great  and food was good for the price. It was good but not great 
Curra’s Hyde Park,7,Very overpriced Mexican food. I m from Corpus so I know the flavor standards. Rice was a disgrace. We ordered two to-go margaritas that were like  13 each in a 16 oz plastic cup   gimme that 32oz If you re going break my bank like that  Don t get me wrong the vibe is great and we live in Hyde Park so we understand the allure  but come on. If you want good Mexican food just go somewhere else where you can trust it s legimately cooked and flavored back there.
Curra’s Hyde Park,8,You. Must. Check. Out. Curra s. I don t give out 5 stars that often but Curra s definitely gets it from me  We were seated in a reasonable amount of time  all of the staff we interacted with were very friendly  especially our waiter. The food was  chefs kiss  delicious  so good  I forgot to snap a picture  and there were many vegetarian friendly options. Curra s is  Home of the avocado margarita  - I had never had that before and it was really good  Love this addition to Hyde Park and can t wait to come back 
Curra’s Hyde Park,9,i ve been eating at Curras for years I ve known the owner he s an excellent businessman I can t say enough good things about their homemade delicious Mexican food it s always fresh it taste real made from real ingredients to perfection they ve only gotten better with the years I highly recommend recommend them for parties catering special date nights and great great food
Curra’s Hyde Park,10,Had a great time last night and enjoyed our dinner of nachos with chicken and a gorgeous snapper ceviche. Also had some equally delicious spicy jalape o margaritas.
Curra’s Hyde Park,11,Delicious mol . Nice avocado margaritas. Wonderful  other  margaritas. Several vegetarian options. A friendly attentive staff. Some outdoor seating.  An extra star for making we want to go right now just thinking about it.
Curra’s Hyde Park,12,Second time here and have had great service  Oli     was an amazing waitress. No wait time  even in a Friday night. Parking looks semi easy. Rita s are strong. Check their website for daily specials.
Curra’s Hyde Park,13,Ate here last night and everything was tasty  They were out of a couple of things  like fish tacos  which kind of sucked but the al pastor tacos were a good substitute. We tried the enchilada con chile colorado and I am very excited to eat my leftovers for lunch today.    We also tried the queso flameado. I would definitely get that again 
Curra’s Hyde Park,14,Our waitress silly was great. The ceviche   7  and mezcalita  5   is so tasty. Some parking but not much.
Curra’s Hyde Park,15,Great atmosphere   tasty food   friendly service  vegetarian friendly. Will definitely go again.
Curra’s Hyde Park,16,Love this sister restaurant to the south location  Street Tacos pastor are fire with homemade blue corn tortillas. Definitely stop by this location if you are in Hyde park area. Can t go wrong with this place     Frozen dot maragarita with jalape yo biznezz exceeded expectations 
Curra’s Hyde Park,17,We live a few blocks from this place  amp  love walking to restaurants  so we really really wanted to love Curra s. Sadly it was not so. A Wednesday night  almost 8pm  amp  the place was hoppin . A good sign  right  Not so much.  The reason was not bc it s a wildly popular place but bc the wait staff is badly trained  the kitchen is s-l-o-w and careless  and both areas are wildly understaffed. To start  our promised 5-10-minute wait turned into 20. Okay. A booth cleared  amp  the sweet but clueless server essentially wet-mopped the benches with a dirty rag  leaving behind a wet mess to sit on...also leaving a sticky sheen on our table  then didn t know what an IPA was  beer dear . 15 minutes after we ordered our food the server came back to tell us they were out of pork-whatever  so my husband had to re-order  that s fine  not server s fault   30-minutes later our food finally arrived -- we tuck in only to discover they had given me fish enchiladas instead of the Cajun Shrimp Enchies I ordered. Sigh. Another 10-15 minutes  amp  hooray here comes my real food  Which  sadly  was not worth the wait. Chewy tastelessness in a puddle of bland. What a disappointment on so many levels. No need to worry  tho -- Julio s is right across the street. We ll be going there from now on.
Curra’s Hyde Park,18,We really wanted to love this restaurant  as Hyde Parkers for almost eight years now  we re invested in the success of the businesses in our community. We re at Quack s every weekend  We always hit up Fresh Plus even though it s         We eat at every restaurant. But Curra s is a no-go.   Hear us out.  We went here--two times. The first time was pretty bad  but it was opening weekend  so we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. But you can t fool us twice. Let s start with some great things about this place  the gorgeous Hyde Park-themed mural in the bar area  So much to love and it s especially delightful seeing your neighborhood icons all together in one place  the avocado margaritas--the hype is real  They re delicious  the chips and salsa  which is nice and spicy  the mole sauce  NOT the entree  is really toothsome and special. Aaaaaand that s about it.  The first offense about this place is the fact that there is no waiting area yet the front room is 50  wasted space. Such terrible design and planning. So if you don t feel like waiting outside in 100 degree heat  you re awkwardly in the entryway. And if you do feel like waiting outside in 100 degree heat  There are no benches. Mother s managed to have a little waiting area  Terrible use of that front room with SO MUCH dead space.  Unbelievably we were sat at the SAME table both times that we went  a little double bench in that front room. BOTH times  the table and the bench were wobbly. The second time  there was a bunch of dirt on the windowsill adjacent to us. And they are using xerox printouts of menus  Seriously  Also unbelievably  we had the same waitress on both occasions  and while we re sure that she is a lovely human being  she is terrible at her job. She was flustered and spacey and seemed overwhelmed on both occasions  even when the restaurant was virtually empty on our second visit  and she screwed up two orders both times. Also  their staff is not required to wear masks FYI.  Food. Yikes. Got both sets of quesos  and while they taste OK  the second time  there were chunks of unmelted cheese which were just gross. The ceviche wasn t bad but the seafood was questionable  which brings us to the chicken. BEWARE. The Pollo Chipotle had a hunk of meat on it that seriously came out of a Costco freezer bag from 1985 and was so frightening that we did not eat it. The El Flaco salad seriously made us laugh  limp romaine  NO field greens as advertised   a few rotten tomato wedges and a couple soggy cucumbers thrown on top. Oh  and hope you like Kraft Italian dressing--because that s what it s served with. Our daughter got quesadillas  steak and cheese  both times  and those are passable. As stated above  the mole enchiladas have a great sauce  and we stuck to cheese this time around since we were so leery about the meat. It was OK  as are the beans and rice sides.  They have a paperless system here  which fine  we accept  but they don t even show you your itemized receipt first.   To say that we are beyond disappointed is an understatement. If you re going to open a Tex-Mex place against Julio s  then at least be better than Julio s  Even an elderly couple who was sitting next to us stopped to tell us that they thought the food wasn t good. Not only wasn t it good  it was pretty bad  and coupled with the horrific service and all the other grievances  we will not be here again for a very  very long time. We mean it when we say that we wanted to love this place  but we are missing Mother s more than ever. What a loss.
Curra’s Hyde Park,19,The food is so delicious just like the OG location on Oltorf. Same with drinks- some of the freshest margs in the city with house made flavors- try the cucumber marg   Our service was great- laidback but helpful  amp  quick to the table with our food. And they still have the super cool mural art inside from the previous longtime Hyde Park staple  amp  vegetarian TexMex restaurant- beloved Mother s Cafe  RIP   . If anything was to take over the space- this was the best hometown Austin restaurant to do so. 10 10. Love you foreverever  Curra s 
Curra’s Hyde Park,20,Excellent drinks  I m not a huge fan of the Avacado margarita  but there is a huge variety to chose from  The food is good  and the service is always great  I m a big fan of their enchiladas con Chile Colorado 
Curra’s Hyde Park,21,I don t know who  WC  is  but I would suspect we went to two very different restaurants if it weren t for the mural reference.  I also suspect their review and mine will indicate how far Cura s has come since their wobbly opening.  I ate there last night and it was a definite treat.  The service  both drinks and food  were quick and friendly  the street tacos and enchiladas were really flavorful and the drinks were tasty  avocado marg and paloma .  The owner was cruising around making sure all was ok and stopped at our table to chat.  We also sat in the bar area  as WC did  and the crowd seemed quite pleased to be there.  I m no culinary expert  but I ve enjoyed Mexican food all the way from here to Pijijiapan  and I ll be going back to Cura s for sure.  I agree the bar area will need a little tune-up  longer bar  soon  and I m eagerly awaiting breakfast service when they re up to it.  Maybe some of the difference is that  gasp   I wasn t a total fan of Mothers.  I m happy with the switch.
Curra’s Hyde Park,22,I never get enchiladas  but I decided to change it up today and got the shrimp enchiladas. I was SO happy with my meal. The chips and salsa were great too. I m very happy that I got the iconic frozen avocado marg. You don t taste the avocado much but gives it a smoothie texture rather than the typical icy texture. I will definitely be returning 
Curra’s Hyde Park,23,Nope  stale chips  chicken breast like shoe leather  feels like they are trying to save money on ingredient. Guacamole tasted processed. So bummed. Hoping for quality interior mexican... wasn t even ok for the price. Too bad.  Nope
Curra’s Hyde Park,24,I wasn t sure what to expect upon entering this wonderous establishment...  As I walked in I was greeted by a caring owner and host. They brought me to the back section to sit with one of their best servers... I can t remember her full name but it started with a Zoe.... she helped understand the menu and variety of everything they have to offer. The pricing is great on happy hours... outside of that it s completely affordable and well worth it in the end. I recommend avocado margarita or a Paloma or house marg but go check it out for yourselves and find your favorite. Food is delish as well  Will definitely go back again  Especially if this server keeps working here  The atmosphere is wonderful as well 
Curra’s Hyde Park,25,The food was good but the COVID protocols were terrible. Hardly any of the staff were wearing masks  there was no place to eat out doors  we had to sit in the crowded dining room that was closed in and no open windows. At a time when Travis County has over 100k cases of COVID.   I ll sit outside at Julios until COVID is over.
Curra’s Hyde Park,26,Great service  food  and craft cocktails. Glad this location is open now  Always a great time at curras south and Hyde park.
Curra’s Hyde Park,27,The frozen margaritas were amazing  we loved the option to get them in a pitcher too  I had the Pastor Enchiladas and they were incredible. The queso just might be the best in Austin. I ll be back 
Curra’s Hyde Park,28,I love this new location  the food and the staff.  I had delicious campachana  and an excellent margarita. I love that the music is not too loud and the place is very clean and has lots of space between tables. I ve been back twice and had the same waitress   Mariah  who is very competent and attentive.    I will be back 
Curra’s Hyde Park,29,Nice looking restaurant went there after the UT game  amp  was very pleased.  The food was great  amp  it was also the first time I ve ever had a avocado margarita  highly recommended    5
Curra’s Hyde Park,30,Love Curra s   Have visited original location various times since the 90s.  Great to have the Hyde Park location for those of us in north Austin.  Awesome food and attentive service.  Excellent craft cocktail menu and  of course  AVOCADO MARGARITAS     Congrats to the Garcia family with this new venture 
Curra’s Hyde Park,31,lots of menu options  quick service  good drinks  free chips  amp  yummy salsa. love this neighborhood spot for a texmex fix 
Curra’s Hyde Park,32,C mon Curras  your hostess and bartender weren t wearing masks  Had chicken tortilla which lacked flavor. Disappointed.
Curra’s Hyde Park,33,First time here but it won t be my last  I had a spicy margarita  queso  and chicken enchiladas. All great 
Curra’s Hyde Park,34,Great drinks  Great service  I have been going to the south location for years and thought I might try the new spot out. Just as amazing as ever 
Curra’s Hyde Park,35,I had ordered dinner to-go from what I thought was the Hyde park location - but turned out to be the Oltorf location. My mistake  However  all the staff and even the owner came to ensure my order was recreated at this location  Even though some menu items arent available at the Hyde park location . The quesadilla was crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. The enchiladas had very high quality meat. Friendly staff  great location  and satisfying food. Can t wait to go back 
Tacos Durango,1,I currently have the hiccups as I m writing this review because I ate too fast. This food was freakin  amazing  I ordered my meal through UberEats  which consisted of four tacos and two sopes  I got two bistec  two barbacoa  one sope with barbacoa  and another with chicken.  While all of it was delicious  the barbacoa sope was hands down my favorite. The masa cake itself was thin enough to not overshadow the toppings  yet thick enough to hold up everything without falling apart when you pick it up. The toppings were beans  barbacoa  cheese  crema  tomato  lettuce  and avocado. The ratio of all of those toppings were perfect  as I can taste all of those without one overpowering the other.  Although the sopes were my favorite  don t misconstrue this as an implication that the tacos weren t as good. They absolutely are  my only mistake was forgetting to request corn tortillas  as I m not the biggest fan of flour tortillas. Also  their salsa roja and salsa verde are  The green has a fantastic flavor  and relatively mild on the spiciness. The red is freakin  delicious  with a heat that is simultaneously instant and slow to creep up on you. As I m eating it I get the flavor of the chiles used while tasting their spice. But a few minutes into eating  my lips start to tingle. A rule of thumb for the perfect hot sauce for me and my boyfriend is that if it s spicy enough to give you a runny nose and tingle your lips without sacrificing flavor  then it s a winner. And their red salsa is just that   After having been in Austin for a few months now I am so glad I ve found a great restaurant for sopes and tacos  especially considering the phenomenal flavor and affordability.  TLDR  If you re looking for great tacos  sopes  and salsas  go here  You won t be disappointed  Get the barbacoa sopes and thank me later  
Tacos Durango,2,Love their tacos   Homestyle potatoes on tacos are my favorite   Tortillas cooked to perfection 
Tacos Durango,3,Probably the best tacos I ve eaten in Austin. I ve also eaten their Mexican Shrimp Cocktail before. I ve first heard of Tacos Durango years ago as an Uber Driver and had pickups deliveries several times a week. Yesterday  however  I had a chance to get a couple of tacos from Jessie  the owner s truck  and it was Utopia  I first had a bean  cheese  amp  bacon taco and it was so wonderful I went back to get a second one  This time I had the chicken mole one. Fabulous   And also I will add they are very inexpensive. Must either go to the store or find the truck. You will not be disappointed  
Tacos Durango,4,Best breakfast tacos I ve had in Austin. On Sundays when they are closed  you can get similarly good tacos at Taco Miendo in a Chevron on Parmer and Lamplight Village.
Tacos Durango,5,The best tacos EVER closest thing you ll find to Mexico  Quick and convenient. So delicious. THANK YOU   amp  they have multiple locations.
Tacos Durango,6,I love this spot  They open at like the crack of dawn  5 Am almost every day   Usually I m pretty skeptical on eating food out of a gas station  standards out the window .  Instead of junk food  this place is like a tiny kitchen right inside the store.  They usually have breakfast tacos ready in the morning  but I like extra goodies on mine so they cook mine fresh on the spot.  Decently priced  and super convenient  I drive from 10 min away just to get tacos from this place  even though I have plenty of options right around the corner .
Tacos Durango,7,The carne guisada  rice  and beans  was very pale  Bland  and lacked flavor. Needed to add salsa and salt to give it some decent flavor.  The tortillas were decent. I will not go back again. Carne Guisada Plate
Tacos Durango,8,Charging  after 11am  price for bean tacos listed as  2 under breakfast taco at 10am. Very argumentative about the 4 shreds of cheese costing them 50 cents.  There is a 2.50 piece of paper above the migas that one would assume applies to the migas. They insisted that was their notice for the price.  Refused to refund money when I was asking about the difference  I had handed my card and they d run it as they mentioned the price  Food is good  but just yikes on the customer service. The receipt specifically says  breakfast taco after 11am 
Tacos Durango,9,This is seriously a hidden gem in Austin    I was blown away with how good of a quality and the price of this place. Truly an amazing breakfast taco    I had the chorizo with egg and cheese and suasage with egg and cheese and deeply regret that I didn t take pictures  Planning to make this a weekly to go for tacos as it is that amazing   
Tacos Durango,10,I really wanted to like these tacos  but unfortunately they weren t very tasty. Staff was rude too
Tacos Durango,11,These are the quick breakfast tacos you have been desiring   Large over stuffed and only  2  Chorizo  Potatoes and migas are very good 
Tacos Durango,12,Oh man - amazing breakfast burritos. We decided to try this place  just wanting something different thank Tacodeli  and this is wayyyy different  and sooooo good.   Inside the Chevron  but don t let that deter you 
Tacos Durango,13,This restaurant is located inside of a gas station  I heard they have excellent breakfast tacos but I have not had them. But I will say that the beans and rice that come with the enchiladas are delicious. I got chicken enchiladas with green sauce  the chicken was kind of dry  Same with the tortillas. There wasn t much sauce on top but there was a bunch of cheese. I think this place may be better for tacos than meals. But overall not bad
Tacos Durango,14,Ordered through Grubhub to pick up some food today.  This place is tucked inside of a gas station  its a bit small but large enough to have tables for its patrons.    I ordered my food with a few customized changes and was very pleased that when I went to pick up my order at the scheduled time  it was hot  fresh  and exactly as I  ordered. One staff member seemed a bit preoccupied while another was very nice.   I ordered    Burrito  2  I chose chicken and added additional chicken  I also asked for no rice or beans which they honored.  This burrito is huge   There was a lot of chicken - because I asked for additional  and it was wrapped very well  not messy. Very delicious and worth every penny  Only complaint is there could be a bit more veggies and guacamole but other than that - very pleased with this   Taco  2  I ordered one Bistek and one Pastor  both with extra meat. I also requested cheese on these. Both these tacos are delicious  Both proteins are perfectly seasoned and well balanced with flavors. If you want extras like veggies or such - you must request it and it costs extra. But for the price I paid  you cannot beat this taco.   Breakfast Taco  I ordered the Bacon and Cheese  added potato and extra bacon - for a small fee.  They filled this taco up  Very good   Green Salsa  Not as spicy as I thought it would be and has great flavor  Red Salsa  A bit spicier than I thought it would be and more bland in flavors.   I prefer the Green Salsa.    I will definitely be coming back to this place for tacos - good quality  big quantity  worth every penny and for the most part - Good Customer Service 
Tacos Durango,15,Quick place to grab breakfast tacos on the go. Its right by acc northridge and I go right before my class. It s a small place in the gas station but also has tables inside.
Tacos Durango,16,What you think is just a gas station turns out to be a great taco spot in Austin. The breakfast tacos till 3PM is why I go but the salsa is why I keep coming back  Go check em out the authenticity won t disappoint.
Tacos Durango,17,They Used to be a Great Deal  NOT a DEAL any longer  They ve raised prices 30-40   You still get a nice portion on most foods but again as prices are up so much and food quality is just Ok.  I won t be ordering again. Better deals out there.  Like Brazos Tacos for one 
Tacos Durango,18,By far my favorite taco place. Hidden inside a convince store this is a gem. Great tasting food and great prices   Customer service could be better but I believe it is due to a language barrier.  Everything from their breakfast tacos to their burgers are delicious   
Tacos Durango,19,Hands down my favorite Mexican food in North Austin. A little back story. I began delivering adult libations to the convenience store in the same building around 8 months back. I was at first skipping over this hole in the wall mostly because I was getting food at other food stands off Howard.     One fateful day I was almost two hours ahead of schedule. So I took a few minutes  or 30  and had lunch here. No recommendations just picked an item from the menu that I like at other establishments and order three of them. Bistek a la Mexicana tacos. The meat was succulent and tender  cooked and seasoned perfectly. The onions and jalape os were nicely grilled just the right charring. On a soft corn tortilla browned on the grill. Exceeded all expectations. This relationship with tacos became a habit. Such that I was modifying my route to extend time I could enjoy them more than scarfing them down. On several occasions I ve had them togo  but I prefer the quaint  although often busy atmosphere of this cafe to the cab of my truck in traffic.    I ve been trying new items every so often. I was told of a Chuletas special and so I tried them. Hit the spot and even raised the bar I know have when it comes to Chuletas.   I ve had a burrito or two  or twelve. I stop here every Wednesday without fail. Depending on my route and timing of course.   The service is always fast  friendly and over the top. The ladies behind the counter will answer any questions you may have. The owner is a solid upstanding gentleman. He s open to conversation and even looking to expand down the line. I suggested buying an old sonic and doing carhop tex-mex food. Sonic with a Mexican food flare. Genius idea I know huh  Anywho.   If you re looking for something well seasoned  cooked with care  and very affordable  you ve come to Taco s Durango. Side note  one of the ladies behind the counter told me their orange sauce  by request only  isn t asked for by very many people. Except for me of course. When they ask Red or Green. Say Orange  with confidence. As long as you enjoy Hot and Spicy orange is the only way to go.   Don t let the cooks demeanor get you down she s not really that mean once you get to know her. She s the devil. Jk. But she can take a joke. That s good cause I gots the heavy blood.
Tacos Durango,20,Los tacos and torta cubana are my favs  The migas tacos with corn tortilla are the killers  I proudly recommend this food spot bc of their tasty and fresh food. Well proportioned   excellent value make them a great spot to eat when you are in a hurry. Very convenient location  inside of the gas station  you can always go inside and get your favorite Jarritos  flavored Mexican soda  while u waiting for ur food .
Tacos Durango,21,Great breakfast and great lunch. To everyone saying the staff is mean  y all too sensitive.
Tacos Durango,22,The tacos at Durango Tacos are great but the Morning staff  2 ladies  are RUDE    They look at like you are bothering them when you order. They would be better off hiring a new crew. We had to walk out because of the way they spoke to us. Almost as if we were beneath them. I ll never go back as long as they are there.
Tacos Durango,23,I found this place by looking at all the other Yelp reviews. They re right  This food is VERY good.   What I particularly like is the ability to order a bag of tacos online and swing in to pick  them up when I m in a hurry   Note  many reviewers have mentioned the yummy a la Mexicana beef. It s delicious  but be warned  it is spicy. Not for the faint of heart.
Tacos Durango,24,I have wanted to try this place for the longest time and I m SO glad that I finally did  I grew up in Arizona where we have seriously discerning taste for Mexican food. My husband has lived in Austin for 30 years and also has a precise palate. Tacos Durango delivers 100 . I ordered two egg and bacon with avocado and two egg and chorizo for me and my husband to split. The food was DELICIOUS  I could tell that the corn tortillas were handmade and  oh man  all the filling was incredible. I have no idea why some reviews say that the customer service is bad. The staff was super nice and I will absolutely be back  we re planning our order for tomorrow . I stand behind this place and we will now be regulars. Give these guys your business - you will not be disappointed 
Tacos Durango,25,I live around the corner from Taco Durango. Never went there till 4 weeks ago. I have bought tacos there since. Very good and filling tacos. Homemade flour tortillas. I would prefer a more traditional salsa  but the green and red salsas are good even though they are a bit spicier than I would like.
Tacos Durango,26,After 3 years of vising this place for breakfast tacos  and I  having great conversations with the owner at Taco Durango on Metric  the lunch staff would treat us with no appreciation or even a smile or thank you after we repeatedly said thank after asking for salsa or even on the way out  No acknowledgment  needless to say we had a very bad first lunch experience especially with the girl in red shirt.
Tacos Durango,27,Was excited to order my tacos  But when the lady approached me she already looked like I was bothering her  Then she spoke to me in Spanish with such a rudeness like I was beneath her. The tacos are good but not worth the disrespect  Adios taco Durango  Going down the street for my tacos 
Tacos Durango,28,OK  so from my previous reviews you can see its been a bit of a struggle for me with this place. But I think after after today  there is  literally  no going back. Yes  it saddens me to say this.. but it is what it is.   The customer service from these girls is horrendous. Honestly. The one girl who speaks fluent English is FAR more pleasant than the other  smaller  girl who typically takes my order...however  they both are enough to drive you mad in the morning.  A customer should NEVER feel as though they are a burden or inconvenience... That s just not right...   I ve pretty much had it. Aside fro the poor customer service the wait on the beans today wasn t terribly bad at all  and I agreed to wait  she did offer something else  but I didn t want anything else...I m not a big meat eater. so I chose to wait..   The beans were a little hard  and a little dry. The eggs tasted  eggy  for the second time  I thought this was just me one day   but no.. its the eggs... they taste super cheap.. and they aren t that good.   The Yes  the price is hard to beat.. but quality  good customer service  and an overall pleasant experience  is not THAT hard to find..   Take JR s  just down the road  for instance...   They charge a few extra cents for their tacos   BUT their flour tortillas are better their eggs are a NICE scramble with a good taste their beans aren t quite as bland and never hard dry you get more filling in each taco   and their customer service has NEVER failed. NOT ONE TIME...   I ll take my business there.. they appreciate it more and their food is better.   It s a shame Taco Durango.. I love to support small local businesses  but something here is going to have to change for me to come back.
Tacos Durango,29,UPDATE  They are still amazing      I m always on the lookout for new new to me local businesses  amp  restaurants to try out. I got the craving for delicious breakfast tacos without the delicious breakfast tacos lines. So I looked on Yelp and this place was one of the first ones to pop up. Its inside the gas station in the shopping center. They have a little restaurant set up and the manager  maybe owner  said hello and welcomed me.   I got the migas taco and chorizo taco. Oh... my... gosh. They were delicious. There is something about knowing your food is legit made right after you order it. Hearing all the ingredients sizzling on the grill was pretty cool.   Oh  and did I mention the cost is super reasonable    I highly recommend 
Tacos Durango,30,Ordered from the Eat24 app and was able to call in and adjust my order when I made a mistake online.  The people there actually waited past closing for me when I hit traffic  they went the extra mile for me.  On top of all that  great food.  Had tacos and a burrito  lots of food and it was tasty.
Tacos Durango,31,They have some of the best tasting Mexican food in North Austin. Whether you re looking for a good quesadilla  gordita  taco  breakfast taco...  they even have great burgers ...this place is definitely worth the trip.   I ve never been disappointed in the quality of the food or the price portion. The food is very delicious  I recommend the quesadilla plate   
Tacos Durango,32,They have really good breakfast burritos  every time I go there I get it and I m a happy customer  
Tacos Durango,33,Omg  Yo  I m a delivery driver and pick up here all the time but finally tried two tacos and boy  they were hittin   The flavors were poppin   I definitely suggest trying and taking some to work  
Tacos Durango,34,One of my favorite taco spots in Austin  my go-to since Chetos closed. Al Pastor and Bistec a la Mexicana are incredible. They re also quite a bit cheaper than most places these days.
Tacos Durango,35,A great place to pick up breakfast tacos   It s next door to me and I m not one to walk into gas stations looking for good food but this is different. Though this place may be tucked into a gas station establishment  it is it s own thing  A good thing  I m leaving 4 stars for now because I haven t had the opportunity to try anything besides the breakfast tacos at this point. The breakfast tacos I ve had quite often and they are always delicious. They don t skimp on the cheese which is important to me. Always fresh 
Tacos Durango,36,Really great breakfast tacos  Only 99  and made with homemade fresh flour tortillas and salsas   Best deal in Austin  For those picking on the service calm down...this is a small business and they are doing a great job  I don t see your arses up at 5am prepping food for the masses. Support local and be happy    Call ahead for large orders  
Tacos Durango,37,Love the food but the staff is rude to me every time I walk in. The mother and father are awesome but the girls making my food I am not fond of. I even leave a tip every time and they don t even say anything. I feel like sometimes because I am not Hispanic. Sucks because the food it good. But I lost respect for how the backend runs their business
Tacos Durango,38,Their migas tacos... best in Austin    My bf and I come here every chance we get. The tortas are huge and the quesadillas are enormous and stuffed with meat  cheese  lettuce  tomato  avocado  and sour cream. So yum    
Tacos Durango,39,I m pretty sure everything they make here is sprinkled with crack. It s so good  Cheap and delicious   Come by sometime and get tacodrunk 
Tacos Durango,40,Oh  this place is so good. I am addicted to their homemade corn tortillas  the bistek  and barbacoa. Seriously the best you will find on the north side. Try them  You re welcome.
Tacos Durango,41,You re wasting time reading this. You should be there already. Stop reading. Go. Go now. Buy everything. It s literally  yes  literally  all good. All of it.
Tacos Durango,42,This place is great  I used to go in here almost every day until I moved. The tacos are fresh and they even have a mobile truck. I wish the truck would come over to my new job   
Tacos Durango,43,Cruising North Austin looking for breakfast  I decided I wanted a breakfast taco after 11am.  Using yelp search  and inspired by the inviting urinal pic posted by Phillip B.  I decided to visit Tacos Durango  inside the Metro Chevron on Metric.  Like usual  despite their name  the menu includes much more than tacos  enchiladas  tortas  even menudo on the weekend.  And food doesn t get much fresher than hearing the sizzle of my eggs being dropped before I had even paid.  It s the little things...  The gal taking my order  when I asked about the potatoes  sincerely said they would make them  as crispy as you d like.   She did hard sell the  special steak and egg  taco  with its exorbitant price  at twenty whole cents more than a standard breakfast taco.  I wasn t sure where I was going to find the  1.59 for it without hitting the ATM.  But man was it good.  My gluten free wife will probably love the homemade corn tortillas.  Flour tortillas are brought in  And the red salsa is great.   Service was so fast that I walked in  placed my order  grabbed it  went back to the car  though there are tables inside   drove home  chowed down  and enjoyed the salsa-induced burning on my lips while drafting this review  probably before some of the Cafe Java fans next door  sweating in the sun  got seated.   Yeah that may be a slight exaggeration  but I m happy to have found Tacos Durango.
Tacos Durango,44,Have been multiple times and it was good but went there yesterday and got moldly avacados on my tacos  won t be returning ever again. Inexcusable.
Tacos Durango,45,Wow this place is amazing  I had the Carne Guisada Plate today and the meat was cooked to perfection  the was very tender and moist with huge portion sizes. I will be coming back.
Tacos Durango,46,Best food in town. The quesadillas are amazing  big enough for two people. You really cant go wrong here  everything is good.
Tacos Durango,47,This place serves breakfast tacos all day.  I ordered 3 breakfast tacos  bacon egg cheese  bean  amp  cheese.   The bacon is more like bacon bits. I prefer strips of bacon.  The migas taco was too salty.  The beans are bland and dry.  The service was bland and dry too.  I probably won t go back.
Tacos Durango,48,Authentic for sure  I usually get breakfast tacos or a burrito and haven t gone wrong with either. Big plus that I can reliably order from yelp app on my iPhone. Always smells yummy and it seems like business is so good  they stay busy.
Tacos Durango,49,I agree with everyone on the food. Some of the best tacos I have ever had. I eat there practically every day as it is around the corner from my job. The customer service here is beyond terrible  There is a lady who works behind the counter who acts like she hates her job and it shows in how she treats her customers. One day  she took my order and asked me specifically what type of shells  corn or flour and then proceeded to cook my order 8 minutes later giving me the wrong shells. I think she did it on purpose to be completely honest as there was a lot of emphasis on the type of shells during our conversation. Normally if the customer service is bad  I won t return to a restaurant but in this case  she isn t the owner and I have to assume that she is just an overall miserable human being anyway  They should fire her and find someone who acts like they care even a little bit.
Tacos Durango,50,My mom and I have been going to this place for 3 years  now. The food is DELICIOUS   Go and check them out   You will be back for more   I read a review about the service and the girls there. Honestly  they could use a little polishing up in that area.  They COULD be a little more welcoming  however not even their lack of smiles will keep me from the great food they prepare 
Tacos Durango,51,I think they gave a little bit more than above average service. My first time here and they helped me out. The torta was ok  the tacos were either too dry or salty for my taste. Tacos in Houston are much better  I can say it s a bit overpriced for this quality  1.85 per unspecial taco. They got stars mainly for their service to me.
Tacos Durango,52,saw the sign that read  HOMEMADE TORTILLAS  and i made a bee line for it. Walked in and lo and behold the sweet lady at the counter had a ball of masa  thank all that is delicious  so i got some breakfast tacos to go and there were 2 options. you can watch her make yours or she had just made some and put them on the rack in front of the register. yes they are premade but they are fresh so no ill feelings. the lady is super nice and quick with making them tacos  Hells yeah  today is a good day  i found another good breakfast taco spot 
Tacos Durango,53,Located inside the Metro Food Mart by Cafe Java  this is a perfect location for Durango  3.  If you don t want to wait for seating at Java  grab a coffee to go and mosey on over next door.  Here you will find a clean grill  friendly service  cheap prices  and full menu all day.  Their breakfast tacos are cheap starting at  1.39.  Their breakfast plates run around  3.99.  Lunch offerings are tacos  tortas  quesadillas  gorditas  enchiladas  burritos  burgers  fries and wings.  The most expensive thing on the menu is the enchiladas plate for  6.29   Not bad   As I stated earlier this is inside a convenience.  The store is staffed with friendly folk.  Today  while I was in  I was yelping pictures and the clerk  Nick  saw me  and asked that I take his picture.  He ran over to the Budlight display and started posing   How could I resist    Friendly  fun atmosphere with dang good cheap food.  Durango  2  which is also delicious  is the trailer on Lamar Parmer.  I ve yet to find Durango  1  but  I know it is somewhere on Lamar near Rutland.  Also to note  I prefer the red sauce to the green.  One last good pointer   if you are in a hurry  or have  a big order  call ahead  512-973-9344  and they will have it ready when you arrive   Hours are Mon - Sat 0600 - 2000  Sun 0700 - 1400.
Tacos Durango,54,I had the veggie quesadillas. It was pretty tasty. Good portion sizes. This is a place to catch a quick bite.
Tacos Durango,55,I enjoy getting a torta from this place. It s affordable and they re not bad tortas also their quesadillas are pretty good. It s also very cheap I pay  5 something for a torta. You can also call in your order and it usually takes like 10 or 15 minutes. It s also inside the Chevron and convenient because you can buy a drink at the gas station. Also if you re a whiny little bitch you probably won t like it. The torta I get is good but not the best torta I ve had. I m still a fan though.
Tacos Durango,56,This is a great stop for breakfast tacos. I stop in roughly 3 times a week since it s on the way to my office. Hint - pick the tacos that are already made for 99cents. They are all made that morning so they re still fresh and you don t pay the 1.39 per taco and wait in line. Also  the salsas are really good  green is always fresh with a bit of spice  and the red is smooth with a hint of garlic in there. Reminds me of the red you d get in New Mexico or Colorado. Keep up the good work.
Tacos Durango,57,The best authentic Mexican food I ve found in Austin thus far  They have so much to offer. I love the hamburgers  gorditas  tortas  and the wings  which they have a special on Wednesday . The prices are more than affordable   I can go in and literally pay with change from my purse  They have several handmade sauces that are hot yet edible  try the green  amp  or habenero .
Tacos Durango,58,Made to order breakfast tacos.  In a gas station  so best taken to go.  If you live in one of the nearby neighborhoods it s the closest  quickest place I ve found for picking up fresh breakfast tacos.  Will go again.
