1,"I came here with family that was visiting in town and we really enjoyed this spot! There was a decent amount of indoor seating, so we didn't have to roast on the porch (though it looked like the shade and fan placements out there would have been adequate). The food was quite good! My chicken enchiladas were moist throughout and I enjoyed the green sauce. I especially enjoyed the chips and salsa while we waited for our food, and our server was kind enough to offer us complementary Sopaipillas after our meal.<br/><br/>Surprisingly there's a lot of very mediocre Tex-Mex to be found in Austin, so when you find a place with some quality you remember it. I'll be back!"
2,"Reviewing from perspective as a W from Santa Ana, California where we have Mexican food possibly more authentic than San Antonio's south side? (see other reviewer)<br/>Vamonos is certainly above average Mexican food. Their Margarita is very nice and the guacamole is slightly chunky while still smooth and very tasty. The Chicken Adobo was excellent.<br/>On a Saturday evening there were mostly caucasians dining, but no one was talking about the National Review. I doubt anyone there that night would even know what it is. There was a Hispanic couple and a mixed couple, but does that even matter? It's a satisfying restaurant and I recommend you try it for yourself."
3,"I used to come here a lot last year and the customer service was much better. <br/><br/>I'm writing this review NOW because I just sat outside on the patio (with a dog) for almost 30 minutes before anyone came to take my order. And it wasn't a server who finally saw me.<br/><br/>The food has always been just okay. I come for the margaritas and location. It's a nice, little dog friendly spot."
4,"I'll leave two reviews; one from the perspective of those who leave this place 4/5 stars and one from me, a Chicano from the Southside of San Antonio.<br/><br/>Im other words, I'll review Vamonos from my perspective (M) and ""Let's Gooooo"" from the typical reviewer for this place (W) in a short two person play. M- &amp; W- denotes who's speaking. <br/><br/>*******<br/><br/>M- As soon as you walk in to the place, I could kind of tell it wasn't for me. The bustling chatter of chisme and the excited clinks of beers were gone, replaced by conversations re: stock prices and some article that came out on National Review. The place itself is well laid out and actually thoughtful, with an indoor and outdoor seating area; a partition divides the dining area from the bar which gives a great separation. <br/><br/>W- *puts hair into a man bun* So we pulled up and there was old timey music from Mexico or something, so already you know this place is legit. The place is so cool, you can sit inside or outside. The bar has all my favorite tequilas which is rad man. We sat down and they brought out these chips and a kicking salsa that was FUEGO for sure. It was spicy brochacho, some fire salsa. I thought I was gonna burn my tongue, lol, sick man. It was YOLO for me so I asked for something even spicier! Yikes! The jah-la-peh-no one was spicy!!!<br/><br/>M- The salsa had a decent taste but was super mild. The chips were ok; they likely are store bought snd if not they are some of the best handmade chips to replicate store bought chips. I kindly asked for something spicier and the stars of the outing came on board. The habanero salsa had a wonderfully complex sweetness (minced carrots perhaps) with the heat. The jalapeño salsa was fiery but also packed a burst of sabor. The last one I believe was a mole base, definitely tamer but still a standout.<br/><br/>I came for the Puffy Taco plate but it's only available on Taco Tuesday. I went ahead and settled on the Dos Tacos plate, an adobo chicken taco and a skirt steak taco (no carnitas available). I also ordered the tacos one flour tortilla and one corn. <br/><br/>W- I ordered the two taco lunch plate and got a smokin' skirt steak taco and a chicken Adobe pdf taco (haha, that's a computer joke man). Awesome tacos, I love the onion stuff, it was crunchy like a Taco Bell crunch taco. The rice and beans were cool but the rice had some weird carrots and corn mix, never seen that before when I was in Mexico, although I mostly drank while I was in Cancun.<br/><br/>My aunt Kate who works for a big time newspaper from Califor-nie-aye said these tacos are like exact copies of the tacos in Mexico City where she lives. I wasn't about to mess these bad boys up using those ridiculously hot salsas; 3 alarm one way and out the other, you know what I mean? Hahaha<br/><br/>M- The skirt steak was well executed; it can be tough to cook but here it's flavorful; the flour tortilla fell flat and just seemed It was not enthusiastic to be here. I did like the pickled onion which added some zest but overall the tacos were lackluster.<br/><br/>The chicken adobo was juicy to the lament of the corn tortilla which started breaking apart as soon as I clenched the taco. This blessed matrimony filed for divorce as soon as I picked her up. Same toppings but this corn tortilla was just as unwilling to play along. I suspect this isn't nixtamalized and from a store nearby.<br/><br/>I always mention that tacos should be priced higher, and here they certainly do for 12 for two with rice and beans. To change folks minds though you have to deliver. Here, it's a big miss.<br/><br/>The rice and beans were standard fair, nothing to rave about but also not bad. <br/><br/>W- Everything is handmade which means it's authentic and just like my friend Armando's mom makes it. Sweet! I didn't get to try their drinks but they say they have a kickin marg man, I gotta try it! I'm definitely coming back with the homies Zach &amp; Clay, might even bring Karen, who knows. Overall an excellent experience. 4 stars man!<br/><br/>M- This is the issue when you read about things being home made... when you read about things being authentic... when you read about things borne from inspiration. What does that even mean? And more importantly, where does it come from and who is it for?<br/><br/>On their website it says: ""Join us and embrace the energy and spirit of ""Let's Go!"" or ¡Vamonos!""<br/><br/>Keeping it real and authentic would have been just naming the place for its English translation. <br/><br/>W- Hells yea, letsssss goooooooo! <br/><br/>M- Nombre, aquí no más no, vámonos ala chingada."
5,"I feel like a lot of places don't do free chips and salsa at the beginning of your meal anymore, and that's always been my favorite part of going to a Mexican restaurant. So I was thrilled to get the tasty chips and salsa at the beginning of my meal here and the really tasty and unique prickly pear marg that I thoroughly enjoyed. I honestly don't remember the food all that much, but I remember a really relaxed vibe in the outside area with fans above for when it gets hot, and also a nice indoor area as well. Service was fast and friendly as well. I remember the food being pretty good, and my husband enjoyed it as well. There are vegetarian options which sometimes gets hard at Mexican places, but lots of fresh veggies along with well seasoned beans and rice. Yum! Will be back for happy hour."
6,"Good, cheap food. Service was good Carla was very nice and answered our questions. I was not in love with the adobo chicken taco, but I really liked the cheese enchilada with the salsa rojas. The queso was good, though my brother did not enjoy the larger slices of veg in it. I didn't mind it at all. Would go back."
7,"Nothing really worked out for us, starting with the ceviche, which no one ate -- looked and tasted like it was sitting around too long and not at all fresh. The beef tacos were bland, the fish tacos were so spicy that they were inedible, doused in hot sauce. My grilled veggies were pretty good, though I would have liked larger pieces. They were finely chopped and a bit overcooked, but tasty. I also loved the house salsa! Loud music made it hard to talk."
8,"Long time customer, first time yelping it. Happy hour from 4-6 is great for appetizers. I always get Pablo's platter for the most food. My only complaint is my shrimp taco only had 3 small shrimps in it. The ceviche and guac are delicious"
9,"Delicious very authentic food, clean. service was awesome, hard working people. When in Austin will def be back"
10,"We had a LocalBuzz foodie meet up here the other day and now Vamonos is where I'm coming for my next happy hour. <br/><br/>The inside is so colorful, filled with fairy lights, plants and candles to set the mood. I actually thoroughly enjoyed the authentic Mexican music that they played, it definitely elevated the experience. <br/><br/>I went for a classic Margarita on the rocks and I will honestly say that it was one of the best I've had in a while! I loved the chips and salsa, because you could tell that it was made in house and with great care. The chicken quesadilla was pretty good, super cheesy and fulfilling. <br/><br/>I can't wait to come back and try everything else!"
11,"I hate that I didn't love my meal here. I got the puffy chicken tinga tacos because my favorite puffy chicken tinga tacos. just a few doors down from Tyson's are no longer on the menu. That's cool. They were only one of my favorite meals in Austin...<br/><br/>Anyway, to try to move on from this loss I've been on the hunt for some puffy chicken tinga tacos, and I saw than Vamanos has them on Tuesdays. I was so excited: great reviews for the restaurant and still close by. I tried them two days ago. Quite disappointing. The tinga had little flavor and tasted almost old. The puffy tacos were also lackluster themselves. I would give two stars, but maybe the seven minute drive to my place did the puffy tacos in. Although, it was never an issue with Tyson's...<br/><br/>Maybe it's just this dish, but I doubt I'll head back anytime soon."
12,Great margaritas and the best queso in town. What more do you need? Vamonos now................
13,"Great spot to check out for some Tex-mex and margaritas!<br/><br/>The nachos turned out amazing, each chip equally as loaded as the others, ample amount of bean &amp; cheese on each! The quesadillas were also a good pick, simple but predictably good!<br/><br/>Started with a regular frozen margarita and went for a frozen prickly pear for Rd 2. Both are great, would definitely recommend the frozen over the rocks margarita. Super refreshing on both and great for the upcoming summer days."
14,"I don't know Vamonos why never caught my attention before. Maybe I thought it was just another taco stand. It came up when I was trying to find tex-mex restaurants with patios, to take advantage of the spring weather that's finally here. We ordered some tacos and enchiladas, tortilla soup, salad, and corn. The beef on the tacos was outstanding! Chicken tortilla soup was generous on the toppings. Sauces and salsa were mild, which I appreciate. Everything else was average. The corn wasn't worth getting again. All-in-all, I've got another place to add to my list of favorites."
15,"I'm obsessed with their school style taco salad. It's everything with crunch and freshness from the lettuce and tomatoes, salty umami from the ground beef, tang from the salsa, sweetness from the corn, earthiness from the radishes, and a touch of creaminess. Pair it with a prickly pear margarita and it hit all the notes on a sunny afternoon."
16,"I went to Vamonos with a big group on a weekday during lunch. They have two decent sized parking lots on either side.<br/><br/>The free chips and salsa was a great starter and decently spicy as well. The wait times in between ordering and getting the food was quite long (we spend 1.5 hours there). I got the veggie enchilada with salsa verde. The portion sizes were huge and very filling, though the veggies were a bit bland."
17,Beautiful food in a beautiful space. Family friendly. Great drinks and food. Ambiance is 100% perfect South Texas so great place to take anybody visiting from out of town.
18,"I would give this place a 2.5 if that was an option. The food is ok, the frozen margarita was good, the service was ok, however, see picture for an idea of portions- I ordered the Tacos Al Pastor and got three tacos with one small spoonful of the meat on each, with a side of rice and beans, and I paid $14 for that. The tacos were pretty standard, nothing special. And the day I went, the chips seemed maybe a bit stale, something was off. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place, except maybe to get one margarita during happy hour, but outside of happy hour, they are $10 for a fairly small cup, so again, not the best value. For similar price but better portion sizes and food taste, try El Chile on Manor."
19,"RIPOFF ALERT!!!<br/><br/>What a surprise delivered to us at the end of the meal (after waiting over 15 minutes to get the check after I asked for it).  In addition to a bogus 1.5% ""Wellness Fee"", they'd tacked on a 20% MANDATORY tip, AFTER tax (I don't recall the tax man providing any service) and ""Welllness Fee"".  My wife and I were there with my son, his wife and their two small children.  It wasn't even a big party of people.  NOWHERE in the restaurant-not on the menu, not on any signs, NOWHERE was their anything to alert us to this ""policy"".<br/><br/>Anyway, the food was average and overpriced.  The waitress was nice but spilled a glass of water all over our table and then disappeared for 15 minutes after I asked for the check.<br/><br/>There are SO MANY better options for Tex-Mex than this place.  We won't be back and advise other Yelpers to watch out for the Vamonos RIP-OFF.<br/><br/>To them I say, Adios!"
20,really below average Mexican food. Enchiladas were probably the worst enchiladas I've ever had. Fajitas were average. Waiting staff was really sweet but food was just too bad. Wont go back again.
21,It's pretty dang good and consistent. <br/>Outside patio is amazing and fun for a cute little casual date night<br/>Salsa is amazing and recommend the chicken enchiladas with creama problano sauce (spelling obviously incorrect lol)
22,Vamonos is one of my go to place for Tex-Mex. They have both covered patio seating and indoor seating with plenty of options for different party sizes. The blue and pink theme is super cute and definitely adds to the ambience. The complimentary chips and salsa is one of the best I've ever had. The salsa is smoky and rich without the normal acidity from other tomato salsas. I usually order the Pablito's platter. It's definitely enough food to fill me up especially with the family style beans and rice that comes with it. The only reason why I'm docking a star is because in my experience service is a little slow.
23,"This restaurant reminds me of one you would find in Mexico, the decor, service, food-cutlery and even the coffee mugs. We LOVED the food!!!! What I appreciate most about this place is the small details like the paper bag with a stamp of Vamanos on the chip bags and the bill holder complete with a slot for your credit card. We had multiple Salsa, extra  chips, queso, elotes, enchiladas- everything we ate was on point!!"
24,"The puffy tacos are like mana from Heaven. On Taco  Tuesday's you get your choice of chicken or picadillo filled tacos plus rice and beans. The picadillo tacos are incredible. It starts with the homemade puffy corn tortilla and then just builds from there with perfectly spiced beef, fresh lettuce, tomatoes and shaved jack cheese. Awesome flavors. <br/><br/>The ranch queso is also a must. One of the best quesos I ever tasted. <br/><br/>Service was prompt and friendly!"
25,"Great spot that flies under the radar. It was a perfect spot with friends on a Friday night. Casual atmosphere but still lots of fun without being a big restaurant. The enchiladas and steak tacos are fantastic, guacamole is delish as is the queso. Great virgin margs for those that Donny drink and regular margaritas for those that do. Kind staff. We loved it!"
26,Margaritas and food were delicious! Service was friendly and fast and serving sizes were large. Would recommend and we'll be back!
27,"Taco Tuesday, need I say more.  <br/>But, Puffy taco Tuesday makes it the best Taco Tuesday in town!<br/><br/>These puffy tacos remind me of San Antonio style Mexican food.  And these tacos were filled to the brim with Piccadillo.  <br/><br/>My husband had the grilled fish fillet.  It had a good Oak smoke.  It was really-really good!   In fact, I gave him a puffy taco in exchange for some of his fish, like a buffet! <br/><br/>Dogs are allowed on the patio, the reason why we dined here."
28,This is by far one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to lately. Their queso blanco is rich and buttery! The salsa is amazing. I ordered the enchiladas with pablano crema sauce and I am hooked!
29,"While in desperate search for some white queso in Austin, we came upon Vamonos. And glad we did!<br/><br/>We arrived on a Friday night &amp; were seated immediately on the patio. Our first stop was the queso, of course. It was a $10 queso, but it lasted the 2 of us through 2 chip bags (intermittent with their special somewhat smoky salsa, which was delightful).<br/><br/>One note, our waitress was the STAR of the show - she was SO nice to us, recommended her favorite menu item (which was AMAZING), and even gave us some tips for our next visit.<br/><br/>The food:<br/>Pros: Chicken enchiladas with poblano sauce - the BEST. White queso was actually white queso (which is what we've been trying to find), salsa was different and great<br/><br/>Cons: soda refills are not free (but our waitress very politely let us know before we ordered more), the beans a little soupy, the queso was a little overwhelmed with peppers/pepper flavor"
30,"We love the food, cocktail's, employees very kind, nice music and environment.... And the best of us the opportunity to be in a nice patio having the company of our dogs. Very well recommended Vamonos!!"
31,"Its nice to walk into a joint and know whats coming. Service is always above and beyond. Food is always fresh and hot. We both have our set dishes these days. Wife with Beef Chiladas, double Rice....Mine is the Pablitos Plate with Chicken Chilada with Poblano Sauce and a Red Fish Taco...and in my opinion....Best in Town. I switch up between Charro and Refried....both are excellent. Rice is always good. And this round I added the Elotes which was outstanding. I always recommend Vamonos when people ask where to get great Tex-mex food. The consistency of the food and the service is what keeps us coming back."
32,"I stopped by Vamono's because I saw the good reviews on Yelp. The food was okay, but the portions are very small and the price is high. I also saw on my ticket that we were charged a ""wellness fee.""<br/>I'm not sure how this place has 4 1/2 stars on Yelp."
33,Wow! It didn't get much better than this. We were looking for somewhere we haven't tried and also kind of fast for lunch. Vamonos was amazing! I had the taco enchilada combination with verde. My wife had the cheese enchiladas with rojo. Also you have to get the queso with all the toppings. One of the best white quesos we have ever had.  We are totally coming back with our kids.  Highly recommend!
34,"From the restaurant group that brought you Backspace, Olive &amp; June, and Parkside brings you a tex-mex concept with ¡Vamonos! that takes inspiration from ranches across Texas where vaqueros and cowboys sat down together, sharing a table and a hot meal off a wood burning grill to bring you simple food done well. I got:<br/><br/>- The Skirt Steak: great flavor of the steak. It comes from 44 Farms, so you know it's high quality. They also grill the steak over oak and wow! I love that. The wood flavor with the rich chewy meat made for a fun dish to have and my favorite dish here!<br/><br/>- Chicken Enchiladas: this comes filled with shredded chicken and topped with Oaxaca and jack cheese, poblano cream, and green salsa. A classic tex-mex dish, can't go wrong here.<br/><br/>- Nachos Ignacio: they house-make their own crispy tortilla bases, top them off with beans, Oaxaca and jack cheese, pickled jalapeño, and picadillo (beef). These were a fun snack to munch on before the meals came out.<br/><br/>- Ranch Style Queso Blanco: white American cheese, poblano peppers, piccadilly beef, guacamole all come together to bring you a light, yet flavorful queso that'll have you wanting more.<br/><br/>- Elotes: Mexican street corn with chili power, mayo, lime, queso fresco, cream - this is a classic must-have. Great creamy flavor.<br/><br/>- Agua Fresca: my favorite drink. It's simple: water, lime, sugar. Great, refreshing way to compliment the meal.<br/><br/>All in all, I had a great time here. Inside there's vibrant, bright decor and they have an outdoor shaded patio. They play classic cumbia music that reminds me of childhood when my mom always played this music on the radio. I give them an 4/5 for being great."
35,"We tried this place out, and it was fantastic! I love the atmosphere and the enchiladas were fantastic. My gf had a margarita on the rocks and she was impressed with the drinks as well. We will definitely come back again soon."
36,"I have to say, for suck a small place their food is outstanding! I had the ranch tacos and they were the bomb! I can't wait to go back and try the others! Just be patient if their busy, it's worth the wait!"
37,Great place! I went for happy hour with my sister and boyfriend and enjoyed the frozen margaritas. Our server even brought us tasters of the seasonal drink they had (a guava frozen margarita). The salsa selection was very impressive and spanned the range of super spicy green salsa to smoky chipotle salsa. I enjoyed the skirt steak and had plenty of food -- I took some home!
38,"I don't know what took me so long to try all the delish bites at Vamonos but better late than never right? <br/><br/>We had the chicken enchiladas, fish tacos and the prickly pear margaritas and I'd highly recommend any and all of those! The poblano cream sauce on the enchiladas is to die for and I'd bathe in it if I could. <br/><br/>The prickly pear margaritas are frozen and a must. Like order one tonight! I don't care if it's cold outside lol. They're craveable and one of the best frozen margaritas I've had!"
39,The worse Mexican food I've ever had in  my life. Horrible service. Many dirty tables.  It was disgusting felt like i just got robbed of my $60.00 want a refund. I was a professional chef for 15 years this place was short staffed or no one cares. All Sysco ingredients just terrible. Who serves corn tortillas for tacos right out of the package cold? Absolutely terrible.
40,"I have no idea what's going on with this place. The menu is priced pretty high, which wouldn't be an issue if I had any inkling that I should eat here.<br/><br/>The chips are stale, the salsa that they bring out is odd, I dare say awful.  They ask if you'd like the ""spicy"" salsas, which I obviously did.  When they brought them out, the three ""spicy"" salsas are not. The ""habanero"" salsa is basically frozen, and has no significant spice at all.  The tomatillo salsa is plain, but the best offering.  The third salsa, morita, is also very bland, not smoky or spicy.<br/><br/>I'll save myself the $15 before finding out the enchiladas, etc suck. <a href=""mailto:onebadwagon@gmail.com"">onebadwagon@gmail.com</a>"
41,"We enjoyed our food, the atmosphere, and the service here. Get the elotes if you like corn, this was our favorite!"
42,"Love this place- everything we've had on multiple trips has been amazing, and service is generally good!  Food and drinks are delicious and reasonably priced!"
43,"Absolutely amazing!! The service is amazing, Serena the manager was absolutely wonderful. The waitress was incredible. Everyone was so kind and attentive.<br/><br/>Now, THE FOOD??? First, I am hispanic. I am also from Dallas- born and raised. Mexican food is quite literally me. It's my first mexican restaurant since living out here in austin (been suspicious) and let me tell you- the FOOD?????? Was absolutely incredible. Every bite felt like my first bite. I had a prickly pear &amp; Mexican Margaritas- both splendid. Their Queso??? Thick and beautiful in every possible way."
44,"I really loved their customer service my waiter was super polite and awesome I had two actually and I loved their queso and their charro beans. We ordered the Don Pedro, Pelon burrito, and the Pablo plate. They were good. Also u need to try the pepino con chile drink"
45,Very average. Only 2 people were serving. Did not really speak English! Guacamole was bland and average. Margaritas were horrible. Too much line and could not taste tequila. Enchiladas were also cold inside. Very sad place and hate to say that Papasitos walks all over this place.
46,"Perhaps I should have given Vamonos! Four stars instead of three as there are lots of positives here, but I'm disappointed at the moment.  <br/>My friends and I go to lunch every Tuesday and sometimes we like to try new places. This week we decided Vamonos!<br/>The restaurant is an unassuming building at 4807 Airport Boulevard. There was plenty of parking (a real plus in Austin) and the door to the building opens into a spacious patio area that's really comfortable at this time of year.<br/>Once we were all gathered, the waitress brought chips in paper bags (easy to recycle- the chips weren't greasy!) and  three types of hot sauce, one for every palette. The hottest sauce it's chopped jalapeño with just the right amount of burn.<br/>Three of ordered tea, which tasted freshly made, plus for an Austin restaurant. When we ordered food, we each got something different,  and each of us was pleased with our lunch- we shared a little bit around the table.<br/>However, when the bill came we had been charged for dinner prices instead of lunch prices. I searched on the web for the menu and the enchiladas we got should have been $11 (lunch price) but we were charged $13 (dinner price).  I looked at the house menu and found the same prices posted.I showed this to the waitress and she went away for a while and then came back and said that the kitchen staff had fixed the plates with three enchiladas instead of two enchiladas, which is the difference between the lunch and dinner platters. She did not offer to change the price. <br/>I understand that patrons have some responsibility when ordering, but it seems traditional when patrons are ordering at lunch time  for the person taking the order to verify whether patrons are asking for the lunch or dinner option. All of us were disappointed in this miscommunication .<br/>The positives of this restaurant are location! Location! Location! and the staff and owner are very cordial. The space is bright and clean, even in the bathrooms, a definite plus.<br/>This would have been an excellent experience if it hadn't been for the miscommunication and overcharge on our meals. <br/>I don't know that we will go back for lunch, and if we do we will Make sure before the order gets to the kitchen that the wait staff has our taken our order correctly."
47,Just waited 45 minutes - no one cleared our table or brought a bag of chips <br/><br/>Not trying to be a jerk and I know they were understaffed tonite - but in between dropping off checks and picking up slips  they coulda put some chips on the table to keep us happy <br/><br/>Seems odd to schedule an event like spirit night and not be prepared ...but any number of things could have resulted in this situation. So I will definitely be back BUT my suggestion is to develop a plan that stops paying customers from walking away and leaving one star reviews ;)
48,"Great food, drinks, and a fun atmosphere. Also a very nice patio outside. Best queso in Austin."
49,"The staff was very nice but the food was just so so. The elote was different from every other one I've ever had but not in a good way. I got the chicken, fish and shrimp tacos and wasn't exactly impressed by any of them. I'd try somewhere new before going back here but wouldn't be opposed to trying something different from their menu."
50,"I'm a San Antonian who moved to Austin some years ago and am still looking for San Antonio style Mexican food in Austin. My daughter and I decided to try this place. It was a very pleasant environment, we sat on the patio to enjoy the cool weather outside. Our server was also very pleasant. She was prompt to bring chips and salsa, menus, and get out drink order. It was once we tasted the food and drinks that it was easily disappointing. The salsa looked good and had a little pepper to it but way under salted. Very bland. The drinks came and they were equally disappointing. If there was any alcohol in the margaritas, it didn't make it into either glass (and we had different flavored margaritas.)<br/>I had the chicken enchiladas with the verde sauce and they were pretty tasty. The refried beans and rice were served separately, for the table, and while also a little bland, were still good. Unfortunately, the underwhelming salsa and drinks had already left their mark.<br/>If you're looking for something new, it's worth stopping in, just don't expect it to be more than it is."
51,"Small portions, big prices. It was definitely not the best texmex I've had in town. But it was conveniently located at the time we were hungry."
52,Was in the neighborhood and had no idea where to eat. We chose Vamonos by chance. I had the Ranch Taco with Carnitas and my friend had the Tacos el pastor. Our food was a amazing and the restaurant was very cute. I have already told three friends that they have to visit and try their tacos.
53,"This place is really good! I'm super impressed with the redfish! I had a redfish taco and shrimp enchilada (the pabloito plate) was delicious. The margaritas are strong and tasty. It was my friends birthday and they took care of her drink and gave us a free dessert, which was a giant sopapillo! So good!  Remy,our server, was working hard, busy, but still tended to us in a timely manner."
54,"Solid Tex-Mex place, the enchiladas are really good, pastor is also good and they have horchata. Won't blow your socks off but is a nice enough place, well located and with parking, so is worth a shot if you have a craving. Portions are not small but definitely not Texas sized."
55,"Wow, was i surprised at how awesome the food and service is at Vamonos.  One saturday afternoon my wife and I decided to have an early dinner and we wanted to try a new place we hadn't been to so of course we opened our trusty Yelp app and Vamonos was our pick.  <br/>Upon arrival we were happily greeted and seated by Pena who was also our waiter.  They have inside and outside seating on a little patio, not to big but not to small either. <br/>Pena let us know that they just started happy hour and they do happy hour every day from 4-6pm.  We decided to step out of our norm and try a couple cocktails Pena recommended, the Prickly Pear Margarita and the El Camino. My wife absolutely loved the prickly pear marg!  The El Camino was good as well, the flavors of the mezcal and Benedictine came together and make a really nice cocktail.<br/>Everything on the menu sounded so good so we relied on Pena once again for recommendations. We wanted to try a little bit of everything so Pena recommended we ordered the Ven Pescar plate and Pablo's Plato.  Pablo's Plato come with 2 enchiladas and 2 taco, so we got 1 chicken enchilada and 1 beef,  and 1 steak taco and 1 carnitas taco.  The Ven Pescar comes with 3 tacos with grilled redfish or shrimp.  This way we could try several different tacos and a couple of the enchiladas.  Wow the food and flavors were awesome.  <br/>Pena told us one of the things that makes their food a little different is their meats are cooked on a wood burning grill. If you are familiar with grilling then you know charcoal, wood, and gas all give meat a different flavor and i prefer the wood grilling.<br/>Pro tip1 -  If you like salsa be sure to ask them for their salsas, they have 4 different kinds and they are all really good. <br/>Pro tip2 - If you like tequilas they have an awesome selection, i highly recommend trying something new.<br/>All in all Vamonos was a homerun for us.  We enjoyed the food, drinks, atmosphere, and service.  When you come i would recommend my man Pena he was awesome.  He took the time to really go the extra mile and tell us about the drinks and how flavors are paired with the food, and how they were made, etc..."
56,"Love this place it still has that true Austin vibe! Food was so good, fresh, and flavorful. The margarita was insanely wonderful! The service was also lovely. We sat on the patio and was pleasantly surprised how laid back and comfortable it was. All of the staff were extremely friendly and kind. We will definitely be back, the patio alone sold me! Really good vibes!"
57,Drove all the way from Round Rock because of the good reviews *and* hours and it's closed.  Super tired of businesses not taking the time to update their hours on search platforms.
58,"Omg! The food was delicious  I thought it was going to be really tex mex, but it still has that authentic Mexican flavor, and the drinks were bomb. Plus, they have a really good playlist. I want to get up and dance. They should have a dance floor, lol."
59,Pretty pricey and smaller quantities than what we are used to. They advertise their free chips and salsa and I guess that's important considering they serve small family-style beans and rice. I was hoping for a low carb choice and ordered the Caesar salad. The rest of the group ordered enchiladas. My husband is an enchilada expert and says theirs are 4.5 out of 5. The rice and beans were so so.
60,"This place is amazing!!! I honestly don't know why it isn't more busy, the environment is so trendy and cute and the food is delicious!! The employees were extremely friendly and we got our food quickly. I definitely recommend the ranch queso, it was to die for!!!"
61,"This is such a cool vibe of a place. It has outdoor, covered seating and indoor dining. It feels like walking into a café with attentive staff and a very cultural ambiance - bright colors, upbeat music and greetings of all smiles. The food presentation is beautiful. Unfortunately, that's where the positives pause. The food is overly seasoned and it's difficult to taste all that is going on. There's an imbalance of flavors that just leave some flavors (chili powder) overpowering all of the others. The slaw mix inside tastes somewhat spoiled, though it appeared fresh. The seasoning just didn't  work for my palate. I was quite hopeful for this spot and left disappointed. Everyone was super friendly - even brought the food out to our car so we didn't have to wait inside. They get two stars for the warm and friendly service. I wish the taste of the food matched. It fell way short for me."
62,"Great spot! Delicious enchiladas for lunch this afternoon, and it's a decent spot for rambunctious kids (my guy is 4). It was cold today but there is a good sized screened patio so seems like an excellent place on a nice day too! Will definitely be coming back."
63,I love Vamonos!! The food is so yummy. Especially the enchiladas with the poblano cream sauce. The ranch water was delicious. The staff is so helpful and friendly. I highly recommend!
64,"Vamanos is fantastic! We love the food, drinks, and overall vibes!! Every employee is kind and does a great job. We've only had one issue when we ordered Nachos but 20 minutes or so later were asked if we wanted to order anything... the server hadn't ""heard"" us, but it was getting busy so she likely forgot. We didn't care because we weren't in a rush so it wasn't an issue. <br/><br/>They social distance fantastically, the restrooms are always clean, and the music is always on point! If you haven't stopped by for happy hour -- you should! We drive all the way from Pflugerville because we love it every time!  Highly recommend the Prickly Pear Margarita with a Pineapple Floater. So yum!"
65,"Vamanos always performs! Food is fresh, creative and tasty. Starting off with chips and salsa that was well seasoned! Portions are nice but not large. Presentation superb and tasty!"
66,"The food was decent but not as amazing as the reviews suggest. The chips were lacking and somewhat stale. Salsa was enjoyable  but not spicy at all- mostly tasted like tomatoes. The queso was good, but nothing special. I ordered the Don Pedro to share with my partner. The sautéed veggies were on point along with the Chile toreado. The steak was salty but in my opinion not flavorful and a tad bit overcooked. I was expecting a lot better but left thinking it was overhyped and mediocre at best. We went on a Sunday evening when it was crazy busy, but our server did a great job despite the chaos."
67,I'm upset that I just found out about this place. The atmosphere when you walk in is so inviting. I sat inside but when the weather is nice the patio looks amazing.
68,"We had the skirt steak, elotes, queso, and enchiladas and everything was perfection! Frozen margaritas were the perfect consistency and flavor - and just sweet enough. The manager even went out of their way to give us margarita taste testers and a free queso coupon for next time because of a rowdy/slightly belligerent table next to us. Can't wait to come back! This place is a gem."
69,"Awesome place! Food was yummy! We had the taco salad and chilaquiles. The salsa is amazing! It was very fresh with lots of veggies, had a kick but that didn't linger. I enjoyed it so much I ordered extra and added it all over my salad :) Super friendly and attentive staff. Our server was named Laura and she was so nice. She let us rattle off all of our special instructions for our orders (we are dairy and gluten free so we may come off as a pain in the butt to some). She just smiled and assured us it was all good. Food came out perfect and delicious! Sorry we didn't take pictures but it was too good to wait!!!<br/><br/>We're moving soon and considering this neighborhood. If we do land here, we'll for sure be back!"
70,"Amaaazing. Surpassed our expectations by far. We got the chicken enchiladas, esquites (corn), beef enchiladas, guac and chips. It was all fantastic. The rice and beans were so good we have taken note to order extra next time. Because oh boy there will definitely be next times. <br/><br/>Loved their online ordering system and their curbside pickup experience - super easy to use and no surprises. We got a ton of food and honestly we planned on leftovers but ended up devouring basically everything we ordered. <br/><br/>I will say that the food was not very spicy and we like spicy. So next time we order we will ask if there are any spicy salsas or sauces available. And the chips were so fresh and amazing when we got them but they became stale overnight in a sealed bag so you have no reason to  leave leftovers!"
71,"Amazing! Good service, great food, awesome atmosphere! Absolutely recommend and will be coming back."
72,Their food is fire. One of the best Tex mex places in Austin. Amazing white cheese queso and the Pablo's plate is my personal go-to dish with the redfish tacos and beef enchiladas you cannot go wrong. The staff is always nice and helpful too. Glad this place has been under the radar and I hope it stays low key.
73,"I'm tired of this place being empty when it should be packed out because it is SO GOOD! I live down the street and come here often. The drinks are great, the food is delicious and not overpriced, and the ambience is great."
74,"I've never been a fan on Tex-Mex especially since I'm from the valley, Mexican food usually isn't on top of my list of food choices when I go out to eat. Vamonos definitely changed my perspective on that after I visited them. Truly impressed. <br/><br/>For starters, FREE CHIPS!<br/><br/>As soon as you sit down, you're greeted by your waiter/waitress and BOOM! Chips and salsa at your table! No long wait and you don't even have to ask.<br/><br/>The environment is nice and mellow. The lighting is a bit dim and I felt that made the environment more comfortable to be in. <br/><br/>The food was fantastic! The puffy tacos and chicken enchiladas were sooooooo delicious! <br/><br/>I could say so much more but simply put this place is a 5/5 star Tex-Mex joint. Check it out and find out for yourself!"
75,"It was my boyfriends and I first time coming here and it was WONDERFUL!!! The place is clean and restrooms are clean as well. Our servers, Peña and Arianna were attentive, friendly and professional! We were happy with our decision coming here. I recommend the Pablo's Plato and Ranchos Tacos. As for the drinks, the Pickly Pear and Paloma frozen drinks were on point. <br/><br/>Al &amp; Sue"
76,By far one of the best food choices I've made since moving to Austin 2 months ago. Ruben's customer service was top tier. He brought us a bowl of their custom Tex-Mex queso when he found it was our first time here. He brought an array of salsas that were all tasty when I asked for salsa for me taco.<br/><br/>The chips were hot and fresh when set on our table. And delicious table salsa.<br/><br/>The pastor taco I had was americanzed but v delicious! I will bring more friends back here. Prices were very fair! Even enjoyed their bill presentation! 10/10
77,Awesome brunch at Vamonos yesterday. We wanted to go somewhere with a patio but it was chilly and windy -- luckily this place has a nice wraparound enclosed patio with heaters! Chips and salsa come out first and fast. I had the elotes (legit!) And tortilla soup (thick and hearty). There's a salsa sampler and the queso is delicious. Fantastic service - we'll be back!
78,"Great patio...covered...misters...everything Austin requires.  The Watermelon-pepper Maragaritas were fantastic and the service prompt and very friendly.  The food, however, really seals the deal.  This is a hidden gem in Austin.  The carnitas tacos and folded enchiladas--wow!  Seriously, I regret finding this place so late in my trials to find great unknowns...why did I wait over a year from identifying a place to go to eating there?  Fabulous food and atmosphere to hang out at and we'll be back in numbers for sure!"
79,"I had driven past Vamonos many times but just never put it together to actually stop in! I saw an Instagram post or ad with pics and I told my husband, WE'RE GOING TONIGHT. <br/>We have been 3 times in the past month now...No matter how busy they are, we always get really wonderful and friendly service. They have plenty of seating indoor and outdoor(If you're more flexible with indoor, I'm sure that attributes to us getting a table so quickly these days). <br/>Their chips and salsa are a great start to the meal and my personal fav so far has been the puffy tacos on Taco Tuesday. I haven't been drinking but I get their refreshing agua fresca's and my husband has been enjoying their margaritas. There is a pink margarita that I am dying to try because it looks so delicious every time I see it being delivered to a table..So I am excited I will be trying that(and their other drinks) in a month when I can drink again!! :)<br/>Support this awesome local business!! I wish I had tried them out before since we've been looking for our new chill, tex-mex restaurant for a while!"
80,Super cute restaurant with awesome appetizers and drinks! Very Austin-Mex. The prickly pear and guayaba margaritas were oh so yummy. Paired nicely with the ranch chile con queso and street corn. Would definitely bring out-of-town guests here.
81,"In the sea of Tex-Mex that is Austin, TX, it can be hard to differentiate meals you have.<br/><br/>Since I'm apparently into lists right now, here are some of the things that make Vamanos stand out: <br/><br/>1. Cute interior. Really clean and trendy, feels really open, love what they've done with it. Lots of sunshine!<br/><br/>2. High quality meat<br/><br/>3. Good service <br/><br/>4. A lot of fish options, for my pescatarian bros<br/><br/>5. Lots of flavor, definitely love the poblano crema <br/><br/>6. Location - central, lots of parking! <br/><br/>Splitting the Pablos plato with a friend is perfect, reasonably priced, and leaves some money for drinks. Or, more likely in my case, additional queso."
82,"Yo this place is amazing!  1) Great staff (Reuben, Jucy &amp; Peña) that provides awesome service, which is hard to find nowadays.  2) Good food (best beef nachos in the state).  3) Nice Happy Hour specials.  4) And most importantly, Excellent TEQUILA selections!!"
83,"Salsa is truly delicious, as other reviewers mentioned. But. Can't say the same about any other food we had. Beef fajitas tacos were chewy in a bad way and just bland, even though meat had some nice smoky flavor. Chicken enchiladas were just OK, but nothing special or to come back for. <br/>Not sure why this place has such great reviews. It's just not good and not bad. It's OK."
84,"I live in the northeast, and came to TX for a conference. I wanted 2 things when I was here - good BBQ and good Mexican. I searched Mexican places online, and found this had good reviews. My hotel was about 20 min from here, and I expected it to be more downtown when I got here, but the location is probably what made it better, and less touristy. Right away I was impressed by how fresh the margarita tasted. I wanted to try a flavored one, too, but the house was just so good that I went for a 2nd. I ordered a taco and enchilada combo, and street corn. The food was nothing compared to even the best tex mex food I've had up north. I tried to describe it to coworkers the next day, and just couldn't find the words. And the best part the the friendly staff! Everyone was so attentive, and the owner was always present and helping his staff where he could. I would absolutely come back here in a heartbeat when I come back into town (it was better than the BBQ I got the next night), and I would recommend this place to anyone in the area!"
85,"I added a review of our Vamonos experience and tasty food in this video. Hope it helps, scroll to a little after 3 minute mark - <a href=""/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2Fd7nt43iwfUY&amp;s=17c8815d2a166100c75c52587e64d1309a9be712cb1d0db536ba9ca6f81b8194"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">youtu.be/d7nt43iwfUY</a>"
86,"This new TexMex joint is bright and airy, with a nice patio and a short and fairly simple menu. The service was friendly and the few glitches were about what you'd expect in a brand new place. I also like the whole idea of ingredients ""locally sourced when possible."" <br/><br/>My Margarita was good, as was my pork carnitas taco lunch special, and the Queso Blanco. But the question left unresolved for my lunch companion and me is whether it was all good enough to stand out in an area as saturated in good TexMex as Austin. The $10 lunch specials seemed a bit pricey, especially when presented as tiny little entree plates, with little shared bowls of unremarkable refried beans and rice. I was annoyed that I couldn't try two kinds of tacos on my 2 Taco lunch special, although the carnitas I decided on were really good.<br/><br/>When I asked my friend for her opinion, she said what I was thinking--that there were several places nearby with very good good, more options, and a better price. She is a very light eater, but commented on the ""presentation,"" that it's disappointing to get the little plate enchilada and shared rice and beans opposed to the platter you get at other places."
87,"If we could give it 10 stars, we would! Every staff member was friendly and helpful with great recommendations. The margs were fantastic. Highly recommend the chips, salsa, guacamole, and chicken enchiladas- OH YUM!"
88,Everything tasted good. I don't know how much I'd care to come back again but I don't regret the stop to try this place.
89,Great find. Good food start to finish! Make sure to order a Margarita with Queso and Guacamole! More chips please!
90,"Excellent Tex mex. we came in on a Tuesday which happens to be puffy taco night. These are easy to eat and really tasty! My friend had a beef and shrimp fajita thing, which was great, we coupled this with some Guacamole and prickly pear margs! <br/>Good stuff"
91,"Food was great! Free chips and salsa? Sign me up! I got the enchiladas and it was delicious! The horchata here was also super tasty, one of the better ones I've had. Great service as well!"
92,First Mexican place I tried while visiting Austin.  So damn good we came back the next day for round 2.  That should say it all.
93,Amazing little hidden gem! The food is to die for #carnitas and the drinks are delicious as well. Fun music. Prompt service. Colorful!
94,"Husband and I stopped by for late lunch. Chris took great care of us.  Food was delicious.  The salsas were flavorful abc just the right amount of heat.  We had the Queso and it was creamy with poblano and just the right amount of meat. The chips were crispy and light.  Husband ordered 3 tacos.  Pork and steak and chicken. The meat was perfectly cooked, and great quality.  I had a steak taco and enchilada. Loved it! We had their rice and beans too.  I think if a restaurant has poor rice and beans the rest can't be good.  Well, the rice was delicious and fluffy. Beans were also very fresh and delicious.   My prickly pear margarita was amazing!! So glad I found Vamonos."
95,Literally stumbled upon this place last minute. I'm glad I did. The place is a gem for sure. Good and drinks are amazing. Ordered the don pedro skillet and it was more than enough. Their mixed drinks are really good and have their unique flavor. Will definitely make this a regular spot.
96,"As a former Texan now living in California, this was the exact Tex Mex I've been craving! Well done Vamonos! From the sauces to the dishes, it was great!<br/><br/>Thanks for letting me ""come home"" for a bit."
97,"Wonderful environment, great food, great service and definitely will come back !!!!!!"
98,Great service... loved the house salsa! Tortilla soup has awesome flavor and they are generous with avocado and cheese. Soup orders are cups... order two if you want a meal.
99,"Vamonos is a GEM!  You will WANT to dine here! <br/><br/>I stepped into Vamonos for the first time on a hopping Saturday night last week and I was not disappointed.  The wait staff were able to seat me and my friend in no time!  <br/><br/>After being seated it was win after win!  <br/>First up were the chips and salsa.  Delicious.  Pro-Tip: order the extra salsas.  There is this sweet yet very spicy habanero salsa that tastes like heaven.  <br/><br/>Next we ordered the queso, and it was equally delish! ProMax-Tip: put that delicious habanero salsa in it and you'll experience Dune.  The spice must flow! <br/><br/>Our tasty margaritas arrived up next and I was thrilled.  Their margaritas were great!  For those addicted to the margs like me, they're not too tart and it tasted like Vamonos didn't use a mix.  It's all natural, baby!  Bonus: you can chose the cheap or bougie tequila you want the drink made with. Aw yeah! <br/><br/>Lastly, we ordered the fajitas for two.  Y'all this meal was so large!  It was equally tasty and satisfying.  But the best thing, the steak was perfectly medium!  THEY DIDN'T SCORCH THE STEAK! I've been to a few places here in Austin and the fajita steak was burnt.  No bueno.  We had plenty of meat to make 5 tacos and then we had enough food left that we took home a large amount for next day left-overs.   <br/><br/>If you can't tell by now, don't wait, but go to Vamonos for a wonderful delicious dinner!"
100,"Great service, good food. <br/>Ariana was amazing. Something needed to be adjusted on my order and she was very helpful and prompt. <br/>Will definitely visit / order from here again!"
101,"Daaaaammnn son. We just ordered curbside from here for the first time, and let me just tell you, FIRE! Like FIRE <br/>Best Tex Mex Sunday Brunch I've had in a while. We FEASTED TODAY. The ""all day"" Chilaquiles had the most delicious tangy green salsa and the eggs were cooked perfectly. The nachos, the enchiladas, the salsas; everything was perfect and piping hot. We even ordered Togo prickly pear margaritas and modelos to get the party started back at home  ....ayyyeee we livin the good life during the quarantine. Thank you so much Vamonos staff! We will most definitely be back."
102,"I saw alot of great reviews on facebook about this place and wanted to try it. I have been eating and making mexican food  for over 18 years.  Me and my son went there. When you walk in to the left is a poster of a cat and unicorn with lasers coming  out of eyes and the caulk board has boobs on it. I was thinking that's out of place but  the food has to be good I was thinking. We look the menu (which has alot of miss spellings)<br/> the there is not a variety just chicken and beef. When we ask the cashier the difference between 2 tacos. All the lady said was 1 hard one soft. Still I was think food has to be better than service or maybe shes just having a bad day.  I spent over 20 dollars on 2 meals if the food is good then its worth it, I was wrong. I asked the lady if i  could have taco sauce. She stated it was in the box. What was in the box was  tiny cups of salsa. The beef taco had just cheese and lettuce without any flavor. I was disappointed. The burrtio i took one bite out of and stopped it also had poor quality to it it appear as if a child make it. The cheese sauce you can tell it came from a can. You tell most of is bought from a store with no effort or prep put in it. There is no auethic mexican food here in any way. They only  open packages and serve. And last thing they dont follow covid guidelines they only wear mask when taking your order. When they so to food prep area they come off. The tables were not six feet apart. I'm so disappointed in this place."
103,"The outside of the building says Free Chips and they are good.  The chips were light, but sturdy enough to hold a scoop of salsa. Now the salsa was flavorful, but didn't have any heat at all.<br/>The Nachos Ignagios were very good. The beef was excellent and the cheese was melted perfectly.  The presentation was, well, pretty. The nachos were not overloaded with ingredients like other restaurants. <br/>The sopapilla was as big as my head and that's big.  It was dusted with Mexican cinnamon and agave. <br/>I'll be back."
104,"This place used to be good. Today we were overcharged, our food was cold, cheese was hard and un melted. My date and I went to lunch, ordered the lunch specials and were charged for the dinner plates, we were also overcharged on our nachos. I'll provide pictures of the receipts, I kept the initial one &amp; the last one. This happened twice, on the third time the prices were changed to what they should be. We were given one type of watery salsa, usually they give 2 or 3 salsa's. When my date asked about the other salsa's our waitress told us she would bring them, but she never did. We ordered nachos that arrived cold, cheese unmelted. The waitress said she would be right back with plates, she never brought plates. We then ordered enchiladas from the lunch menu, as it was just after noon, yet we were charged for Dinner priced plates."
105,"I went here for lunch and I was extremely underwhelmed. I feel bad for giving this place 2 stars because the service was extremely friendly. <br/><br/>The chips and salsa was good (on the outside, it says ""free chips""... but isn't most Texmex places?) but there was only one type of salsa. <br/><br/>The food was extremely small in portions. I got the fish tacos in the lunch portion and it was $10. It was not filling, not THAT great (even Torchy's could do better..) and extremely small.<br/><br/>This place is gentrified - meaning it's beautiful but overpriced."
106,"Holy cow, this place exceeded my expectations in every way. The food was incredible. You can tell they take time to season things well. <br/><br/>The salsa is to die for and you can buy it by the pint or half pint, which we did. We got the enchiladas and the poblano sauce was amazing favorite.<br/><br/>Brandon was an excellent server. He was helpful and went above and beyond. <br/><br/>This is our new favorite Medan place...a little gem!"
107,"10/10 food <br/>10/10 vibes <br/>10/10 drinks <br/><br/>Between the amazing queso, variety of salsa, the sopaipilla (the size of my head omg) and fantastic chicken enchiladas, you can't go wrong. <br/><br/>The prickly pear margarita was also a 10/10. About to enter a food coma. You won't regret coming here."
108,"We discovered Vamonos during the pandemic and ordered takeout from them quite a bit! Their food is DELISH and travels really well, which can be hit or miss with takeout Mexican. We love the queso, quesadillas, fish tacos and poblano crema chicken enchiladas. Frozen margs to-go were/are CLUTCH."
109,"Cold food, store bought chips, understaffed, slow service. On the plus side, the prickly pear marg is good."
110,Awesome establishment. I will recommend to others and return. Presentation was great. Service was nice. Food was quality. Fast service. I'm leaving happy! And full. <br/>Salsa was good. Good lunch specials. Very clean! Don't miss out!
111,SO UNDERRATED!!! everything we had here was amazing and staff was super friendly and attentive. absolutely will be returning (soon)!!
112,"Needed to meet with some co-workers today and we decided to try out Vamonos.  We were not disappointed.  Our server was super friendly and cool and had some great recommendations for us.  I had the fish taco with the skirt steak enchilada and both were excellent.  The enchilada had a fried egg on top which is not something I have seen before, but after trying it I am definitely a fan.  Even expecting the food to be good based on the reviews, I was still surprised at how awesome everything tasted.  Overall a great experience, definitely will be back."
113,"Food &amp; drinks are amazing &amp; the owners &amp; staff could not be nicer. Best elotes, prickly pear margs, fish tacos, tinga enchiladas, amazing Happy Hour specials. Great COVID precautions. You can see from my other reviews that I am a hard ass, and this is consistently one of my absolute favorite places to spend my hard earned money."
114,We love Vamanos. Lots of parking availability. We've always had great service and great drinks/food!
115,"I've been to Vamanos a few times now and it's the perfect addition to the neighborhood! Amazing salsa, warm chips, great food, and AWESOME drinks. The frozen paloma is my favorite. For food, I recommend the migas, chicken enchiladas with poblano cream sauce, and puffy tacos!! <br/><br/>While the food and drinks are great, what really sets this place apart from the rest is the staff. The genuine joy and kindness they show each of their customers is really something. Couple that with a beautiful patio and you have my family's new favorite restaurant. <br/><br/>Welcome to the neighborhood, Vamanos!"
116,"I saw that they just opened and figured I'd stop in for lunch with my kids - the staff were so friendly and welcoming right away, and it was a really nice indoor/outdoor atmosphere.<br/><br/>We started with the free chips and salsa, which was really tasty, but had to give the Ranch Style Queso Blanco a try and it was delicious.<br/><br/>I went with the Power Bowl (Arroz, charro beans, jack &amp; Oaxaca cheese, super greens, pico de gallo, shredded carrot, radish, avocado, and shrimp) for my meal and it looked and tasted great. My kids all loved their selections, too. We'll be back."
117,"Best Mexican Martini ever!!!<br/>At least once a month, my husband and I visit Vamonos' restaurant. We love to start with ceviche and then either chicken Enchiladas or carnitas! Our favorite waitress Laura always provides the best services, but in general, Everybody is friendly."
118,"Came here for lunch and it was very tasty! Ordered drinks, queso and 4 entrées. The super greens salad was delicious - just added chicken. The carnitas were so flavorful and the service was top notch! I will definitely be back."
119,"This place is an A+<br/>The food is really great and it has a perfect balance between savory and spicy.  <br/>The place has adequate parking and they have great lunch especials.<br/>We ordered Queso Blanco (best I've ever tasted), Carnitas, Tacos and Quesadillas for the kids.<br/>Cocktails and Margaritas are amazing.<br/>The staff is very friendly and professional.<br/>They have vegan options available."
120,"FINALLY!  A comfortable, reasonably priced, non-hipster oriented restaurant in the hood!  We were greeted by the owner and his wife with genuine smiles and thankfulness to have us. Our server and the bartender were magnificent!  And the food...OMG, authentic, real, and SEASONED!  I am still pinching myself. <br/><br/>We ordered the queso blanco, beef enchiladas, and nachos with margaritas and a frozen Paloma. All were amazing!!"
121,"Wow, what a delicious dinner! We enjoyed the ceviche -  fresh, tart, and chock full of flavor. The shrimp tacos were divine, and thank you for not skimping on the shrimp as so many restaurants do! The beef fajita taco plate was also tasty. We loved the guacamole and marveled at the chips, still warm and super light. Everything was wonderful, and it was so great to break the monotony of home cooked meals with such a delightful repast. Gracias!"
122,Best Mexican food ever. Salsa has a great taste even though it's not spicy. Chicken tacos were flavorful. Another member of group had beef enchiladas and said best he's ever had. Fish tacos spicy with tons of flavor! Excellent place.
123,"The food here is good and is basically three stars -- but it earns an extra star because it's not 1) standard tex-mex food nor is it 2) fusion ""boutique Mexican"" food. The sauces and salsas are not tomato based like most places -- they actually blend up guajillo and chilaca chiles to make their salsas and sauces.  The Pablo's Platter was tasty and sufficient in quantity. I really enjoyed the chile sauce on the enchiladas -- it was savory not spicy, like it should be.  The tacos were good as well (although they used flour tortillas not corn) and the rice was nicely seasoned.  The refined beans were standard -- they could have used a bit more flavor, perhaps cooking them with bacon or chorizo grease.  The elotes (what they serve is actually esquites) are what I have come to expect in the USA -- sweet corn topped with mayo, lime, Chile and crumbled queso fresco.  In Mexico they're made with a variety of corn that is not sweet -- but it doesn't seem to exist in the USA. So that being said, their corn was seasoned well and I believe they actually use Mexican McCormick Mayonesa instead of a Hellman's. <br/><br/>The chips taste like something from a bag in the grocery store but the salsa is amazing. Roasted chiles, onion, maybe some cilantro and salt all chopped up. I couldn't detect any tomato in it and they use a dark chile like a chile pasilla I think -- tasty with a subtle bite.  I'd buy the salsa in jars if they sold it. <br/><br/>Overall some items are hit or miss, but I would go back.  After tasting their salsas I want to go back and try their Chilaquiles...I just hope they use different chips for it."
124,Austin - HEADS UP! This place is the best enchilada place in town. Better than Matt's El Rancho. Make sure you pay this place a visit. <br/><br/>Fantastic service.<br/><br/>Tasty margaritas - not too sweet or sour.<br/><br/>Enchiladas with Poblano Cream is the best! <br/><br/>Spread the word!
125,Great food and good service. Our waitress was helpful in deciding what we would like and gave good recommendations! Food was really good. The salsas were pretty hot!
126,Great food and drinks! Parking is kinda crappy but worth it! The Paloma is the best I've had!
127,Underrated jewel. Great Mexican food and amazing salsa. I love different types of salsas and vamanos has this salsa trio that is amazing and free. The redfish fajitas are my favorite and the street corn is awesome. Their drinks are super good as well but a tad expensive but where aren't drinks expensive these days. The frozen margaritas are really good and the ranch water is also really good.
128,"The elotes are the closest thing to authentic Mexican grilled corn I've found in Austin! SO GOOD! Cannot recommend that enough, especially if you're ever feeling nostalgic for grilled street corn from Mexico. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed my veggie enchiladas because the vegetables were grilled, which really makes a difference. My only reason for giving this 4 rather than 5 stars is because the veggie filling inside the enchiladas left me wishing for more flavor... maybe through a combination of seasoning, salt, and/or oil? But regardless, they were very satisfying because of the grill."
129,"Being from San Diego, we were definitely missing some good quality Mexican food.  So happy we found Vamonos! Not only was the food amazing, but the service was top notch! Highly recommend this spot!!"
130,"Great food and margaritas but what really stood out was the excellent, friendly service. Our server brought out some extra (delicious) salsas to try with our chips. You can tell everything is homemade. Great little neighborhood spot with outdoor seating - will definitely be back!"
131,"Vamonos has been good in the past, but we had a less than stellar experience this week. We placed an order for pickup and the soonest time was 1.5 hours later. Upon arrival, we were told it wasn't ready and there were other people ahead of us, and we would just need to wait for an undefined period of time. We ended up waiting another half hour at the restaurant."
132,"I'll try to be brief. I like the food; it's really good. The queso is amazing. The atmosphere is nice. For the most part, the staff is very friendly and helpful. But: One guy behind the bar, a guy with longer hair, has ""upsold"" me every time I've been in without telling me about an extra charge. The most recent time, I ordered the Pablo's Plate ($16 on the menu), and when my check came, it said Pablo's plate was $22. I asked the other bartender, who said that long-haired guy had told him it was an extra charge for the meat. My enchiladas were carnitas, and my tacos were adobo chicken--choices that were printed on the menu. I consider myself a semi-regular at Vamanos, because the food is so good. If you see the long-haired guy, beware. And watch your wallet."
133,"I don't get the naysayers. We had a pretty tasty meal here.<br/><br/>Seeing as it was my first time visiting, I got the Pablo's platter. The tacos were skirt steak and carnitas. The enchiladas were adobe chicken and beef picadillo. My faves were the carnitas taco and picadillo enchilada, but everything was well seasoned and prepared.<br/><br/>Additionally, my wife loved her fajita-style carnitas plate and commented upon how fragrant the rice was (it was studded with carrots and corn). <br/><br/>Pro tip: they apparently will bring more salsas out for your chips if you know to ask. One of the servers offered to bring out more than just the house salsa. Of these, I really liked the sweetly spicy habanero one."
134,"I love this place! Amazing margaritas, chips and salsa, and enchiladas. There are extra salsa choices if you go for dinner. The atmosphere is great and staff is very friendly. I've never had to wait for a table surprisingly. This has been my favorite Mexican food restaurant in Austin so far"
135,AMAZING! Stopped by since I'm new to the area. Loved the tinga and Strongly recommend the Paloma.
136,"ATTENTION! You need to add these three words to your vocabulary ""PUFFY TACO TUESDAY""! These guys are throwing down some puffy tacos like you wouldn't believe. These things are freaking delicious! And they only make them on Tuesdays (I know where I will be going for Happy Hour on Tuesday's from now on). As with any Mexican restaurant, their salsa will set the tone for the rest of your meal. This place did not disappoint, they have several really good salsas, including the best habanero salsa I have ever had. I tried their chicken taco and carnitas taco, both were on point! I will certainly be back for dinner soon and get the carnitas plate!"
137,"Great food, great service, top tier Margs. Everything you want out of a Tex Mex place. Remy was a fantastic host and bartender."
138,This spot is super cute and the service is good. I loved the appetizers ( elote and queso) and the salsa they give out but the enchiladas were not great. Tried the chicken enchiladas and the beef enchiladas and they weren't my favorite. The prickly pear margarita was also very good!
139,Best salsa around. Queso is cheesy amazing!!!Really impressive! Especially considering prices are so low for such quality.
140,"A hip, delicious spot in the Ridgetop area (just west of Mueller). All the food is delicious and flavorful. My go to is the Taco Salad. The environment is clean, modern, and fun. Plus the staff is incredibly nice and welcoming. Grab a bite the next time hunger strikes."
141,This is an outrage that this place has almost 5 stars. My first time coming here I got the beef fajitas and it was inedible. The meat is more like steak flavored gum. I wouldn't feed this to my dog because he would choke. 1.1 stars because the chips have a good crunch.
142,"The queso was milky and totally not what I would expect of a queso. The guacamole was slimy (might have been overmashed/overmixed?). The margaritas were too sweet, and frankly expensive for what they were. We decided to leave after the disappointing nature of the apps. <br/><br/>Giving it two stars instead of one because the folks working there were very nice and well-intentioned, but in a city with an abundance of solid Tex Mex options, they really need to do better."
143,Walking into this place all the colors are super vibrant the plants are perfectly decorated with such a cute aesthetic. <br/>Came in was greeted right away and seated rather quickly our waiter was super nice and very patient!<br/>.<br/>The margaritas were amazing ! <br/>And my friend got the house margarita she loved it . <br/>Fresh chips and salsa <br/>.<br/>The tacos were bomb dot com great Tex mex find
144,"This place is amazing! I cant imagine what it is like when eating inside but the food was great, the people were cool and the service was fast and efficient!!! I will definitely be eating here again!!!!!Chicken Enchiladas con salsa suiza pablano was amazing!! Def get extra sauce just for eating the free chips!!!!! : )"
145,Great happy hour and even better service! Best house salsa in Austin! Peña always has a smile on under his mask to greet you and management is great!
146,"I went here based on a recommendation from a local, and I was blown away. The ceviche was different but SO good. The queso was amazing as well! We had the chicken tinga puffy tacos also were amazing. The micheladas were on point! When I go back to Austin this will be my first stop."
147,"My friend and I decided to volunteer at a farm on Friday morning. After we finished we were ready for a margarita. After searching for margaritas in the area, I found Vamonos. When we first walked in the staff seemed busy, we waited at the front maybe 10 seconds before a man, who i can only imagine was either the manager or owner, approached us to seat us. <br/><br/>The staff, drinks, food, and just the experience, in general, was a great one. I would definitely recommend."
148,"I have to start by saying how sad I am to write this review!!!! We were SO excited for this place to open since we live so close and for the first 3/4 of the meal I kept saying to myself - it's their second day open well give it another chance once they've got their groove going - but honestly idk if we will. <br/><br/>So how did we get to this two star experience? Let's start from the beginning. <br/><br/>Vamonos took over the old bullflight space which was beautifulllll. They've got twinkle lights hanging and I love the paint on the walls but other than that....they took a space that was almost perfect and kind of ruined it...the blue accents are nice but the tables and chairs are really ugly. Bullflight was a big open space and they put a big yellow divider right in the center which at first I was like oh that's kind of cool - but really what it did was take a nice open space and divide it into two odd weird spaces.  <br/>The bar area is sectioned off but has dining room seating it, which we made the mistake of sitting in while at the bar (assuming it was bar area seating since it's in the sectioned off area)<br/><br/>Ok so we grab a drink at the bar, bravo to the bartender he's the only one working the bar he's beyond slammed and he's just knocking out drinks. <br/>So the drinks you ask? <br/>Meh. <br/>Margarita was too sweet and served without a line (not a huge deal he was slammed and it's the second night their open) my boyfriend didn't end up finishing it because it was overly sweet.<br/>I had the frozen prickly pear margarita which was to my surprise less sweet than he margarita on the rocks which was good. It wasn't crazy flavorful, it was a good drink, not amazing, idk if I'd pay $10 for it. I'd def pay $6. <br/>The rest of the drink menu was really underwhelming so we (shockingly) decided not to order another round. <br/><br/>Ok so dinner! <br/>We get a table and wait awhile to order, brand new restaurant growing pains totally expected. Things like someone asking if you want water and never returning, no one coming to take your order for a longgggg time. But there's chips and salsa and that. An keep you occupied for sure! (They were good but desperately needed salt which was not on the table.) <br/>So here's where we start having issues, we wait forever for a server but eventually order Boyfriend wants the tacos asks if he can do one of each, she says yes. I do school style taco salad no sour cream. Boom done! <br/>At least 20 minutes later she comes back and asks what kind of tacos he wanted, chicken? And he says one of each and she looks like blank and he's like if you can? And he's like if not then carnitas. Ok did she not put our order in within the last two boxes of chips? Whatever. She doesn't come back so we assume all is good. <br/>Awhile later my taco salad comes out, with sour cream. Womp womp. Sadly that's something hard to pick off so I mention it and they take it back. What was weird was the tacos didn't come with it? So we wait and my salad comes back out and still no tacos lol. <br/>So I'm waiting because it's rude to eat while the other person is waiting, we finally flag someone down to ask and they say they're working on them. Eventually we have tacos! Carnitas tacos. So I guess they couldn't do one of each? But our waitress just didn't bother to mention it lol. Kind of like taco roulette, you get what you get. He was happy he mentioned the carnitas because if he hasn't who knows what he would have got. <br/><br/>Up to this point we're still like, growing pains we will be back. <br/><br/>So how was the food? <br/><br/>So disappointing. <br/><br/>The taco salad / the shell was great but that was it. There was literally almost no meat in it, maybe less than 1/4 cup of ground beef and that's being generous. It was kind of bland it needed beans for sure, but it was 97% lettuce 1% cheese 1.5% radish and corn and 0.5% meat. <br/>The tacos were super greasy and the meat was hard. <br/>We waited foreverr for the bill and by this time the place is less than half empty and all the people that were sat after us have come and gone. We finally flag someone down for the check (like flag down we're sitting there credit card in hand ready.) and the bill is wrong lol <br/><br/>So here's the thing, it's priced like a high end Mexican restaurant but serving (at least right now) really not great hole in the wall style food. You can go to Tyson's tacos across the street and get better tacos for less.....if the food had been great then really everything else would be forgiven but the downgrade in decor, the not exciting drink menu with average drinks at high prices and the super disappointing food (take service out of it I'm sure they'll come into a grove) idk. Maybe we will try it again in a few months if it's still around, and if we do I really hope it's transformed with amazing food because we'd love to have another fun place in the neighborhood! <br/><br/>That concludes my novel, enjoy the rest of your day."
149,"Carnitas good, chips and salsa all of them good, Clase azul tequila good.  And as shown a churro pancake, try the el Camino whiskey and mezcal combo."
150,"We went here on Friday for happy hour and sadly didn't have the awesome experience that we had hoped we would. We live close by and watched with anticipation as the old Bullfight space was painted over. There's also no great Tex-Mex nearby except for El Caribe.<br/><br/>Salsa comes out with bottom of the bag chips. We're talking tiny broken orphan chips that should be used for migas and not for customers, so not the most auspicious beginning to the meal. Since it was happy hour, we got two prickly pear margaritas, queso blanco, and guacamole. The margaritas were perfectly frozen, but despite their being pink, there was absolutely no prickly pear flavor (we know because we ordered a regular frozen margarita afterwards and did a side-by-side comparison). Queso and guac were average AF.<br/><br/>Afterwards we had the local greens salad, Pablo's plato (with chicken), and grilled street corn. Let's start with the street corn: we'd be willing to bet our 401K that it wasn't grilled. No way in hell! The kernels were swimming in the crema and were definitely steamed. The salad was just OK--we liked the components, but the dressing didn't have much to it and there was way too much. The plato was the biggest disappointment though; the tacos and enchiladas really didn't have much flavor. We did like the refried beans.<br/><br/>Our server was very sweet and kind, but there were moments when were were struggling to communicate with her. The restaurant was also completely understaffed.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the weather was gorgeous and we had a pleasant time sitting outside with our daughter behaving herself, for the most part, in her highchair. (The place definitely attracts family crowds, FYI, in case that's not your thing.) We didn't love the food, but we didn't hate it, so we might be back again in a few months after things have hopefully improved."
151,Went for HH. Prickly pear frozen marg was good wasn't crazy about the regular marg on the rocks. Guacamole and salsa were good also and happy hour prices were good. Looks a little pricey for dinner but will be back to try more food!
152,"One can never have too many options for Tex Mex, and Vamonos is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The space is gorgeous, little-changed from its appearance when Bullfight occupied it. Food is solid and I expect it to get better as they settle in.<br/><br/>First time out the GF and I each ordered a lunch combo plate with a taco, an enchilada, and (of course) rice and beans. She had chicken and I had beef. The beef was good, the chicken even better. My beef taco was essentially a fajita taco, which was neither lacking nor stellar, and and the enchilada pleasant but a bit on the bland side. Rice and beans were served family style in their own bowls on the table, but there wasn't room on the main plate for them until we'd made space by eating our other food. That's a minor complaint, as I usually only start in on rice and beans after I've dug into the main dish.<br/><br/>Looking over the menu I knew a second visit was in my future, to try the Texas Gulf Redfish entree. I came back for it and let me tell you, it was gorgeous in presentation, generous in proportion, and pretty tasty, too. The piece of fish was a notch above what one would expect in a redfish dish priced under $20, but like almost every piece of fish priced under $20 it was slightly overcooked and a tad bit dry. Soo close to being so good. The accompanying frijoles were a pleasant surprise, garlicky with perhaps a bit of citrus - certainly not the same-old-same-old. Served on a sizzle platter, the fish was surrounded with garnish that featured onions in three different ways - spring onions, sautéed fajita style, and in the pico de gallo garnish. Maybe a bit much on the onions, but they were well-prepared in each case.<br/><br/>Service was good, with none of the unevenness that often comes with places newly-opened. Attentive, casual and friendly. Pricing seems right - a bit more than what you'd pay for sloppy, low brow Tex Mex, but less than the most spendy places in the category. I think there's plenty of opportunity for them to refine the dishes to their best potential, the aesthetics of the space are great, and I look forward to dining here again."
153,Puffy Taco Tuesday- I ordered the beef. My puffy taco was waaayyy too greasy. The place is very cool - sat outside on patio with plenty of misters to keep it pleasant. Others had much more delicious looking dishes and the menu looked promising. I'll go back and give it another try. One problem: $12 glass of chardonnay.  Mucho $$$!  Crazy!!!
154,"Well done! I ordered the Pablo's Plato with the carnitas tacos and chicken enchiladas verde. Both were freaking delicious, but the carnitas stole the show. My partner ordered chicken enchiladas with poblano crema - simply fantastic. Our foods was served with refried beans and rice. The beans were phenomenal, kind of weird to rave about beans, but the flavor and texture were splendid. The rice was fluffy and served in the traditional way with carrots and corn. We washed it down with an El Camino, which really hit the spot. It might knock your socks off if you're a lightweight. I should also note that our server, Michael, was attentive, friendly, and helpful. Top-notch service all around.<br/><br/>One of my pet peeves though, which didn't impact my review because they had a high-quality full-service bar, is the beer selection. It drives me wild when you go to an ethnic-esque restaurant and the beer menu strictly adheres to that ethnicity. We're in Austin, home to some of the best breweries in the region, if not the entire U.S. Swap out some of those run-of-the-mill beers for some local favorites. Just a suggestion.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about more specifics, like the rich and authentic flavors of each dish, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for you. For the price, you're not going to get better Tex-Mex in ATX. We left very pleased."
155,"What a gem!!! Vamanos has been my go to Mexican spot for the last few months and honestly they have ruined other Mexican restaurants for me. Their margaritas are so delicious and fresh with a HUGE tequila, mezcal and sotol list. Their food is always delicious with interesting flavor combos but still so reasonably priced! Our favorite is the chicken enchiladas with poblano crema. They really raise the bar for enchiladas.<br/><br/>They seem to be a little short staffed some weeknights, but I promise you it is worth the wait! And they give the best free chips and 3 different types of delicious salsa to snack on while you wait, so who even cares if it takes a little longer?! Love this place!"
156,"Came here for lunch on a weekday with two others, and was caught by surprise when I saw the bill! $120 for 3 lunches and 3 drinks. Food was good, but $120? Not with all the Tex-Mex in Austin. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my meal but everything had this distinct sweet taste. Not bad but I rather have some spice over sweet in my Mexican/Tex-Mex food. Also think it's strange that they put this emphasis on the free chips and salsa when literally every other place ever does that lol"
157,New favorite restaurant in Austin! Super chic and casual vibe. The service was unbelievable and the food was delicious. (Always) free chips and salsa. Their house margaritas and chicken enchiladas with the poblano sauce were fantastic. Can't wait to come here again during Happy Hour!
158,"Very good food! Loved the Ranch Tacos with carnitas, beans, and rice. Prickly Pear margarita with tajjn on the rim was good. Salsa has the best flavor I've tasted in a while. Only wishes: menudo, tamales, and flan."
159,"I'm rating this on more of the customer service, since I only ordered the Queso Blanco (which was freaking FABULOUS!!!) but they have their business down.  I called initially, had a few questions the person answering the phone (sorry can't recall his name it was 3pm on 12//12) was SUPER COURTEOUS and polite.  I had to call back since I did not have my card - They were super nice and organized (and multi-tasking) and remembered what I called to order earlier.   They said to make sure the dish was hot they will make shortly and to call when I arrived.  I love the ""spots to pick-up order"" are all named after a Tequila.  I called upon arrival, spot on again courteous on the phone, super nice and brought me my chips and delicious queso STAT!   I will have to try this place for a full-fledged meal soon."
160,This is our favorite place to eat in the hood and we ordered out due to this situation and they sent a wonderful note of thanks with queso! It's beyond fabulous so give them a delivery try during this tough times.  To the Vamanos staff and owner stay well!
161,"Nice change of pace from the typical TexMex.  Don't go it you want a big plate of cheese enchilada with chili gravy.  Do go if you want a plate of beautiful folded enchiladas with lovely red sauce (or tomatillo or other). Tacos were the real stand out on the menu although I though some were better than others.  Fish tacos were good, but the carnitas were dreamy.  Lovely margaritas."
162,"First time here. <br/>I've tried to come a few times but they are closed on Sundays. <br/>Nice looking space. Cool bar. <br/>At first I was a bit put off by my greeter, but my server more than made up for it. <br/>Not inexpensive for lunch. Only a few options and they are all $10-11. <br/>But from my first taste of their table salsa I was in!<br/>Smokey, flavorful but not too hot. Great chips too. <br/>My server brought me a habanero salsa and a Serrano/lime that were both spectacular. <br/>I had what sounded simple enough: beef enchiladas. These were so fresh and flavorful!<br/>Really some of the best I've had in Austin. <br/>Served with beans and rice on the side, I was definitely full by the end of my meal. <br/>I can't wait to come back!"
163,"We were looking for a spot with a patio and happened upon Vamanos. Our server was very helpful with menu recommendations and all of her suggestions were delicious. A few high points were the queso, carnitas, chicken enchiladas with poblano sauce, and the beef enchiladas con carne. It is very close by our son's neighborhood and we will be back!!!"
164,Came based on a recommendation from a close friend and so glad I did.  Ordered the queso blanco all the way and split Pablo's Plato.  The chicken enchiladas with poblano cream sauce are amazing as are the carnitas  and skirt steak tacos served in grilled corn tortillas.  Staff are friendly and made excellent recommendations.  They surprised us with a complimentary sopapilla to finish our meal. I looking forward to coming back.
165,"Tried this place twice and wanted to give it a chance. The food is pricey and not anything to write home about. Also, they should consider adding more heat to everything."
166,"This place is great Tex-Mex.  Honestly, it is more $$ but I'm happy to pay more for better quality food and ingredients.  Most Tex-Mex these days is really poor quality, so I'm hoping this place does well as it's one of the few doing it right. <br/>Also, my new favorite Queso in Austin!  Can't wait to come back to try the Tuesday Puffy Tacos!"
167,"Don't be put off by the concrete facade when you pull up. What awaits you inside more than makes up for this. Sadly, I was so hungry, I forgot to take pictures of the food. Trust me, the picture to flavor ratio scale was heavy on the taste side. I love this place. It was our first time there. First you are greeted by some excellent staff. Our sever just started there, but she had skill. She brought us some chips and salsa that were simply awesome. Between our group we had several items on the menu. Everyone reported excellent food with excellent flavor. Everything was prepared and presented nicely. Great for lunch. Go here, you won't be disappointed."
168,"This place pulled up on Yelp and we decided to try it. First of all, our server Peña was awesome! He was so jovial, friendly and just overall so pleasant. For good, we ordered the queso, ceviche, tortilla soup and veggie enchiladas. Everything was so good! The ceviche was my personal favorite. The sauce was so different (I think they use ZingZang) and the fish was really fresh! I will definitely be back!"
169,"We chose Vamonos based on previous Yelp reviews. Glad we did! We started with margaritas and queso. The queso is one of THE best I've had, and I've had a lot! Their salsas were excellent as well. I ordered chicken quesadillas- very good. My hubs ordered grilled fish tacos. They used red fish and he loved them. Our son ordered a taco and enchilada- said everything was tasty. Service was outstanding. We will be back!"
170,"Came to enjoy happy hour at the bar, drinks were great! Tried all of the rocks drinks, queso and the tortilla soup all of which were amazing. Chips and salsa at a texmex place is a big factor for me and the salsa is awesome, it's got the perfect kick to it. Make sure to try the El Camino, mad dank. Super close to home. If you get a soup on HH it's only $3. Can't beat it. Cool spot, great patio, good vibes."
171,Great food but they have closed in their patio (to open up the indoor seating area and keep it all air conditioned). No true outdoor seating. Stupid during a pandemic.
172,"Oh, I am in LOVE! Puffy Tacos like they make in San Antonio. Light, fluffy and just a tiny bit crisp with great flavor but not overly greasy. Picadillo filling and I added some guacamole. They only serve them on Taco Tuesday but they are worth the wait. The guacamole appetizer was the perfect mix of lime and tomato. Robert P's service was excellent and he could teach alot of other servers around town the right way to do the job. The temperature and noise level were good and the outside patio with a brick wall, fans and misters looks like a great option when it is less than 90°. This will be my new Tuesday lunch spot."
173,My new fav tex mex place!   Wow we shared the Pablo combo.  The skirt steak tacos had a unique Smokey flavor.  The enchiladas were divine.  Everything was so flavorful!  Our waiter was awesome as well.  We will be back!
174,"I don't normally leave reviews, but this restaurant was amazing. I had the chicken enchiladas with poblano crema and they were amazing. I grew up in Texas so I've had a lot of enchiladas in my life, and these were the best enchiladas I've ever had. The owner of the restaurant was very nice, and he told us that their food is made with all fresh ingredients and never preprepared. This was evident in the taste of the food. This restaurant is one of the most underrated restaurant in Austin, and I highly recommend it. The atmosphere is also really nice and clean."
175,This place is being slept on. Which is perfect <br/>I've never waited to get a table and the HH prices are fair. The food is above avg for Mexican in Austin . And they do serve LAlo tequila that's the best part ! Oh and the cactus frozen!!!!
176,"I've driven past this place hundreds of times, but have never stopped in. With tons of Tex Mex places in the surrounding area, it's easy to get lost in a sea of chips, salsa, and margaritas. Boasting four different and equally delicious salsas, piping hot tortillas to accompany my perfectly cooked plate of carnitas, and a margarita with a legit tajin rim - I'm pretty sold. Add on top of that the incredibly friendly and attentive staff, you have yourself a winner."
177,"Love everything about this place. THE FOOD, the ambiance, the fabulous staff. Tied for 1st for my favorite queso in town and their cocktails are top notch."
178,Had a nice dinner here tonight. Our family ordered basically every type of enchilada on the menu. Service from Cody was great. Food was really good. We will be back! Thanks
179,"Y'all, this spot is legit and understated. So fucking glad this place didn't close over covid. Let me start  by saying their staff is friendly AF. Seriously. I'm native Texan and been in Austin a minute and this is one of the Mexican food joints I would recommend to anyone. Their margaritas, salsa (if you like it hot, ask for the hot options), and anything involving chicken. My favorite is the power bowl - so damn good and I've had it with chicken and shrimp. I've brought family here and they were all happy with what they ordered (beef, fajitas, guacamole, etc)."
180,"They screwed up my order - put ground beef in queso for a vegetarian - then tried to blame the person that ordered saying that they didn't specify, when they absolutely did (not sure what's unclear about ""queso, but vegetarian without the beef""). <br/><br/>The rice and refried beans both taste like water. I'm not even sure how that's possible, but they have absolutely no flavor, including salt.<br/><br/>I've been wanting to come here since I heard they were taking over Bullfight's old space. I love everything that Parkside does - Olive &amp; June is one of my favorite restaurants in town - but this is a huge miss. Nope."
181,"My first two visits to Vamonos for dinner were really good. Unfortunately, lunch today left me feeling disappointed and questioning if I'll be back anytime soon. <br/><br/>Quick overview: the food is tasty, the chips and salsa are fresh &amp; free, drinks are made well and yummy, the interior and patio ambience are nice, and dinner service is quick &amp; friendly.<br/><br/>The bad: our lunch server was way too fake nice and kept trying to upsell us without disclosing the charges. My friend agreed to add avocado to her taco plate and when it arrived we were both surprised at how little she received. We assumed it would be an extra charge, but we had no idea it would end up costing $3.50 for three tiny slivers of avocado. We know avocados are pricey, and we know that restaurants charge more for things, but this way ridiculous. Prior to this, we noticed the two girls sitting next to us had an obviously displeased reaction to their bill and they didn't say anything to the server, but there were a lot of eye rolls and open mouths so I figured something was up with an unexpected upcharge. When we saw the unusually high price for an 1/8 of an avocado on our bill, I knew exactly why they had the reaction they did. We decided to say something to our server since the restaurant is new and we thought maybe it was mistake, but our server let us know that it was the correct charge and that he would let the managers know since they were in the middle of a manager's meeting. So, we sat there while he went over at that exact moment to inform the management about our feedback (awkward), and then came back with the bill and no adjustments. He said that they're a new restaurant and they're still working things out, but that they will take our feedback into account. They didn't take the outrageous charge of the avocado off, not even 50% off, none of it. I have no problem paying for something and getting my money's worth, but when you try to take advantage of customers by charging $3.50 for three tiny slivers when you can purchase an entire organic avocado at the store for $1.99 it really starts to look like you're scamming people when you're making $28 off one avocado. Heck, I would expect to pay $3.50 for a small side of guacamole, but not for sliced avocado.<br/><br/>I really thought this would be a regular spot for me since I like the food and had two good experiences, but I'm not sure it's worth it to come back after seeing how they handled this avocado debacle."
182,"3 stars to the deco and friendly service! Nicely done, loved all the plants <br/><br/>Food is overpriced. $10 for a cup of guacamole (need seasoning), rice and beans...not good. Too much cheese on the tacos (and I love cheese)! <br/>We also ordered the chicken enchiladas in green sauce...had very little sauce and lots of cheese, again. <br/><br/>It has potential."
183,Great food and great service. There were several of us in our party and we were all well tended to with our food and beverages. They have FOUR different kinds of salsa. The food was amazing. We really enjoyed ourselves here
184,I must say these are the best enchiladas I probably have ever tried in my life. I have not had the luxury to dine in yet but will continue to take out until covid is over and can't wait to sit on their patio ASAP! HIGHLY reccomend
185,"Yummy food in a cute locale - also, we took our kiddos and felt totally comfortable - bar and all! Staff was super welcoming and their patio is awesome! Good things all around!"
186,"I love this neighborhood joint. Good food, great margs, friendly attentive servers, kid-friendly. This evening, there was an issue with my entree. Our server Michael immediately took care of it and graciously removed both entree and replacement from the bill. Service like that makes me want to come back again. That, and the salsa!"
187,"First time here and loved it. Great food, service, and decor. Highly recommend the beef puffy tacos on Tuesdays! The happy hour prices are a nice perk too. The outdoor patio (covered) was comfortable and all COVID precautions were followed. The tables were nicely separated. Will definitely be back!"
188,This place is so good! The enchiladas taste so close to home! Just like my grandma made them at home! Make sure to check this place out!
189,"The salsa and the cheese dip are delicious, it's very different from all the other places I have been. The portion for each plate are just right made with local farm produces, highly recommend. The atmosphere has a modern and lively feel to it."
190,"Was in town for just a few days for Christmas so I decided to invite friends and family to have drinks and food at Vamonos. It was a great central location and we had close to 30 people there. My son and I just started Keto (yes, right before Christmas), and we were able to make the menu work for us. We skipped the chips, but ate the queso. It was amazing. So good that it wasn't weird eating it on its own. For a drink, I went for a ranch water with Casa Amigos (I know alcohol has sugar, but this drink was perfect for me). My husband was drinking the frozen palomas and he loved them! For food, I had the taco salad, minus fried tortilla shell, and added avocado and extra protein. We also had some extra queso on the table (we ordered a lot of quesos) and I added that on top too. Delicious and filling. Peña was our server and he was friendly and attentive. The owner, Chris, was there as well and stopped by several times to make sure the party was happy. <br/><br/>Overall, great experience. We will definitely go back!"
191,"We absolutely loved the food. The ""Queso Blanco"" is amazing. We loved the carnitas and skirt steak. Excellent service a"
192,"I love this place! I normally don't cheat on Eldorado but I had to check this place out. It's a very cool spot, great enchilada, poblano cream sauce to DIE FOR, amazing salsas! I've been 4 times and haven't had a bad experience. You won't be disappointed!"
193,"Great spot for lunch or dinner. Awesome ambience, family friendly and delicious food. The chicken enchiladas are creamy and flavorful. Definitely get the queso too, you won't be disappointed."
194,"Finally found the perfect Mexican spot. Delicious food, reasonably priced, and great service."
195,Outstanding service and quality of food. Extremely flavorful which is what we all look for. Staff could not have been more friendly. We will be back for sure
196,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Austin. The food is spectacular and the service is 5 stars. The management and staff treat you like a person not a number. I would recommend any one to come and eat here. There margaritas are to die for, best in town."
197,"Great salsa presentation, the Prickly Pear Margarita, and excellent menu variety made this place my new favorite of the budding Airport area. I had the Ven Pescar redfish tacos which were cooked well, and the habanero salsa gave them a nice warm flavor that is pleasing to remember. I can't wait to explore other dishes in the future."
198,Awesome prickly pear margarita! Tortilla soup was good and the chips and queso are unique. Love the ambiance and super convenient location.
199,"Best enchiladas I've ever had! Incredible queso and margaritas, as well. Very kind wait staff and good music make for excellent vibes. I sympathize over the sometimes slow service, as they seem to be short-staffed due to Covid, but the phenomenal food and lighthearted atmosphere more than make up for a few extra minutes wait!"
200,"Pretty delicious! And a very cute spot with bright colors. This restaurant reminds me of some of my favorite Tex Mex spots like Ninfa's and El Tiempo in Houston, with a smaller and less varied menu. The redfish tacos are super fresh and I love the slaw on top. The salsa is smoky with the chips. I liked but didn't love the guacamole. Will definitely be back soon, want to try out the happy hour."
201,"The food was original, the service was kinda slow, the food not too spicy which is good.  There were only 2 waiters working there on Sunday, which was not really enough to service all the people there in the restaurant, I would suggest at least 3 waiters or waitresses working during the normal work day.  They were extremely friendly. <br/><br/>I tried the beef skirt tacos, they were excellent and the carnitas, pretty good, but only one single corn tortilla instead of 2.  I do not think they tortillas were homemade because they tasted a bit stale.  The chicken enchiladas were pretty tasty with the Verde Sauce.  The dark salsa that is served with the chips was top-notch, rich and full of flavor.  Wow, I would buy this sauce by the quart if I could.<br/><br/>If the service had been faster I would definitely be giving them a 4 star.<br/>I would like to return at a later date to try the steak skirt, I have a feeling that will be a pretty good dish."
202,"Could not get past the terrible service. Literally. First time we went we were seated and then waited for 10 minutes only to have someone come tell us that the kitchen was now closed. It was the middle of the day! Second time we put our name on the waiting list. 20 minute wait. No problem. 25 minutes rolls around and we ask to see where we are on the list and they said they called our name already? We didn't hear it. But okay. So we said how long until the next available table. They said sorry. You have to go to the back of the line. Nope. We walked out, like most should."
203,"So yummy, plus delicious frozen drinks and fabulous outdoor seating. The queso blanco is a must have!"
204,"I've been here about 5 times now and it's always on point! Not quite like mommas but it's definitely a close 2nd. The service is amazing and the food is great; the cueso is a cheesey mixture of sausage/ avacado/&amp; jalepenos; they have the margaritas down pat, enchiladas are tasty, ranch carnita tacos are delicious, and they ACE the beans and rice test with lots of fluff and flavor. See you guys soon!"
205,"Longtime Cherrywood Resident, had to review after our 1st time there. Excellent Poblano Cream sauce on my chicken enchiladas and the chicken inside was perfect. Delicious red drum taco. Presentation was lacking for the taco as it was in my enchilada sauce so I had to fork and knife it, no big deal. I had tea--delicious iced tea-he had a Paloma and a Michelada which I drooled over, they looked fantastic. I had to pick up kids so I was ice-tea-ing it. He got nachos, they looked and seemed to be excellent, he inhaled them. Our waitress was very nice.<br/>Very new restaurant so it took a while for everything, which we expected as it is just getting going. <br/>Advice, whether it's wanted or not, is to turn the music DOWN and maybe some more chilled out Mexican music? I LOVE Mexican music, am listening to Horizontes sp? on KUTX right now. I have also been a waitress for 13 years in my 20s, so I get the loud music thing..Maybe I am getting old, fair enough...The music during dinner was making me cringe a bit. Sorry!!! It was mixed in with some good stuff...More good music!! <br/>Finishing with more good...Great prices for everything!!!! Lots of families there, I think we are all excited about a new, affordable restaurant near our hood. Vamonos!! Couldn't figure out how to do the upside down exclamation point on my computer :)"
206,"Went mid day for lunch on a Saturday. We were greeted by management who was very friendly and inviting. He explained they were open less than a year. Server was ok, for having 2 tables our drinks came to us pretty slow. He may have been doubling as a bartender, we aren't sure but everyone knows drinks should come quickly. Chips were meh at best. Tasted very generic. Salsa, whole other story. Smoky, perfect amount of spice. Yum! Only complaint is there wasn't enough of it as it came in very tiny serving dish. Queso was very good, not to thin, great flavor, almost perfect! <br/><br/>Plates were beautiful and fresh and very tasty. Margaritas were better than average. Location left something to be desired but regardless We will be back."
207,"Very delicious food !! Cute restaurant, Instagram worthy!! Great music and Awesome customer service (specially Brandon). I would recommend the Pablos plate if your really hungry and the Tijuana Cesar salad for something still delicious but light."
208,"Not remarkable. We ordered the Ranch Tacos plate. The meat could have been cut up a little more and the flavor wasn't too my liking. It really wasn't our kind of place, especially for the prices. I doubt we will be back."
209,First time here and we will come back. Fresh salsa to start with perfect margarita says my hubby.  Poblano chicken enchiladas excelled and redfish tacos the best.  Service A+.
210,"I'm tempted to keep my damn mouth shut so they don't get too popular, but I just stopped in to try them out and everything was fantastic! The service was great, the food was yummy and very imaginative. Faithful to texmex tradition, but at the same time a new take on the concept. A lot of attention to detail and I can't wait to return!"
211,"For a quick lunch spot, this is great.  Since I was with my kids I didn't get to try their margarita. I heard they were good. We have a al pastor taco and chips and queso.  Kids loved the rice and queso.  Friendly service and good food."
212,"The food here is great, but the service is horribly slow. This is our second time here and both times the service has been slow. And not just getting our food, but little things like refilling drinks, refilling chips, etc."
213,"Taco Tuesday wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. They have a special for puffy tacos on Tuesday which looked good but I didn't try them. I had a steak taco and a fish taco that were both disappointing to be honest. The enchiladas were pretty good. Service was great, chips and water were refilled promptly. They have four salsas that you get for free with the chips. And they are delicious. The quest and guacamole are both a little over priced at $10 for a bowl. The queso was delicious but the guacamole was average."
214,"Excellent patio! We love coming here because it close to us and has a really fantastic patio. The restaurant is very child friendly which is great. I love the queso. It is absolutely amazing. Really enjoy the prickly pear margaritta. Been a little underwhelmed with the entrees thus far, but maybe We just havent found the right one yet. Service is very nice."
215,"Love this place!  Went there with family to celebrate two birthdays; the service was beyond excellent and the queso was soooo good. Our bartender/waiter (Pena) provided some recommendations for drinks and food, based on this being our first time there and the drinks and food were great!  <br/>Next time I'm there I'll be ordering the frozen Paloma and making sure Pena waits on us!!!"
216,Excellent food! What a pleasant surprise. We had no idea what we were walking into. The chips and salsa are delicious and the enchiladas are amazing. I'm already planning my next trip back!
217,"Delicious, comforting Tex-mex, great drinks, great service. It's a little bit more expensive than I'd expect, but I'm fine with it because, like I made clear, it's delicious."
218,Stopped by this place as they are now open for lunch. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. The food was delicious. I had the two tacos with shrimp. I like how they serve the beans and rice family style.  Overall a wonderful experience- I will be back!
219,"Dined at Vámonos in early May and service was very friendly.  There is also a generous portion of chips and salsa to welcome you.  This place is good for a healthier version of Mexican and Tex-Mex dishes, but overall flavor is not overly impressive.  I felt like I could cook these dishes at a comparable level at home."
220,"Plenty of Tex Mex in town, this place was expensive and not very memorable. What it did for me was paying a lot for a taco dish that had store bought tortillas. It killed the flavor. I've eaten at many other Tex Mex places that offered better dishes and cheaper."
221,"As someone who is a manager in the service industry it hurts me to write this review but the experience we had at Vamonos was truly awful. <br/>We were outside and were not greeted until the host noticed we had been out there too long to not have waters. Not a big deal. <br/>My husband ordered our cocktails and when the waitress dropped them off she spilled my cocktail on him. Again, accidents happen. We understand that. But the service just continued in a spiral. I asked for water and didn't get it. My husband ordered a draft beer and got a different drink. When we finally did get our check the spilled cocktail was on it and then we sat there for quite some time with the card ready to go before someone else had to run it only because they wanted our table for people who were waiting and the entire time we did not talk to a manager."
222,"Amazing service. Peña is a great bartender and super hospitable. Beautiful decor! The chicken enchiladas have a subtle yet fulfilling smokey-taste to them, because they cook their food atop a wood burning flame. Super impressed. Everyone should stop by! I had a margarita and idk why it tasted so good, maybe because they were playing great tunes but I'll def be coming back for more!"
223,Oh my word. I'm so picky about Mexican. This place is legit. Queso Margs  Skirt Steak  and it wasn't over priced. Casual but not so casual you couldn't take a date.  Robert was our waiter. Very nice . This place deserves to stay.
224,I've been twice so far and the service was good both times especially for a newly opened restaurant.  I had the enchiladas as well as the queso.  Queso was delicious!  Enchiladas were decent- the second time I went I changed the sauce and it really helped.  I heard the skirt steak was very good too.  It will definitely be in the restaurant rotation for me and look forward to going back again soon.
225,"This is my new favorite restaurant! Loved everything about it. Great Food, Drinks, Music and hospitality. We started with a few drinks and appetizers. I had the Paloma ( totally recommend).  The Ceviche was  flavorful and made with red fish. The guacamole was also very tasteful as was the queso. I ordered the red fish tacos and drizzled the habanero sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. My husband ordered the beef enchiladas and said they were unique (not your ordinary Tex-mex enchiladas). I honestly can't wait to return."
226,"The salsas are handmade, rice and beans have awesome taste,  Adobo chicken and shrimp have exquisite taste. It was my 1st time there, but I WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!"
227,Best shrimp quesadillas and queso dip in Austin!   <br/><br/>Pena is the real deal when it comes to those margaritas on the rocks... sorry Ruben :)
228,"I wish I could give more stars! The food, drinks, and  atmosphere were on point!!! The frozen PALOMA was very smooth and yummy, and they don't use well tequila :) ... The waitstaff were very attentive and very sweet. I'll be back! Checkout their HH."
229,"The very best Tex Mex in Austin experienced in a long time. Waitstaff treat guests like royalty. Fantastic original hot Salsas. Superb margaritas. The best carnitas ever. Warm fresh made sopapillas. Super cool patio with chilling mist fans, dog friendly. Vamonos!!"
230,"Wow, this is very good Mexican food. I grew up in Del Rio and this is as close to home as I could imagine. Great fajita taco, the meat could be a bit more tender, but excellent beef enchiladas! Salsas were excellent, try the habanero (hot, but not crazy hot. Excellent flavor, which is unusual for habanero). Excellent margaritas, need I say more?"
231,First time here- I've been to this location when it was Bullfight so I was interested to see what they did with it. This will definitely be a go to spot. Salsa was great as was the queso blanco. Margaritas cold and strong. Food was fresh and tasty. There were a few small hiccups ( there was a little wait for a waitress but when someone noticed we hadn't been helped they stepped in and got our drink and appetizer order. Being that it's an inside/ outside restaurant there were some flies that kept buzzing around ( a little annoying ) We will definitely be coming back and trying more things
232,"So freaking good! Peñas is the best waiter anywhere. Seriously, some of the best food in Austin. Totally worth the drive. Enjoy!"
233,"This place has a great ambiance, and some pretty tasty margaritas! Perfect place to beat the heat. Got the cheese enchiladas, and I found them to be pretty standard the dishes on the neighboring tables looked good, but I found there to be limited vegetarian options. The service was super friendly and attentive though!"
234,"Vamonos has been open less than a week, but after my first visit, I predict it will be my go-to Mexican restaurant. It has a casual upscale interior Mexican vibe even though it's reasonably priced and bills itself as a Tex-Mex eatery. They play great music at a volume that doesn't require shouting to be heard and... <br/><br/>the food is fabulous! My daughter and I ordered Power Bowls for $13 - Mine had tasty grilled redfish and my daughter's had delicious carnitas. They both tasted fresh, full of salad fixings, rice and the protein (which was included in the price). My wife had enchiladas verdes even though they weren't on the menu. The enchiladas were folded in half, which reminded me of enchiladas potosinas that I once had in San Luis Potosí. I also had a good house margarita on the rocks. Staff were friendly and service was good. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this neighborhood gem on Airport Blvd!"
235,"Amazing!  Delicious food, exceptional service and vibrant atmosphere!  Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here and it is instantly a new Favorite!"
236,Fantastic find!  Read about Vamonos in an article and couldn't be more pleased that we tried it. Great staff. Excellent Mexican martini with an impressive selection of tequilas. Ceviche was excellent. Chicken enchiladas were exceptional with wood fired flavor of chicken. Fish tacos also great. Highly recommend.
237,"Good food but the most abysmal service I've ever had. They staffed one waiter for a party of 20 that had been reserved a month in advance. One girl got a margarita dumped down her back and it took two hours for another girl to get a drink. Would never, ever, ever come back here with a party of more than 2."
238,"Good happy hour prices on apps and drinks but the food is unremarkable and, honestly, nothing much to write about. In the competitive restaurant landscape of Austin, this one is not worth revisiting."
239,"We walked into a restaurant with beautiful colors and bad a$$ music. We were seated immediately and brought an amazing round of salsas and chips. I recommend getting your taste buds wrapped around there green salsa (this is a minced chili and lime type salsa). We sat by the doors with a half inside and half outside type atmosphere. (Temperature was perfect  around 6-7pm. Around 73 degrees as I write this.) All four of us ordered shots from a very nice list of tequilas. I had the ranch tacos and a ""ranch water"" for my drink. I recommend the ranch tacos because they're juicy and flavorful and just all around amazing. PLUS, you can pick and choose 3 different proteins if you want. One per taco of course lol. I had the red fish and two chicken. The flavor is AMAZING! All around amazing staff, suuuuuper good waitress, the manager was on the ball with the front of the house. This place is definitely a great place to check out. 5 stars!"
240,"Wish we'd tried this cute place earlier! Love it! GREAT marg on the rocks and another drink (can't rem name) that tastes similar to an Old Fashioned was excellent. The salsa is perfect!<br/>Two small dings: after being seated, we were apparently forgotten but finally got a very sweet server; and they need to step up seasoning on the beans and rice. We found pouring the great salsa on the rice really transformed it. <br/>Back to the good stuff. The chili con carne on the cheese enchiladas is addictive. So nice to see white cheese instead of orange. Can't wait to try the white queso, which I hear is fantastic. But the star of the evening was the ceviche-- don't miss this treat! We compare everyone's ceviche to the traditional one served at Manuel's on Jollyville Rd and this one is the only one that comes close. Loved it! <br/>So this place is a definite winner and I can see them getting even better as they work out any newbie kinks, so we plan many future visits!"
241,Chips and salsa were solid. Queso was great (I'm a super picky judge of queso.) I ordered the margarita which was perfect.. not too sweet. I also ordered the ranch water which was super light and refreshing - for the ladies who are trying to watch their figures. Tortilla soup is $3 on happy hour! Great spot when the weather is nice.. part of the window wall slides open to the patio letting in the perfect breeze. Cool atmosphere. Happy to have this place open up right by the house!
242,"We were really excited to try this place since its in a location close to us and the hype of really good tex mex stepped up a level however the overall experience was pretty disappointing. We arrived around 11:45 and seated right away on the patio. The Margaritas were really well balanced and you could taste the tequila. Service seemed to be good at times and then non existent. They need to work on consistency. The salsa was flavorful however it really needed salt. One thing we noticed is that NOWHERE on the menu does it say the lunch menu is ONLY Monday-Friday. When informed of this the dishes we were ordering were $4 more a piece which really irked me as it was not listed as so on the menu. My wife got the chicken enchiladas with the cream sauce and I got the Chile con carne beef enchiladas. My enchiladas were fantastic however what transpired after than makes me not want to visit this establishment again. My wife halfway through noticed their was no chicken in the enchiladas only cheese and onion and we brought that up to the waiter and after he comes back he says ""I'm sorry I guess the kitchen screwed up."" They made no offer to make it right or offer any sort of discount on behalf of their error. Comping the dish would be going above and beyond to serve their customer. We did not expect that but a simple gesture to comp one of our $4 beers (we each got 2 beers after paying $9 each for a margarita) would have been more than enough of a nice gesture to make up for the mistake. But the fact they admitted the mistake and made no attempt to rectify the situation makes me think they don't really care about their customers returning which is sad because my food were some of the best enchiladas I've had in Texas. Sure I could have asked to speak to a manager but all in all we didn't want to make a fuss and all that. I understand growing pains but it may be awhile if ever we decide to return."
243,"Had puffy beef tacos with rice and beans.  Taco Tuesday special.  Really delicious.  Every thing from salsa to beef, beans and rice tasted freshly made and was superb.  Try it I think there isn't another place in Austin that serves better Tex Mex."
244,"My wife and sister and brother-in-law really enjoyed the food and drinks! The Paloma margarita was tasty and had a nice punch. The cheese enchiladas and shrimp dishes were prepared perfectly. Pena, our waiter, provides us with recommendations and was professional/pleasant guy! Will definitely go back for more!"
245,"Looks like Vamanos has worked out some of the kinks of its soft opening! Despite living a few blocks away the 2 hr wait and mediocre reviews kept us away - until today! We made it just in time for their 3-6 PM (Mon-SATURDAY) happy hour and were seated immediately. My prickly pear margarita was pretty good (not too sweet but not as tart as others in town) and the guacamole serving was generous and delicious. We tried the tomatillo chicken enchiladas and the Pablo plate which included your choice of two enchiladas and two tacos. As both of these options came with rice and beans, they dispensed them ""family style"" in small bowls. Both enchiladas tasted very fresh and flavorful but the tacos were lackluster (tortilla + meat + onion, cilantro), particularly as Tyson's Tacos has perfected the taco next door. All in all Vamanos is a welcome addition to our neighborhood with attentive service, fresh ingredients and some fun cocktails. It still feels a couple of dollars overpriced per item but is slightly more upscale than the rest of the block and avoids the pitfalls of other overpriced locales (like making you pay for chips and salsa). 4/5 stars!"
246,the queso is unique and delicious! fajita was very flavorful from their wood fire grill! will come here again!
247,"Americanize Tex mex, over priced for the amount of food. Awesome palome! Great outdoor seating and staff was super friendly. Just not worth the money."
248,I started off with a delicious frozen Paloma with Chile salt rim. The chips are warm and the salsa is smoky and tasty. The habanero sauce is sweet with a spicy kick. Queso blanco is outstanding. I ordered a Pablito platter which comes with choice of enchiladas and tacos.My cheese taco with poblanos crema  and carnitas taco were very good. This is a sleek space with a friendly and efficient staff. I will definitely be back!!
249,Great spot! The food is delicious -- I had the Ven Pescar plate -- and the service was stellar!
250,"Stopped by for some drinks and apps.  Wait staff amazing,  food was delicious and atmosphere was very chill.  Definitely coming back for meal.  Recommending to everyone!!!!!"
251,"Excellent service, salsa, and food. I highly recommend for dinner or lunch. Excellent happy hour and authentic Mexican food."
252,"Unfortunately, just not that good. Even the salsa was bland. They need to work on their flavoring. The ranch water was good though."
253,"We came from Houston all the way over here and it was worthy!!! Can wait to bring my whole family here! .... I loved the service, the food was delicious and the prices are very reasonable!  We need a VAMONOS in Houston please!!!!!!"
254,Food and service here is awesome! The outdoor patio is so cute and well designed. Will definitely be back!
255,"Man, I so wanted to love this place. It's within walking distance of our house and we just now had the opportunity to give it a shot. It's also super warm and cute on the inside. First, the service is friendly, but kind of terrible. Everyone's rushing around but nothing's really happening. No real list at the hostess station, just an ""I'll find you..."" (ok?).  When we were finally sat, people were zooming by, but everyone ignored us (and we were not tucked away...). No water. No chips and salsa (not the end of the world, of course). The wait staff was slow to approach our table and take orders. The drinks took a looong time (you know, where you feel like just going back there and slinging them yourself?). And, after all that? The food and drinks were pretty mediocre and kind of pricy.  We split the skirt steak for 2 and it was lacking flavor. Also, 10 bucks for an order of guac? I do not like giving bad reviews on Yelp and I'm only saying this hoping that it helps. We have decided to give it one more try before abandoning it completely."
256,"Day trip to Austin, and found out about Vamonos via Eater Austin. The recommendation was strong so we had high hopes. The good: great service, very friendly and on top of drink refills. Loved the decor. Clean restrooms. Guacamole and beans were tasty. The not-so-good: way expensive (our tab for guacamole, two entrees and 2 soft drinks was $48 - this was a Saturday at lunch). The fish tacos were disappointing - cold, store bought tortillas, the ""slaw"" was not pretty/appetizing to look at and way overdressed in a spicy sauce that made everything soggy. My husband thought the chicken enchiladas were underwhelming. He left half his plate. Which he NEVER does when it comes to enchiladas. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, maybe it is the difference between regional takes on Tex Mex - especially given such strong reviews here, we must have missed something. We wish them success, but likely wouldn't be back."
